His average dipped to .298, but he still managed to collect 100 RBIs. Thompson's throwing remained strong as he turned in one of the finest defensive performances of his career. Despite appearing in only 119 games in the outfield, he led the league in outfield fielding percentage (.974), outfield assists (28), and double plays from the outfield (11). One sports writer noted that, even at age 38, Thompson \\"possessed an arm that the fastest sprinters in the big league had a lot of respect for.\\" As a team, however, the Phillies fell to eighth place in the National League with a 62-68 record.  In 1897, at age 37, Thompson was sidelined by pain and appeared in only three games. Some accounts suggest that Thompson's absence from the lineup may have also been the result of his not getting along with Philadelphia's new manager George Stallings. Without Thompson, the 1897 Phillies dropped to 10th place with a 55-77 record.  Before the 1898 season began, Thompson gave an interview in which he questioned the Phillies chances to compete in 1898: \\"What are the Phillies' chances this season? Six clubs, Cincinnati Baltimore, Boston, New York, Cleveland and Brooklyn are bound to beat them, and they will have to fight hard to lead the second division, and I very much doubt if they can do that.\\" Though his loyalty to the Phillies was questioned, Thompson did return in 1898 and was batting .349 with 15 RBIs, five doubles, three triples, a home run after 14 games. However, Thompson opted to leave the team in May 1898 and return to his home in Detroit. His sudden retirement has been attributed to a \\"combination of homesickness and chronic back pain.\\" Other accounts indicate that continued tension with manager Stallings contributed to Thompson's decision to retire.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"What was his highest score\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"was batting .349 with 15 RBIs, five doubles, three triples, a home run after 14 games.","rationale":"The context is a description of the experiences and events surrounding Thompson's baseball career.

Son of Labdacus, he was raised by the regent Lycus after the death of his father.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology , Eteocles ( / tikliz / ; Ancient Greek :  ) was a king of Thebes , the son of Oedipus and either Jocasta or Euryganeia . The name is from earlier * Etewoklewes (  ) , meaning \`\` truly glorious '' . Tawagalawas is thought to be the Hittite rendition of the name . Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother without knowing his relationship to either . When the relationship was revealed , he was expelled from Thebes . The rule passed to his sons Eteocles and Polynices . However , because of a curse from their father , the two brothers did not share the rule peacefully . Eteocles was succeeded by his uncle , Creon .\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Jocasta, also known as Jocaste (\\"Iokást\\" ) or Epicaste ( \\"Epikaste\\"), was a daughter of Menoeceus, a descendant of the Spartoi, and Queen consort of Thebes, Greece. She was the wife of first Laius, then of their son Oedipus, and both mother and grandmother of Antigone, Eteocles, Polynices and Ismene. She was also sister of Creon and mother-in-law of Haimon.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Electryon was the son of Perseus and Andromeda, and king of Tiryns and Mycenae or Medea in Argolis. He married either Anaxo, daughter of his brother Alcaeus and sister of Amphitryon, or Eurydice daughter of Pelops. His wife bore him a daughter Alcmena and many sons (Stratobates, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, Amphimachus, Lysinomus, Chirimachus, Anactor, and Archelaus). Electryon had an illegitimate son Licymnius by Midea, a Phrygian woman. The six sons of Pterelaus, King of the Taphians, descended from Electryon's brother Mestor came to Mycenae to claim a share of kingdom. When Electryon spurned their request, they drove off his cattle; Electryon's sons battled against them, and all but Licymnius (on one side) and Everes (on the other) died. Everes sold the cattle to Polyxenus of Elis. Amphitryon, Electryon's nephew and promised in marriage to Alcmena, bought the cattle and returned them to his uncle, but accidentally killed him as he threw his club at one of the cows. Electryon's brother Sthenelus seized the throne of Mycenae, charged Amphitryon with murder, and sent him into exile.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Antigone is the daughter/sister of Oedipus and his mother, Jocasta. The meaning of the name is, as in the case of the masculine equivalent Antigonus, \\"worthy of one's parents\\" or \\"in place of one's parents\\".\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Labdacus was the only son of Polydorus and a king of Thebes. Labdacus was a grandson of Thebes' founder, Cadmus. His mother was Nycteis, daughter of Nycteus. Polydorus died while Labdacus was a young child, leaving Nycteus as his regent, although Lycus soon replaced him in that office. When Labdacus had grown, he ruled Thebes for a short time. He died while he was still young, after he lost a war with the king of Athens, Pandion, over their borders. Apollodorus writes that he, like his cousin Pentheus, was ripped apart by women in a bacchic frenzy for disrespect to the god Dionysus. Lycus became regent once more after his death, this time for Labdacus' son, Laius. His descendants were called the \\"Labdacids\\", and included his son Laius, who fathered Oedipus; Oedipus' children were Polynices, Eteocles, Antigone, and Ismene.\\n\\n- Creon (\\"Kren\\") is a figure in Greek mythology best known as the ruler of Thebes in the legend of Oedipus. He had four sons and three daughters with his wife, Eurydice (sometimes known as Henioche): Henioche, Pyrrha, Megareus (also called Menoeceus), Lycomedes and Haimon. Creon and his sister, Jocasta, were descendants of Cadmus and of the Spartoi. He is sometimes considered to be the same person who purified Amphitryon of the murder of his uncle Electryon and father of Megara, first wife of Heracles. \\n\\n- Ismene (\\"Ismn\\") is the name of the daughter and half-sister of Oedipus, daughter and granddaughter of Jocasta, and sister of Antigone, Eteocles, and Polynices. She appears in several plays of Sophocles: at the end of \\"Oedipus the King\\", in \\"Oedipus at Colonus\\" and in \\"Antigone\\".

Passage 1:Jarrett's career began in South Florida, where he was a successful stage and commercial actor and print model. His first feature film role was in the teen comedy \\"Summer Job\\", where he played an effete hairdresser. Next came minor roles in such films as The Bodyguard with Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston as well as Miami Vice and Unsolved Mysteries. Jarrett also hosted several nationally syndicated television shows, such as \\"Flight,\\" \\"American Automotive,\\" and \\"Better Farming\\" for SportsChannel America, as well as an exercise video with world championship boxer Alexis Arguello called \\"Boxercise.\\" In 1992, Jarrett journeyed to Los Angeles and turned his attention to screenwriting. His original screenplay Laws of Deception was made into a film in 1997 and starred C. Thomas Howell, James Russo and Brian Austin Green and was directed by Joey Travolta, brother of John Travolta. Jarrett had a small role in this film as Mr. Farina, a corrupt businessman. Another original script entitled American Vampire was produced and starred Carmen Electra, Sydney Lassick, and Adam West. It was Carmen Electra's first feature. In 2003, Jarrett appeared as a contestant on the brainy television game show Jeopardy! as Rollin Jewett. In 2004, Jarrett was commissioned by Scott Reeves and Aaron Benward, the popular country music duo known as Blue County, to write a script in which they were to costar as brothers in a fictional place called Blue County. As the duo's music became more popular, the film was postponed and Benward and Reeves used the name for their band, which is still touring today. In 2017, his feature screenplay \\"Demons 4 Dummies\\" was a finalist in the Final Draft Big Break Screenwriting Contest.\\n Passage 2:Walter was born in Kansas City, Missouri, United States, in 1910. His ancestry was German/British on his father's side, and American/British on his mother's side. He was brought to England in 1915, and educated at Westminster School and afterwards in King's College, Cambridge, in 1931. He failed to obtain a research fellowship in Cambridge and so turned to doing basic and applied neurophysiological research in hospitals, in London, from 1935 to 1939 and then at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol, from 1939 to 1970. He also carried out research work in the United States, in the Soviet Union and in various other places in Europe. He married twice, had two sons from his first marriage, and one from the second. According to his eldest son, Nicolas Walter, \\"he was politically on the left, a communist fellow-traveller before the Second World War and an anarchist sympathiser after it.\\" Throughout his life he was a pioneer in the field of cybernetics. In 1970, he suffered a brain injury in a motor scooter accident. He never fully recovered and died seven years later, on May 6, 1977.\\n Passage 3:In response to a downturn in the arcade-game market in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles—starting with the SG-1000 and Master System—but struggled against competing products such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Sega released its next console, the Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside North America) in 1988. Although it initially struggled, the Genesis became a major success after the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991. Sega's marketing strategy, particularly in North America, helped the Genesis outsell main competitor Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System for four consecutive Christmas seasons in the early 1990s.

He was victorious at least once at the City Dionysia , first probably in the mid- 440s ( IG II2 2325 . 56 ; the fourth entry after Teleclides and three poets whose names have been lost , and just before Hermippus ) , and twice at the Lenaia , first probably in the mid- to late 430s ( IG II2 2325 . 122 ; just after Cratinus and just before Hermippus ) . He was especially famous for his inventive imagination , and the elegance and purity of his diction are attested by the epithet  ( most Attic ) applied to him by Athenaeus and the sophist Phrynichus . He was the inventor of a new meter , called after him , the Pherecratean , which frequently occurs in the choruses of Greek tragedies and in Horace . According to an anonymous essay on tragedy , Pherecrates wrote 18 plays , suggesting that one or more of the 19 surviving titles must be eliminated somehow ( i.e. by assigning the play to another author who wrote a comedy by the same name , and assuming an ancient scholarly error , or by identifying e.g. The Human Heracles and The Fake Heracles as a single play with multiple titles ) .\\n\\n- Aristophanes (or  ; c. 446  c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it.\\n\\n- Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes  whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis.\\n\\n- A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.\\n\\n- In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries.\\n\\n- Hermippus (fl. 5th century BC) was the one-eyed Athenian writer of the Old Comedy who flourished during the Peloponnesian War. \\nLife.\\nHe was the son of Lysis, and the brother of the comic poet Myrtilus. He was younger than Telecleides and older than Eupolis and Aristophanes. According to the Suda, he wrote forty plays, and his chief actor was Simeron, according to the scholiast of Aristophanes. The titles and fragments of nine of his plays are preserved. He was a bitter opponent of Pericles, whom he accused (probably in the \\"Moirai\\") of being a bully and a coward, and of carousing with his boon companions while the Lacedaemonians were invading Attica. He also accused Aspasia of impiety and offences against morality, and her acquittal was only secured by the tears of Pericles (Plutarch, \\"Pericles\\", 32). In the \\"Female Bread-Sellers\\", he attacked the demagogue Hyperbolus. The \\"Mat-Carriers\\" contains many parodies of Homer.\\n\\n- Lysistrata (or ; Attic Greek: , \\"Army Disbander\\") is a comedy by Aristophanes. Originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BC, it is a comic account of one woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peacea strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career. It was produced in the same year as the \\"Thesmophoriazusae\\", another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition.\\n\\n- The Clouds (\\"Nephelai\\") is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes. A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens, it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423BC and was not as well-received as the author had hoped, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year. It was revised between 420 and 417BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form.\\n\\n- Ancient Greek comedy was one of the final three principal dramatic forms in the theatre of classical Greece (the others being tragedy and the satyr play). Athenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods: Old Comedy, Middle Comedy, and New Comedy. Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, while Middle Comedy is largely lost, i.e. preserved only in relatively short fragments by authors such as Athenaeus of Naucratis. New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of Menander. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'pherecrates' has the relation 'country of citizenship' with?","target":"classical athens","rationale":"This is the rationale: \\"classical athens\\""},{"source":"Answer this question:\\n\\nwhen did dragon ball z end in america??","target":"1998","rationale":"Dragon Ball Z ended in America in 1998."},{"source":"The input is a conversation between an automated system and a user, followed by a question.

The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him.

Of these, vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, is of particular interest because of its ability to induce neovascularization (angiogenesis). To determine whether VEGF is required for bone repair, we inhibited VEGF activity during secondary bone healing via a cartilage intermediate (endochondral ossification) and during direct bone repair (intramembranous ossification) in a novel mouse model. Treatment of mice with a soluble, neutralizing VEGF receptor decreased angiogenesis, bone formation, and callus mineralization in femoral fractures. Inhibition of VEGF also dramatically inhibited healing of a tibial cortical bone defect, consistent with our discovery of a direct autocrine role for VEGF in osteoblast differentiation. In separate experiments, exogenous VEGF enhanced blood vessel formation, ossification, and new bone (callus) maturation in mouse femur fractures, and promoted bony bridging of a rabbit radius segmental gap defect. Our results at specific time points during the course of healing underscore the role of VEGF in endochondral vs. intramembranous ossification, as well as skeletal development vs. bone repair. The responses to exogenous VEGF observed in two distinct model systems and species indicate that a slow-release formulation of VEGF, applied locally at the site of bone damage, may prove to be an effective therapy to promote human bone repair.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract contains a clear topic sentence that introduces the hypothesis of the study (\\"Several growth factors are expressed in distinct temporal and spatial patterns during fracture repair. Of these, vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, is of particular interest because of its ability to induce neovascularization (angiogenesis). To determine whether VEGF is required for bone repair, we inhibited VEGF activity during secondary bone healing via a cartilage intermediate (endochondral ossification) and during direct bone repair (intramembranous ossification) in a novel mouse model.\\"). The topic sentence is followed by relevant supporting sentences that describe the experimental methods and results. In addition to describing the general rationale behind each experiment, these supporting sentences provide specific data to support each conclusion drawn throughout the abstract.

As a result, although this abstract format provides detailed information about all aspects relevant to this study's findings and conclusions within its three sections (background/introduction/topic sentence section; methods/results section; discussion section), it fails to provide an explicit transition between those three sections as well as a conclusion or summary statement at the end.

If all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time, the referee will begin a count (usually ten seconds, twenty in Japan). If nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count, the match is ruled a draw. Any participant who stands up in time will end the count for everyone else.

In this paper, we set out to answer these questions by studying multiple phase transitions in the IB objective: IB_β[p(z|x)] = I(X; Z) − βI(Y; Z) defined on the encoding distribution p(z|x) for input X, target Y and representation Z, where sudden jumps of dI(Y; Z)/dβ and prediction accuracy are observed with increasing β. We introduce a definition for IB phase transitions as a qualitative change of the IB loss landscape, and show that the transitions correspond to the onset of learning new classes. Using second-order calculus of variations, we derive a formula that provides a practical condition for IB phase transitions, and draw its connection with the Fisher information matrix for parameterized models. We provide two perspectives to understand the formula, revealing that each IB phase transition is finding a component of maximum (nonlinear) correlation between X and Y orthogonal to the learned representation, in close analogy with canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) in linear settings. Based on the theory, we present an algorithm for discovering phase transition points. Finally, we verify that our theory and algorithm accurately predict phase transitions in categorical datasets, predict the onset of learning new classes and class difficulty in MNIST, and predict prominent phase transitions in CIFAR10.","target":"We give a theoretical analysis of the Information Bottleneck objective to understand and predict observed phase transitions in the prediction vs. compression tradeoff","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe give a theoretical analysis of the Information Bottleneck objective to understand and predict observed phase transitions in the prediction vs. compression tradeoff."},{"source":"Multi-select: Is it possible to draw the conclusion that \\"Since Jade always has good luck, Alice spotted her quickly.\\" if \\"Alice looked for her friend Jade in the crowd.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population.

He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844.\\nIn Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict.\\nIn 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

I wasn’t super happy about it, but I put up with it because I know that she has been there for me when I was sick.\\n\\nNow, whenever my dad or me gets sick, we take a range of different medicine regularly to try to fight it off ranging from DayQuill/NyQuill, to zinc tablets (which have been clinically shown to shorten colds), to Dimetapp at night. Apart from that, we drink lots of liquids.\\n\\nSo as I’ve been taking care of her, I suggest that she takes some medicine, but she rarely would take anything except for Advil, which lowers her fever I guess. To top that, she would drink barely any fluids (like maybe 10-12 oz per day). All of this made me mad, but I didn’t try to push it too hard on her.\\n\\nToday however (basically a couple of weeks since she first started feeling symptoms), I woke up and felt really sick. I went to my mom (still sick btw) and told her that I was a bit mad at her for getting me sick because she didn’t try to take any medicine to shorten her cold. She told me that she’s sorry I got sick and that, yes, it’s probably from her, but that she doesn’t think the medicine has any correlation.\\n\\nObviously there are no guarantees with something like this, and I could have gotten sick from her even if she had been taking medicine, but I still feel like she’s to blame for not really attempting to fight the sickness at all.

Moving in vignettes from her early years when Earhart was captivated by the sight of an aircraft flying overhead on the Kansas prairie where she grew up, her life over the preceding decade gradually unfolds. As a young woman, she is recruited by publishing tycoon and eventual husband, George Putnam (Richard Gere) to become the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean, albeit as a passenger. Taking command of the flight results in a success and she is thrust into the limelight as the most famous woman pilot of her time. Putnam helps Earhart write a book chronicling the flight, much like his earlier triumph with Charles Lindbergh's We. Earhart gradually falls in love with Putnam and they eventually marry, although she enacts a \\"cruel\\" pledge as her wedding contract.\\nEmbarrassed that her fame was not earned, Earhart commences to set myriad aviation records, and in 1932, recreates her earlier transatlantic flight, becoming the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic. Throughout a decade of notoriety, Earhart falls into an awkward love affair with pilot and future Federal Aviation administrator Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor). In a display of romantic jealousy, Putnam quietly tells Amelia that he does not want Vidal in his house. Earhart is annoyed by the seemingly endless agenda of celebrity appearances and endorsements but Putnam reminds his wife that it funds her flying. Earhart returns to her husband on the eve of her last momentous flight. Earhart's last flight was her biggest and most dangerous adventure to date. Her plan was to fly around the world. Earhart's first attempt ends in a runway crash in Hawaii, due to a collapsed landing gear, and her aircraft requires extensive repairs before the flight can be attempted again. Eventually, she takes the repaired Lockheed Model 10 Electra, sponsored by Purdue University, in a reverse direction, leaving the lengthy trans-Pacific crossing at the end of her flight.\\nSetting out to refuel at tiny Howland Island, radio transmissions between USCGC Itasca, a Coast Guard picket ship, and Earhart's aircraft reveal a rising crisis. Earhart radios to Itasca that the sky has become cloudy and overcast. When Itasca attempts to radio her back, however, all Earhart gets is static. For the rest of the approach, Earhart cannot hear Itasca's transmissions, although they can hear hers. The Coast Guard radio operators realize that they do not have sufficient length to provide a \\"fix\\". Itasca has a directional finder with a dead battery, and weak radio communications prevent Earhart and USCG Itasca from making contact. Running low on fuel, Earhart and Noonan continue to fly on over empty ocean, as Earhart informs the Itasca that she is on position line 157-337, running north and south. She is not heard from again.

However, (Bu)2cAMP alone did not induce differentiation of type A spermatogonia. Moreover, when cryptorchid testes were treated with (Bu)2cAMP for longer than 3 days in the presence or absence of retinol, differentiation of type A spermatogonia did not take place; disintegration of the seminiferous tubules occurred instead. When the cryptorchid testes were cultured for 24 h in a medium containing a fixed concentration of retinol and varying concentrations of (Bu)2cAMP from 0.001-0.4 mM, there was a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells and type A spermatogonia. Likewise, at a fixed dose of (Bu)2cAMP and increasing concentrations of retinol, a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells occurred. However, the number of type A spermatogonia was decreased. The addition of puromycin, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D to the medium completely blocked retinol-(Bu)2cAMP-induced differentiation of the germ cells.

So then we have an area where the river slows down considerably going from rock to sand but speed doesn't change much being on either one alone .\\nSo here's how I'm thinking about it:\\n- If they're both areas where things could be slowed down by"},{"source":"In this task, you're given four sentences of a story written in natural language.

There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.\\n\\nand the situation: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature.\\n\\nAnswer the following question: Which P.D. took a less efficient approach in fighting crime?","target":"Greenville","rationale":"The introduction states: \\"It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases.\\"\\nThis means that more efficient crime fighting methods are those that do NOT invest in DNA testing or information technology.

They warned that clinicians carrying out such classifications must be aware of their severe limitations, and make sure prisoners undergo comprehensive psychiatric diagnosis before any risks assessment is made. “If you apply these (tests) to somebody who is a psychopath, they’re utterly useless, you might as well toss a coin,” said Jeremy Coid, director of the forensic psychiatry research unit at Queen Mary University of London who led the study. “They will not predict accurately at all,” he told reporters at a briefing in London about his findings. Coid and other forensic psychiatrists say the findings - which also showed the tools perform only moderately well in prisoners with disorders like schizophrenia, depression, drug and alcohol dependence - could have major implications for risk assessment in criminal justice systems. “There are increasing expectations of public protection from violent behavior, and psychiatrists can be seriously criticized if they make wrong decisions,” he said. Seena Fazel, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at Britain’s University of Oxford, said the reliability of the tests’ predictive ability was so low that it might be best not to use them at all - and warned that at the very least, their results should only be noted by parole boards, rather than acted upon. “If you’re going to use these instruments, be aware of their strengths and limitations,” he told reporters. The estimated prevalence of adult psychopathy in the general population is around 1 percent, but that rises to between 15 percent and 25 percent among men in prison. Coid, whose study was published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, analyzed data from 1,396 male prisoners in England and Wales who were interviewed between six and 12 months before their release. All the men were serving sentences of two or more years for a sexual or violent offences. The prisoners were assessed for personality disorders, symptoms of schizophrenia, depression and drug and alcohol dependence, as well as being measured for psychopathy on a reputable scale known as Hare Psychopathy Check List. After their release, data on their re-offending rates was added to the study, and showed that among three different re-offending risk assessment tools used before their release, the accuracy among psychopaths was below 50 percent. While the tools were more accurate in predictions for prisoners with no mental health disorders - at around 75 percent accuracy - they were only around 60 percent right when it came to prisoners diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. For prisoners with anti-social personality disorders the predictive value of the tests ranged from poor to little more than chance, with an average 53.2 percent predictive accuracy. And for the 70 prisoners rated as psychopathic, none of the tests was statistically better than chance. Coid said the results suggest it is time to question the expectations put on psychiatrists and psychologists asked to forecast future behavior of offenders, and to consider what can happen to their reputations if predictions are wrong. “The easy solution is to be highly restrictive on who is released, and be risk averse. However, even for serious offenders, most will be released at some stage and someone has to carry out a risk assessment,” he said. “We need to prioritize the development of new assessment tools for these hard-to-predict groups.” Claim: Predicting violence in psychopaths is 'no more than chance'.","target":"2","rationale":"The claim is \\"Predicting violence in psychopaths is 'no more than chance'\\". The paragraph includes the following sentences: \\"They warned that clinicians carrying out such classifications must be aware of their severe limitations, and make sure prisoners undergo comprehensive psychiatric diagnosis before any risks assessment is made.\\". This suggests that risk score tools are not very accurate at predicting violence in psychopaths.

In the hypokalemia group, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (5 g/kg body weight) was infused into the colon. In both groups, the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium were measured every 15 minutes for 60 minutes. The mean (+/- standard deviation) serum potassium level of the hypokalemia group decreased significantly from 3.81 +/- 0.21 to 2.92 +/- 0.36 mEq/liter; there were no significant changes in other electrolytes. After 60 minutes, epinephrine (10 micrograms/kg) was injected intravenously in the hypokalemia and control groups, and the arrhythmia ratio (the number of ventricular ectopic beats divided by the total heart rate) was calculated for 5 minutes. Each group was further classified into subgroups of dogs with an arrhythmia ratio higher or lower than 10%. An arrhythmia ratio over 10% was observed in 7.7% of the control group and 53% of the hypokalemia group. Immediately after 5 minutes of epinephrine injection, myocardial mitochondria and plasma membrane fraction were prepared from each group. Mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity of plasma membrane fraction were determined.

He was the first Adigar (a role which combined the powers of a prime minister and a chief justice) from 1811 to 1814 under the reign King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. He was appointed by the king as the Disawe (local governor) of Sabaragamuva. In 1814 when the king believed he failed to suppress an uprising in Sabaragamuva he sent his forces to capture Ehelepola, who fled from Ratnapura to the British-occupied port of Kalutara. The king retaliated by brutally executing his wife, Kumarihamy and his four children, Loku Bandara, Madduma Bandara, Tikiri Manike and Dingiri Menike. Ehelepola then aided the British in launching an invasion of the Kingdom of Kandy and was instrumental in the Kandyan Convention that followed in March 1815, which led to the annexing of Kingdom of Kandy as part of the British Empire.

The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several NuBus expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud. One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty.

Somewhat confusingly, this includes both phosphorescent materials, which show a slow decay in brightness (> 1 ms), and fluorescent materials, where the emission decay takes place over tens of nanoseconds. Phosphorescent materials are known for their use in radar screens and glow-in-the-dark materials, whereas fluorescent materials are common in cathode ray tube (CRT) and plasma video display screens, sensors, and white LEDs.\\n\\n- An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.\\n\\n- A phytase ( myo - inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydrolase ) is any type of phosphatase enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phytic acid ( myo - inositol hexakisphosphate ) -- an indigestible , organic form of phosphorus that is found in grains and oil seeds -- and releases a usable form of inorganic phosphorus . While phytases have been found to occur in animals , plants , fungi and bacteria , phytases have been most commonly detected and characterized from fungi .\\n\\n- The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells.\\n\\n- Alkaline phosphatase (ALP, ALKP, ALPase, Alk Phos) is a hydrolase enzyme responsible for removing phosphate groups from many types of molecules, including nucleotides, proteins, and alkaloids. The process of removing the phosphate group is called \\"dephosphorylation\\". As the name suggests, alkaline phosphatases are most effective in an alkaline environment; it is sometimes used synonymously as basic phosphatase.\\n\\n- Dephosphorylation is the removal of a phosphate (PO) group from an organic compound by hydrolysis. It is a reversible post-translational modification. Dephosphorylation and its counterpart, phosphorylation, activate and deactivate enzymes by detaching or attaching phosphoric esters and anhydrides. A notable occurrence of dephosphorylation is the conversion of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate.\\n\\n- In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.\\n\\n- A phosphatase is an enzyme that removes a phosphate group from its substrate by hydrolysing phosphoric acid monoesters into a phosphate ion and a molecule with a free hydroxyl group (see dephosphorylation). This action is directly opposite to that of phosphorylases and kinases, which attach phosphate groups to their substrates by using energetic molecules like ATP. A common phosphatase in many organisms is alkaline phosphatase. Another large group of proteins present in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryote exhibits deoxyribonucleotide and ribonucleotide phosphatase or pyrophosphatase activities that catalyse the decomposition of dNTP/NTP into dNDP/NDP and a free phosphate ion or dNMP/NMP and a free pyrophosphate ion. \\nThe other group of phosphatase is collectively called as protein phosphatase, which removes a phosphate group from the phosphorylated amino acid residue of the substrate protein. Protein phosphorylation is a common posttranslational modification of protein catalyzed by protein kinases, and protein phosphatases reverse the effect.\\n\\n- A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- In biochemistry, a kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates. This process is known as phosphorylation, where the substrate gains a phosphate group and the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group. This transesterification produces a phosphorylated substrate and ADP. Conversely, it is referred to as dephosphorylation when the phosphorylated substrate donates a phosphate group and ADP gains a phosphate group (producing a dephosphorylated substrate and the high energy molecule of ATP). These two processes, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, occur four times during glycolysis. Kinases are part of the larger family of phosphotransferases. Kinases are not to be confused with phosphorylases, which catalyze the addition of inorganic phosphate groups to an acceptor, nor with phosphatases, which remove phosphate groups. The phosphorylation state of a molecule, whether it be a protein, lipid, or carbohydrate, can affect its activity, reactivity, and its ability to bind other molecules. Therefore, kinases are critical in metabolism, cell signalling, protein regulation, cellular transport, secretory processes, and many other cellular pathways.\\n\\n- Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\".\\n\\n- Phosphoric acid (also known as orthophosphoric acid or phosphoric(V) acid) is a mineral (inorganic) acid having the chemical formula HPO. Orthophosphoric acid refers to \\"phosphoric acid\\", which is the IUPAC name for this compound. The prefix \\"ortho\\" is used to distinguish the acid from related phosphoric acids, called polyphosphoric acids. Orthophosphoric acid is a non-toxic acid, which, when pure, is a solid at room temperature and pressure. The conjugate base of phosphoric acid is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, , which in turn has a conjugate base of hydrogen phosphate, , which has a conjugate base of phosphate, . Phosphates are nutritious for all forms of life.\\n\\n- Decomposition is the process by which organic substances are broken down into simpler matter. The process is is a part of nutrient cycle and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biome. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death. Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials. Organisms that do this are known as decomposers. Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition. The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as \\"taphonomy\\" from the Greek word  \\"taphos\\", meaning tomb.\\n\\n- In chemistry, esters are chemical compounds derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an Oalkyl (alkoxy) group. Usually, esters are derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Glycerides, which are fatty acid esters of glycerol, are important esters in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids, and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in essential oils and pheromones. Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules. Nitrate esters, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties, while polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties.\\n\\n- GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems.\\n\\n- Inositol or cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol is a chemical compound with formula or (-CHOH-), a six-fold alcohol (polyol) of cyclohexane. It exists in nine possible stereoisomers, of which the most prominent form, widely occurring in nature, is cis\\"-1,2,3,5-\\"trans\\"-4,6-cyclohexanehexol, or myo\\"-inositol (former names meso-inositol or i-inositol). Inositol is a sugar alcohol. Its taste has been assayed at half the sweetness of table sugar (sucrose).\\n\\n- A phosphate is an inorganic chemical and a salt of phosphoric acid. In organic chemistry, a phosphate, or organophosphate, is an ester of phosphoric acid. Of the various phosphoric acids and phosphates, organic phosphates are important in biochemistry and biogeochemistry (ecology), and inorganic phosphates are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry. At elevated temperatures in the solid state, phosphates can condense to form pyrophosphates.\\n\\n- A deoxyribonucleotide is the monomer, or single unit, of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. Each deoxyribonucleotide comprises three parts: a nitrogenous base, a deoxyribose sugar, and one phosphate group. The nitrogenous base is always bonded to the 1' carbon of the deoxyribose, which is distinguished from ribose by the presence of a proton on the 2' carbon rather than an -OH group. The phosphate groups bind to the 5' carbon of the sugar.\\n\\n- A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy.\\n\\n- Phosphorus is a chemical element with symbol P and atomic number 15. As an element, phosphorus exists in two major formswhite phosphorus and red phosphorusbut because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. At 0.099%, phosphorus is the most abundant pnictogen in the Earth's crust. With few exceptions, minerals containing phosphorus are in the maximally oxidised state as inorganic phosphate rocks.\\n\\n- Phosphorylases are enzymes that catalyze the addition of a phosphate group from an inorganic phosphate (phosphate+hydrogen) to an acceptor.\\nThey include allosteric enzymes that catalyze the production of glucose-1-phosphate from a glucan such as glycogen, starch or maltodextrin. Phosphorylase is also a common name used for glycogen phosphorylase in honor of Earl W. Sutherland Jr. who in the late 1930s discovered the first phosphorylase.\\n\\n- A eukaryote (or or ) is any organism whose cells contain a nucleus and other organelles enclosed within membranes.\\nEukaryotes belong to the taxon Eukarya or Eukaryota. The defining feature that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea) is that they have membrane-bound organelles, especially the nucleus, which contains the genetic material and is enclosed by the nuclear envelope. The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name, which comes from the Greek  (\\"eu\\", \\"well\\" or \\"true\\") and  (\\"karyon\\", \\"nut\\" or \\"kernel\\"). Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. In addition, plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Eukaryotic organisms may be unicellular or multicellular. Only eukaryotes form multicellular organisms consisting of many kinds of tissue made up of different cell types.\\n\\n- Bran, also known as miller's bran, is the hard outer layers of cereal grain. It consists of the combined aleurone and pericarp.\\n\\n- Phytic acid (known as inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), inositol polyphosphate, or phytate when in salt form), discovered in 1903, a saturated cyclic acid, is the principal storage form of phosphorus in many plant tissues, especially bran and seeds. It can be found in cereals and grains.\\n\\n- A pnictogen is one of the chemical elements in group 15 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the nitrogen family. It consists of the elements nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), and perhaps also the chemically uncharacterized synthetic element moscovium (Mc).\\n\\n- Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.\\n\\n- Table salt or common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater, where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about of solids per litre, a salinity of 3.5%.\\n\\n- A protein kinase is a kinase enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them (phosphorylation). Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein (substrate) by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins. The human genome contains about 500 protein kinase genes and they constitute about 2% of all human genes. Up to 30% of all human proteins may be modified by kinase activity, and kinases are known to regulate the majority of cellular pathways, especially those involved in signal transduction. Protein kinases are also found in bacteria and plants.\\n\\n- SEED is a block cipher developed by the Korea Information Security Agency (KISA). It is used broadly throughout South Korean industry, but seldom found elsewhere. It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit encryption was not considered strong enough, so the Korea Information Security Agency developed its own standard. However, this decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in Korea, as no major SSL libraries or web browsers supported the SEED algorithm, requiring users to use an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer for secure web sites.\\n\\n- A protein phosphatase is an enzyme that removes a phosphate group from the phosphorylated amino acid residue of its substrate protein. Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common forms of reversible protein posttranslational modification (PTM), with up to 30% of all proteins being phosphorylated at any given time. Protein kinases (PKs) are the effectors of phosphorylation and catalyse the transfer of a -phosphate from ATP to specific amino acids on proteins. Several hundred PKs exist in mammals and are classified into distinct super-families. Proteins are phosphorylated predominantly on Ser, Thr and Tyr residues, which account for 79.3, 16.9 and 3.8% respectively of the phosphoproteome, at least in mammals. In contrast, protein phosphatases (PPs) are the primary effectors of dephosphorylation and can be grouped into three main classes based on sequence, structure and catalytic function. The largest class of PPs is the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family comprising PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP4, PP5, PP6 and PP7, and the protein phosphatase Mg- or Mn-dependent (PPM) family, composed primarily of PP2C. The protein Tyr phosphatase (PTP) super-family forms the second group, and the aspartate-based protein phosphatases the third.\\n\\n- In biochemistry, a ribonucleotide or ribotide is a nucleotide containing ribose as its pentose component. It is considered a molecular precursor of nucleic acids. Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA. The monomer itself from ribonucleotides forms the basic building blocks for RNA. However, the reduction of ribonucleotide, by enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), forms deoxyribonucleotide, which is the essential building block for DNA. There are several differences between DNA deoxyribonucleotides and RNA ribonucleotides. Successive nucleotides are linked together via phosphodiester bonds by 3'-5'.\\n\\n\\n\\n'phytase' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'has part'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1\\n - 1903\\n - a\\n - algae\\n - algorithm\\n - atom\\n - base\\n - bran\\n - carbon\\n - cell\\n - cereal\\n - chemical element\\n - chemistry\\n - dna\\n - earth\\n - element\\n - family\\n - glucose\\n - group\\n - human\\n - hydrogen\\n - i\\n - information security\\n - iron\\n - length\\n - lipid\\n - matter\\n - nitrogen\\n - nitroglycerin\\n - nut\\n - o\\n - organism\\n - ortho\\n - outer\\n - oxygen\\n - part\\n - periodic table\\n - phosphorus\\n - protein\\n - proton\\n - room\\n - s\\n - salt\\n - second\\n - set\\n - signal\\n - sodium chloride\\n - solid\\n - space\\n - sucrose\\n - temperature\\n - third\\n - v\\n - video\\n - w","target":"carbon","rationale":"The relation between 'phytase' and 'carbon' is that: phytases contain carbon."},{"source":"In this task, you are given an utterance, which is a part of a conversation between a user and an agent.

While it is a literal reflection of the king and queen, Snyder writes \\"it is the image of exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character\\"  Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that Velázquez's portrait is \\"the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princess—a mirror of the princess\\". The painting is likely to have been influenced by Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, of 1434. At the time, van Eyck's painting hung in Philip's palace, and would have been familiar to Velázquez. The Arnolfini Portrait also has a mirror positioned at the back of the pictorial space, reflecting two figures who would have the same angle of vision as does the viewer of Velázquez's painting; they are too small to identify, but it has been speculated that one may be intended as the artist himself, though he is not shown in the act of painting. According to Lucien Dällenbach:\\nThe mirror [in Las Meninas] faces the observer as in Van Eyck's painting. But here the procedure is more realistic to the degree that the \\"rearview\\" mirror in which the royal couple appears is no longer convex but flat. Whereas the reflection in the Flemish painting recomposed objects and characters within a space that is condensed and deformed by the curve of the mirror, that of Velázquez refuses to play with the laws of perspective: it projects onto the canvas the perfect double of the king and queen positioned in front of the painting. Moreover, in showing the figures whom the painter observes, and also, through the mediation of the mirror, the figures who are observing him, the painter achieves a reciprocity of gazes that makes the interior oscillate with the exterior and which causes the image to \\"emerge from its frame\\" at the same time that it invites the visitors to enter...\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the name of the painting that is a a reflection of ideal character?","target":"Las Meninas","rationale":"The name of the painting that is a \\"a reflection of ideal character\\" is Las Meninas."},{"source":"Based on the following passage, does cocoa butter have coconut oil in it?

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans.

This leads to a poor performance on old tasks – a phenomenon framed as catastrophic forgetting.   While early approaches use task rehearsal and growing networks that both limit the scalability of the task sequence orthogonal approaches build on regularization.   Based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) changes to parameters that are relevant to old tasks are penalized, which forces the task to be mapped into the available remaining capacity of the network. This requires to calculate the Hessian around a mode, which makes learning tractable. In this paper, we introduce Hessian-free curvature estimates as an alternative method to actually calculating the Hessian.   In contrast to previous work, we exploit the fact that most regions in the loss surface are flat and hence only calculate a Hessian-vector-product around the surface that is relevant for the current task.

It contained the following species : Papyrus yellow warbler ( Chloropeta gracilirostris ) African yellow warbler ( Chloropeta natalensis ) Mountain yellow warbler ( Chloropeta similis )\\n\\n- Tree warblers are medium-sized warblers in the marsh- and tree-warbler family Acrocephalidae. They are found in Europe, Africa and western Asia. Until recently, they were all classified in the single genus \\"Hippolais\\".\\n\\n- There are a number of Passeriformes (perching birds) called warblers. They are not necessarily closely related to one another, but share some characteristics, such as being fairly small, vocal, and insectivorous.\\n\\n- Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean.

Kenya covers , and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014.\\n\\n- The Sylvioidea are a clade of passerine birds, one of at least three major clades within the Passerida along with the Muscicapoidea and Passeroidea. It contains about 1300 species including the Old World warblers, Old World babblers, swallows, larks, bulbuls, and perhaps the tits. Members of the clade are found worldwide, but fewer species are present in the Americas.\\n\\n- The Democratic Republic of the Congo , also known as DR Congo, DRC, DROC, East Congo, Congo-Kinshasa, or simply the Congo is a country located in Central Africa. From 1971 to 1997 it was named, and is sometimes still called Zaire, and from 1908 to 1960 it was called the Belgian Congo. The DRC borders the Central African Republic, and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania to the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest.

The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.\\n\\n- Old World warblers are a large group of birds formerly grouped together in the bird family Sylviidae. The family held over 400 species in over 70 genera, and were the source of much taxonomic confusion. Two families were split out initially, the cisticolas into Cisticolidae and the kinglets into Regulidae. In the past ten years they have been the subject of much research and many species are now placed into other families, including the Acrocephalidae, Cettiidae, Phylloscopidae, and Megaluridae. In addition some species have been moved into existing families or have not yet had their placement fully resolved. A smaller family of warblers, together with some babblers formerly placed in the family Timaliidae and the parrotbills, are retained in a much smaller family Sylviidae.\\n\\n- The Republic of Zambia is a landlocked country in Southern Africa, neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to the south, and Angola to the west.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about $10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

In the 1930s the LPO had flourished, but since Beecham's departure in 1940, it had struggled to survive. Boult was well known to the orchestra, having been among the musicians who came to its aid in 1940. He took over as chief conductor of the LPO in June 1950, immediately after leaving the BBC, and threw himself into the task of rebuilding it. In the early years of his conductorship, the finances of the LPO were perilous, and Boult subsidised the orchestra from his own funds for some time. The need to earn money obliged the orchestra to play many more concerts than its rivals. In the 1949–50 season, the LPO gave 248 concerts, compared with 55 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra, and 32 apiece by the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic orchestras.\\nAlthough he had worked extensively in the studio for the BBC, Boult had, up to this point, recorded only a part of his large repertoire for the gramophone.  With the LPO he began a series of commercial recordings that continued at a varying rate for the rest of his working life. Their first recordings together were Elgar's Falstaff, Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen with the mezzo Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven's First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by the reviewers. Of the Elgar, The Gramophone wrote, \\"I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult's] performance. ...

A left total hip arthroplasty was performed in forty dogs. Thirty of the dogs had a titanium-alloy femoral prosthesis that had had one of three types of commercially pure titanium porous material applied along the length of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stem: ten with sintered fiber-metal, ten with sintered beads, and ten with plasma flame-spray coating. The remaining ten dogs had a femoral component that was circumferentially coated with commercially pure titanium that was plasma flame-sprayed along the length of the stem. In each group, five animals were killed at one month and five were killed at six months. Ingrowth of bone into all three types of porous coating was observed, indicating secure fixation of all components. By six months, there was more ingrowth of bone and new medullary bone adjacent to the proximal and distal aspects of the stems compared with the middle level of the stems in all groups. No significant difference in ingrowth of bone was observed in the beaded surface (25.2 per cent) and the fiber-metal surface (16.6 per cent) at one month, but at six months there was significantly less ingrowth into the beaded surface (23.3 per cent) than into the fiber-metal surface (37.3 per cent). In all groups, a proximal-to-distal gradient of loss of cortical bone was observed by six months. The group of dogs that had the stem with the circumferential coating experienced more severe loss of bone than did the three groups that had a stem with a partial coating.

The samples were subjected to multiple exposure photography (four picture frames of two different drops) at 0, 1, 4, or 5 and at 10 hours and sperm motility and velocity were analyzed. In both calcium and calcium-creatine phosphate conditions, sperm motility and velocity were significantly increased, compared with control values (P = between less than 0.001 and 0.05). Sperm motility declined following Verapamil exposure, but the motility values remained at the level of the control in the presence of additional calcium or creatine phosphate. The effects of calcium and creatine phosphate take place rapidly; within 1 minute all improvements in sperm velocity and motility are fully achieved. There is no loading effect of calcium, and when the sperm is transferred into media without the additional calcium, the velocity decreased to that of the initial control value. Magnesium alone had no effect on motility or velocity. These experiments indicate that calcium or creatine phosphate can support sperm motility and velocity at a significantly increased level. Thus the addition of calcium or creatine phosphate to the insemination media may enhance the fertilizing capacity of sperm during in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures.","target":"Enhancement of human sperm motility and velocity in vitro: effects of calcium and creatine phosphate","rationale":"The abstract describes how calcium and creatine phosphate enhance the fertilizing capacity of sperm during in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures.

It is assembled around arrays of ribosomal DNA genes, forming specific chromosomal features known as nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) which are the sites of ribosomal DNA transcription. While the nucleolus main activity involve different steps of ribosome biogenesis, the presence of proteins with no obvious relationship with ribosome subunit production suggests additional functions for the nucleolus, such as regulation of mitosis, cell cycle progression, stress response and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein complexes. The many novel factors and separate classes of proteins identified within the nucleolus support this view that the nucleolus may perform additional functions beyond its known role in ribosome subunit biogenesis.

The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states.

Gwen Moore of Wisconsin declared in a May 4, 2017 news release, \\"\\"being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault could be considered pre-existing conditions.\\"\\" The claim by Moore, who has talked publicly about being a victim of domestic violence and sexual assault herself, cuts to one of the big fears around health care -- that having something that is considered a pre-existing condition means a person has to pay more for insurance, or could be denied coverage altogether. Typically, this refers to things such as diabetes or cancer. But sexual assault or domestic violence? Obamacare vs ‘Trumpcare’ The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is the 2010 legislation adopted under President Barack Obama. It prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage -- or charging higher premiums -- because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Under the American Health Care Act (sometimes called \\"\\"Trumpcare\\"\\"), insurers would still be prohibited from denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition. The bill was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives and could be changed in the Senate. But in its current form, the bill would give states the option to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions higher prices. Republicans argue those people would be protected, because those states would have to set up high-risk pools to insure people with pre-existing conditions. But many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable. (The day after the House passed the bill, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said he would consider allowing insurers to charge higher prices. But later that day -- in an indication of how politically touchy the issue is -- he backed away from that comment after it drew criticism.) Pre-existing conditions Bloggers claimed that under the GOP bill, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition, which PolitiFact National rated . PolitiFact National spelled out what would happen under the GOP bill regarding sexual assault and experts told us that the same would apply to domestic violence. In a nutshell: The bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable. Our rating Moore says that \\"\\"under ‘Trumpcare,’\\"\\" the Republican replacement for Obamacare, domestic violence and sexual assault \\"\\"could be considered pre-existing conditions\\"\\" -- something that could trigger higher insurance prices for those victims. Moore’s claim goes too far. Simply being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault would not mean a person had a pre-existing condition. But it is important to know that conditions stemming from those assaults, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, could. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is .\\" Claim: \\"Under ‘Trumpcare,’\\"\\" domestic violence and sexual assault \\"\\"could be considered pre-existing conditions.\\"","target":"0","rationale":"In the paragraph, it is stated that victims of domestic violence or sexual assault will not be considered to have a pre-existing condition.

Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR Marty Booker.  In the second quarter, Harrington acquired the only score of the period on a 5-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael.  In the third quarter, kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 42-yard field goal, while Harrington and Booker connected with each other again on a 19-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, Mare managed to put the game away with a 28-yard field goal. RB Ronnie Brown only had 68 yards rushing (with 5 yards receiving), as he left the game early with a broken left hand. He is currently week-to-week and will likely miss the team's next game against Jacksonville. With the Dolphins victory, not only did the Dolphins improve to 5-6, but Harrington also got his second-ever Thanksgiving Day victory and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd touchdown pass ever on Thanksgiving Day.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"Which quarterback threw for the second touchdown of the game?","rationale":"Here's a question for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Which quarterback threw for the second touchdown of the game?"},{"source":"and it 's working pretty good . maybe i can change all around , i do feel like it 's working . probably the endorphins and health helping too .\\nWhat is helping with your health ?\\nPick the best answer from the following options:\\nA.

Muscles atrophy when they are not used, and over time if atrophy is prolonged, muscle cells die. It is therefore important that those who are susceptible to muscle atrophy exercise to maintain muscle function and prevent the complete loss of muscle tissue. In extreme cases, when movement is not possible, electrical stimulation can be introduced to a muscle from an external source. This acts as a substitute for endogenous neural stimulation, stimulating the muscle to contract and preventing the loss of proteins that occurs with a lack of use. Physiotherapists work with patients to maintain muscles. They are trained to target muscles susceptible to atrophy, and to prescribe and monitor exercises designed to stimulate those muscles. There are various causes of atrophy, including mechanical injury, disease, and age. After breaking a limb or undergoing surgery, muscle use is impaired and can lead to disuse atrophy. If the muscles are not exercised, this atrophy can lead to long-term muscle weakness. A stroke can also cause muscle impairment by interrupting neural stimulation to certain muscles. Without neural inputs, these muscles do not contract and thus begin to lose structural proteins. Exercising these muscles can help to restore muscle function and minimize functional impairments. Age-related muscle loss is also a target of physical therapy, as exercise can reduce the effects of age-related atrophy and improve muscle function. The goal of a physiotherapist is to improve physical functioning and reduce functional impairments; this is achieved by understanding the cause of muscle impairment and assessing the capabilities of a patient, after which a program to enhance these capabilities is designed. Some factors that are assessed include strength, balance, and endurance, which are continually monitored as exercises are...\\n\\n\\nQ: What kinds of cells that are important to our physical functioning can atrophy when they are not used?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"muscles","rationale":"The first paragraph of the quoted passage states that \\"muscle cells die when they are not regenerated but instead replaced by connective tissue and adipose tissue, which do not possess the contractile abilities of muscle tissues.\\" This suggests that muscles atrophy when they are not used.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

Passage:Unlike other parts of Bangalore where Cricket is popular, Football is a passion for the residents of Austin Town. According to football coach Thyagarajan, Austin Town is considered the birthplace of Football in Bangalore. The origins of the game can be traced to the Italian soldiers who were being held as prisoners of war during the beginning of WWI in the Bangalore Cantonment. The Italian POWs passed on the game to the natives, even though at first the natives played football bare-footed. (Some players played without boots even in the Olympics.) The very first Olympians – Anthony, Kanniah, Raman and Shanmugham – who represented the Indian Football team in the Olympic Games of 1948 and 1952, were from Austin Town. Vajravelu and Varadarajan were from the City area, and the rest of the players were from the Bangalore Cantonment. Most of the Football enthusiasts in Austin Town are the Tamil Community, with many of the local boys now playing for clubs in Goa and Calcutta. In the 1960s and 1970s, many of the Austin Town boys made it the Football teams of Government and defence companies such as HMT, MEG, ITI, NGEF, HAL, BEML, BHEL, ADA, ADE, etc. Austin Town and Murphy Town are still considered gold-mines of football talent. One of Austin Town's legend and local hero is 95-year-old T Shanmugham, who led India to victory in Football in the 1951 Asian Games, and also was part of India's Football team for the 1952 Olympics. The Austin Town Football Grounds is now known as Nandan Ground's after one of Indian Football's greatest goalkeeper Nandan, who was also from Austin Town. Austin Town is also the birthplace of other legendary football players such as Ulaganathan and former Captain Carlton Chapman.\\n Links: a. Bangalore Cantonment b. Narayanswami Ulaganathan c.

In the 1930s the LPO had flourished, but since Beecham's departure in 1940, it had struggled to survive. Boult was well known to the orchestra, having been among the musicians who came to its aid in 1940. He took over as chief conductor of the LPO in June 1950, immediately after leaving the BBC, and threw himself into the task of rebuilding it. In the early years of his conductorship, the finances of the LPO were perilous, and Boult subsidised the orchestra from his own funds for some time. The need to earn money obliged the orchestra to play many more concerts than its rivals. In the 1949–50 season, the LPO gave 248 concerts, compared with 55 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra, and 32 apiece by the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic orchestras.\\nAlthough he had worked extensively in the studio for the BBC, Boult had, up to this point, recorded only a part of his large repertoire for the gramophone.  With the LPO he began a series of commercial recordings that continued at a varying rate for the rest of his working life. Their first recordings together were Elgar's Falstaff, Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen with the mezzo Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven's First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by the reviewers. Of the Elgar, The Gramophone wrote, \\"I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult's] performance. ... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably\\". In The Manchester Guardian, Neville Cardus wrote, \\"Nobody is better able than Sir Adrian Boult to expound the subtly mingled contents of this master work.\\"In January 1951 Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Kennedy as \\"gruelling\\", with 12 concerts on 12 successive days.

RNA expression was analysed using Northern blot analysis. DNA synthesis of human vascular SMCs was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-galectin-1 fusion protein (Gal FP) binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins was measured by ELISA. Gal-1 binding to cells and ECM was estimated using 125I-labelled Gal FP.', 'Prominent Gal-1 staining coincided with SMC proliferation in human coronary endarterectomy samples in organoid culture. In cell culture, Gal-1 mRNA was upregulated in growing SMCs. Gal FP increased serum-induced DNA synthesis of human SMCs on plastic or endogenous ECM, but not of a rat PAC1 SM cell line. Also, Gal FP slightly increased SMC adhesion to ECM. SMCs exhibited a complex pattern of receptor-ligand interactions with Gal FP.

With the use of GPs as building blocks for ever more sophisticated Bayesian deep learning models, removing these impediments is a necessary step for achieving large scale results. We present a variational approximation for a wide range of GP models that does not require a matrix inverse to be performed at each optimisation step. Our bound instead directly parameterises a free matrix, which is an additional variational parameter. At the local maxima of the bound, this matrix is equal to the matrix inverse. We prove that our bound gives the same guarantees as earlier variational approximations. We demonstrate some beneficial properties of the bound experimentally, although significant wall clock time speed improvements will require future improvements in optimisation and implementation.","target":"We present a variational lower bound for GP models that can be optimised without computing expensive matrix operations like inverses, while providing the same guarantees as existing variational approximations","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe present a variational lower bound for GP models that can be optimised without computing expensive matrix operations like inverses, while providing the same guarantees as existing variational approximations."},{"source":"If you eat a lot of chicken your body has what it needs to\\n- tell the weather\\n- fix wounds\\n- grow feathers\\n- fly\\n\\nWhich is the correct answer?","target":"fix wounds","rationale":"The question is asking which option is the correct answer.

Walpole chaired cabinet meetings, appointed all the other ministers, dispensed the royal patronage and packed the House of Commons with his supporters. Under Walpole, the doctrine of cabinet solidarity developed. Walpole required that no minister other than himself have private dealings with the king, and also that when the cabinet had agreed on a policy, all ministers must defend it in public, or resign. As a later prime minister, Lord Melbourne, said, \\"It matters not what we say, gentlemen, so long as we all say the same thing.\\"","target":"cabinet solidarity","rationale":"The question asks why Walpole packed his friends into the House of Commons.

Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times.  Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them.  On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\"  Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign.

Passage:In the 1967 close season, Book was named captain following the transfer of previous captain Johnny Crossan to Middlesbrough, and was henceforth nicknamed Skip by his teammates. His first season as captain was a very successful one, leading Manchester City to their second league championship and playing every game. An Achilles injury sidelined Book for the first four months of the 1968–69 season, but he returned to the team in time for the start of their FA Cup run. In the week preceding the cup final, Book was named the 1969 Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year Award, sharing the accolade with Dave Mackay. The following Saturday Manchester City played Leicester in the FA Cup final. Manchester City won 1–0, and captain Book lifted the trophy.

As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.

The generation born between 1980 and 2001 grew up playing sports where scores and performance were played down because \\"everyone's winner.\\" And their report cards sounded more positive   than ever before. As a result, Stanford University professor Carol Dweck, PhD, calls them \\"the overpraised generation.\\"\\nDweck has been studying how people deal with failure for 40 years. Her research has led her to find out two clearly different mind-sets that have a great effect on how we react to it. Here's how they work:\\nA fixed mind-set is grounded in the belief that talent   is genetic - you're a born artist, point guard, or numbers person. The fixed mind-set believes it's sure to succeed without much effort and regards failure as personal shame. When things get difficult, it's quick to blame, lie, and even stay away from future difficulties.\\nOn the other hand, a growth mind-set believes that no talent is entirely heaven-sent and that effort and learning make everything possible. Because the ego   isn't on the line as much, the growth mind-set sees failure as a chance rather than shame. When faced with a difficulty, it's quick to rethink, change and try again. In fact, it enjoys this experience.\\nWe are all born with growth mind-sets. (Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to live in the world.) But parents, teachers, and instructors often push us into fixed mind-sets by encouraging certain actions and misdirecting praise. Dweck's book, Mind-set: The New Psychology of Success, and online instructional program explain this in depth. But she says there are many little things you can start doing today to make sure that your children, grandchildren and even you are never defeated by failure.\\nWhat should parents do for their children based on Dweck's study?\\nA) Encourage them to learn from failures.\\nB) Prevent them from making mistakes.\\nC) Guide them in doing little things.\\nD) Help them grow with praise.","target":"A","rationale":"The article explains that a mindset is the way someone thinks about their abilities and potential. If they have a fixed mindset, then they think of themselves as being born with certain talents which cannot be changed.

A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by the Board of or senior governance body within an organization where as procedures or protocols would be developed and adopted by senior executive officers. Policies can assist in both \\"subjective\\" and \\"objective\\" decision making. Policies to assist in subjective decision making would usually assist senior management with decisions that must consider the relative merits of a number of factors before making decisions and as a result are often hard to objectively test e.g. work-life balance policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested e.g. password policy.\\n\\n- Nonviolent resistance (NVR or nonviolent action) is the practice of achieving goals such as social change through symbolic protests, civil disobedience, economic or political noncooperation, satyagraha, or other methods, without using violence. This type of action highlights the desires of an individual or group that feels that something needs to change to improve the current condition of the resisting person or group. It is largely but wrongly taken as synonymous with civil resistance. Each of these terms (\\"nonviolent resistance\\" and \\"civil resistance\\") has its distinct merits and also quite different connotations and commitments.\\n\\n- As an act of protest , occupation is the entry into and holding of a building , space or symbolic site . As such , occupations often combine some of the following elements : a challenge to ownership of the space involved , an effort to gain public attention , the practical use of the facilities occupied , and a redefinition of the occupied space . Occupations may be conducted with varying degrees of physical force to obtain and defend the place occupied . Occupations may be brief or they may extend for weeks , months or years . In some cases of long - term occupation , the term protest camp may be applied , although occupation often connotes the use of space without permission or in defiance of governmental authority . Occupation , as a means of achieving change , emerged from worker struggles that sought everything from higher wages to the abolition of capitalism . Often called a sit - down strike , it is a form of civil disobedience in which an organized group of workers , usually employed at a factory or other centralized location , take possession of the workplace by \`\` sitting down '' at their stations , effectively preventing their employers from replacing them with strikebreakers or , in some cases , moving production to other locations . The recovered factories in Argentina is an example of workplace occupations moving beyond addressing workplace grievances , to demanding a change in ownership of the means of production . The Industrial Workers of the World were the first American union to use it , while the United Auto Workers staged successful sit - down strikes in the 1930s , most famously in the Flint Sit - Down Strike of 1936 - 1937 . Sit - down strikes were declared illegal by the US supreme court , but are still used by unions such as the UMWA in the Pittston strike , and the workers at the Republic Windows and Doors factory in Chicago .\\n\\n- A protest (also called a remonstrance, remonstration or demonstration) is an expression of bearing witness on behalf of an express cause by words or actions with regard to particular events, policies or situations. Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance.\\n\\n- Civil resistance is political action that relies on the use of nonviolent resistance by civil groups to challenge a particular power, force, policy or regime. Civil resistance operates through appeals to the adversary, pressure and coercion: it can involve systematic attempts to undermine the adversary's sources of power, both domestic and international. Forms of action have included demonstrations, vigils and petitions; strikes, go-slows, boycotts and emigration movements; and sit-ins, occupations, and the creation of parallel institutions of government. Civil resistance movements' motivations for avoiding violence are generally related to context, including a society's values and its experience of war and violence, rather than to any absolute ethical principle. Cases of civil resistance can be found throughout history and in many modern struggles, against both tyrannical rulers and democratically elected governments. The phenomenon of civil resistance is often associated with the advancement of democracy.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'subclass of' with the subject 'occupation '.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- action\\n - adversary\\n - bearing\\n - board\\n - civil resistance\\n - democracy\\n - demonstration\\n - experience\\n - group\\n - guide\\n - management\\n - nonviolent resistance\\n - number\\n - objective\\n - part\\n - person\\n - policy\\n - practice\\n - protest\\n - protocol\\n - public\\n - society\\n - system\\n - type\\n - violence\\n - witness","target":"demonstration","rationale":"As a protest, occupation is the entry into and holding of a building or symbolic site. \\nTherefore, demonstration can be an occupation if it meets this definition."},{"source":"You are given a news article headline from BBC Yoruba and your task is to classify it into one of the following categories:  Africa, Entertainment, Health, Nigeria, Politics, Sport, or World.\\n\\nPolice arrest: 'Ó léwu láti kọ́kọ́ yẹ ọlọ́pàá wò ní Nàìjíríà'","target":"Nigeria","rationale":"The headline contains words only in the Yoruba language.

Vienna saw it for the first time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as \\"an awkwardly updated production\\", though well performed. The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the \\"melodic suppleness and warmth\\" of Bizet's score.San Diego Opera first staged the work in 1993, but it was this company's 2004 production, designed by Zandra Rhodes, that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States.

The NFAT and CREB transcription factors and their upstream activators are known inducers of host and virally encoded genes.

Returned in Montefiascone, Ottone lost his powerful ally Urban IV, died on October 1264. Della Torre, however, never get Raimondo formal appointment, and after Martino's death, the once loyal Pallavicino family switched side to Visconti, scheming the assassination of Paganino della Torre, podestà of Vercelli, on January 1266. In response, the new lord of Milan Napoleone della Torre executed 53 nobles, suspected of conjuring. This vicious act undermined Della Torre's grab on Milan, aggravated by Pope Gregory X, a Visconti of Piacenza, who in 1273 confirmed Ottone Visconti as legal Archbishop of Milan. Napoleone della Torre reacted exiling all noble families who don't supported him, causing the formation of an émigré coalition in Novara and Pavia. Using their financial and military support, Ottone's nephew Teobaldo Visconti led an army in Vercelli, occupying Castelseprio. Defeated by Torriani's forces, Teobaldo fled to Lurate, near Como, but after a battle in Gallarate, his last forces were defeated and he was beheaded by Napoleone della Torre in 1276. Ottone, returned in Lombardy in the same year, recruited his supporters near Desio, where he was canon, and after a bloody battle on January 1277, Visconti emerged victorius.

The local paper, Winterset Madisonian, reported on page 4 of the edition of May 30, 1907 that Wayne weighed 13 lbs. (around 6 kg.) at birth. His middle name was soon changed from Robert to Mitchell when his parents decided to name their next son Robert.\\n\\nWayne's first color film was Shepherd of the Hills (1941), in which he co-starred with his longtime friend Harry Carey. The following year, he appeared in his only film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the Technicolor epic Reap the Wild Wind (1942), in which he co-starred with Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard; it was one of the rare times he played a character with questionable values.  In 1949, director Robert Rossen offered the starring role of All the King's Men to Wayne. Wayne refused, believing the script to be un-American in many ways. Broderick Crawford, who eventually got the role, won the 1949 Oscar for best male actor, ironically beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for Sands of Iwo Jima.  He lost the leading role in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck due to his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne's grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but for which he refused to bend.  One of Wayne's most popular roles was in The High and the Mighty (1954), directed by William Wellman, and based on a novel by Ernest K. Gann. His portrayal of a heroic copilot won widespread acclaim. Wayne also portrayed aviators in Flying Tigers (1942), Flying Leathernecks (1951), Island in the Sky (1953), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and Jet Pilot (1957).  He appeared in nearly two dozen of John Ford's films over twenty years, including She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) with James Stewart: the first movie in which he called someone \\"Pilgrim\\".

After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive \\"patchiness,\\" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Comparative Study 3)Coronary Circulation 4)Coronary Disease 5)Dogs 6)Drug Screening 7)Female 8)Human 9)Male 10)Microspheres 11)Myocardial Infarction 12)Myocardium 13)Necrosis 14)Recombinant Proteins 15)Superoxide Dismutase 16)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..","target":"Yes","rationale":"This abstract describes a study in which researchers used recombinant human superoxide dismutase (h-SOD) to prevent reperfusion injury in dogs that underwent proximal circumflex coronary artery occlusion for 90 minutes.

I've been having issues with him OF since mid year 7, and it's hit me really hard atm. I'm currently in year 9. Be warned, it's a long post. So, I've recently cut ties with OF because I'm so sick of his bullshit. It started in year 7 with little things. OF would constantly take up the majority of the table in class, leaving me with about 2 A4 sheets of room, barely enough to work. When I would complain to him about this he would get really childish and say things like \\"Is this better?\\" while proceeding to take up more space. This got too much for me, as I'm very dedicated with my work, so I moved. Problem solved? NO. He'd move next to me and do the same thing. That was just the start of it. OF would constantly seem to be seeking attention, as much as I hate that term. He would do all he can to be the center of everything. It started with little digs at us, using words like fagget loosely without knowing the meaning or history of the words. He would then get to headlocking us and trying to yank our hair out because it was 'fun'. It got to the point where he would steal our phones and run around the school so that we could chase him. This annoyed me and Callum a lot, and in OF's defense we could have kept our cool a bit more than we did. Either way, we got to the end of the year, things died down, and we went into year 8. This was when things got worse. OF had gotten over the desk control, but had somehow gotten worse. He started insulting us and making fun of us for things like our body shape, really petty and immature things. Then when we would have a go at him back(again, should've kept our cool), he would resort to violence again. This went on and on. He could insult us but we couldn't even joke about him. He would also get very angry if he lost in games of downfall, and sometimes again, resort to violence. Things went on until 4th term. The boys invited me to be their goalkeeper for a futsal team. This worried me, and I'd be here forever if I explained it all. Basically I have on and off mental health issues and possibly social anxiety, not sure though. It sounds stupid, but the position of goalkeeper is a lot of pressure on me. I told OF all this and more, and explained that I didn't think it would be good for my mental health (I was right). Not to my surprise, OF wasn't sympathetic in the slightest, despite 'weawwy tweasuwing my fwendship'. He went on for weeks saying shit like 'OoOoHhH nOoO I can't be goalie cus I have depression! Get over it fagget.'. This really got me down, and I still don't understand why he said that. The same kind of thing happened this year. I felt quite down during a futsal match and he picked up on it. Same kind of thing 'if you feel like shit then don't come.

A detailed description of Las Meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (\\"the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age\\") in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the  records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state.

There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health.

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles.\\nLaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village.

As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue.\\nThe group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest.

These minute insects, colloquially known as hoppers, are plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs, or trees. Their hind legs are modified for jumping, and are covered with hairs that facilitate the spreading of a secretion over their bodies that acts as a water repellent and carrier of pheromones. They undergo a partial metamorphosis, and have various host associations, varying from very generalized to very specific. Some species have a cosmopolitan distribution, or occur throughout the temperate and tropical regions. Some are pests or vectors of plant viruses and phytoplasmas. The family is distributed all over the world, and constitutes the second-largest hemipteran family, with at least 20,000 described species.\\n\\n- The cicadas (or ) are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. It is divided into the Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 1,300 species described from around the world; many undescribed species remain.\\n\\n- The Sternorrhyncha suborder of the Hemiptera contains the aphids, whiteflies, and scale insects, groups which were traditionally included in the order Homoptera. \\"Sternorrhyncha\\" refers to the rearward position of the mouthparts relative to the head. \\n\\n- The Auchenorrhyncha (former synonym: \\"Cicadinea\\") suborder of the Hemiptera contains most of the familiar members of what was called the Homoptera  groups such as cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, and spittlebugs. The aphids and scale insects are the other well-known \\"Homoptera\\", and they are in the suborder Sternorrhyncha. Lesser-known insects largely regarded as Homoptera are the Coleorrhyncha. However, the taxonomic status of the Hemiptera and Homoptera is currently under investigation and discussion. See Heteroptera and Prosorrhyncha for more information.\\n\\n- The Hemiptera or true bugs are an order of insects comprising some 50,000 to 80,000 species of groups such as the cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, and shield bugs. They range in size from to around , and share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts. The name \\"true bugs\\" is sometimes limited to the suborder Heteroptera. Many insects commonly known as \\"bugs\\" belong to other orders; for example, the lovebug is a fly, while the May bug and ladybug are beetles.\\n\\n- Treehoppers (more precisely typical treehoppers to distinguish them from the Aetalionidae) and thorn bugs are members of the family Membracidae, a group of insects related to the cicadas and the leafhoppers. About 3,200 species of treehoppers in over 400 genera are known. They are found on all continents except Antarctica; only three species are known from Europe. Individual treehoppers usually live for only a few months.\\n\\n- The scale insects are small insects of the order Hemiptera, suborder Sternorrhyncha. They comprise the superfamily Coccoidea, previously placed in the now obsolete group called \\"Homoptera\\". There are about 8,000 described species of scale insects.\\n\\n- Aphids, also known as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as greenflies, blackflies, or whiteflies (not to be confused with \\"jumping plant lice\\" or true whiteflies), are small sap-sucking insects, and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Many species are green but other commonly occurring species may be white and wooly, brown, or black. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. They are capable of extremely rapid increase in numbers by asexual reproduction. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners around the world. From a zoological standpoint they are a highly successful group of organisms. \\n\\n- A planthopper is any insect in the infraorder Fulgoromorpha, exceeding 12,500 described species worldwide. The name comes from their remarkable resemblance to leaves and other plants of their environment and from the fact that they often \\"hop\\" for quick transportation in a similar way to that of grasshoppers. However, planthoppers generally walk very slowly so as not to attract attention. Distributed worldwide, all members of this group are plant-feeders, though surprisingly few are considered pests. The infraorder contains only a single superfamily, Fulgoroidea. Fulgoroids are most reliably distinguished from the other Auchenorrhyncha by two features; the bifurcate (\\"Y\\"-shaped) anal vein in the forewing, and the thickened, three-segmented antennae, with a generally round or egg-shaped second segment (pedicel) that bears a fine filamentous arista.\\n\\n- The name Prosorrhyncha is a name (proposed by Sorensen et al. 1995) for a suborder of Hemiptera, comprising a grouping of the traditional taxon \\"Heteroptera\\" plus its sister taxon, the family Peloridiidae (often classified as a suborder itself). There is no agreement on the status of this taxon, as there are two competing classifications regarding this branch of the Hemiptera; while some hemipterists follow this classification (link below), it has by no means been accepted universally. See the Heteroptera article for the detailed discussion, and a comparison of the two taxoboxes.\\n\\n- Homoptera is a suborder of order Hemiptera that is considered by some taxonomists to be paraphyletic, and therefore deprecated (obsolete). It was therefore split into the suborders Sternorrhyncha, Auchenorrhyncha, and Coleorrhyncha. The earlier work was based on nuclear DNA, but more recent phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA suggest that Homoptera may be a monophyletic group after all, a sister group of Heteroptera. The cause of the disparity in the analyses is suggested to be the long branch attraction effect in phylogenetic analysis, due to rapidly evolving DNA regions.\\n\\n- Dictyopharidae is a family of bugs in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha belonging to the infraorder Fulgoromorpha . The family comprises nearly 760 species in more than 150 genera .\\n\\n- The Heteroptera are a group of about 40,000 species of insects in the order Hemiptera. Sometimes called \\"true bugs\\", that name more commonly refers to the Hemiptera as a whole, and \\"typical bugs\\" might be used as a more unequivocal alternative since among the Hemiptera, the heteropterans are most consistently and universally termed \\"bugs\\". \\"Heteroptera\\" is Greek for \\"different wings\\": most species have forewings with both membranous and hardened portions (called hemelytra); members of the primitive Enicocephalomorpha have completely membranous wings.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'dictyopharidae' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'.

The findings of four controlled studies and the experience of various communities have answered important questions. EMT-D programs have been shown effective in urban, suburban, and rural communities with and without paramedic backup. EMT-D programs appear safe, with errors of commission being extremely rare and errors of omission being of acceptably low incidence. Issues still to be resolved include the degree and amount of training that should be given and whether manual or automatic defibrillators should be used. Medical supervision and quality control is the most important aspect of EMT-D programs. At its core, the success of EMT-D programs is confirmation of the principle of early defibrillation. Wider dissemination of early defibrillation will improve survival from sudden cardiac death. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Allied Health Personnel 2)Electric Countershock 3)Emergency Medical Technicians 4)Human 5)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. 6)United States.","target":"Yes","rationale":"The main topic of this abstract is \\"defibrillation\\".

Most common types of DJs include radio DJ, club DJ who performs at a nightclub or music festival, and turntablist who uses record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. The title \\"DJ\\" is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted pseudonyms or stage names.\\n\\nSeveral techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.  Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dance floor. Turntablism embodies the art of cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of samples in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a musical instrument rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use harmonic mixing to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.  Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic synchronization of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \\"sync\\". Most DJ mixers now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.  In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.\\n\\nWhat are the DJ Techniques talked about in the article?","target":"These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources.","rationale":"The first full sentence in the second paragraph states: \\n\\"Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music.

In 1893, however, his grandfather was put into prison  for taking money. At the same time, his father became seriously ill. From that time on, his family were no longer accepted by their relatives  and friends. These early experiences greatly influenced his writing.\\nBy the time Lu Xun arrived in Nanjing to study at a college in 1899, he already believed that Chinese government had to change and become modern. In 1902 he went to study in Japan. There he began writing articles for some Chinese student magazines. He showed a gift for writing and translating  and he even wrote several books, though none was popular. He returned to China in 1909 because he was in need of money.\\nAfter working for a few years as a teacher in Beijing, Lu Xun again returned to writing. In 1918, he wrote his famous short story Diary of a Madman. It was the first Chinese novel using the everyday language that people spoke, which helped make it a great success. _ , together with his novel The True Story of Ah Q(1921), made Lu Xun a leading Chinese writer.\\nThough successful, Lu Xun still worried greatly about China's future.

This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 50 feet (15 m) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciations or ice ages. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (8 m) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida plateau, stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas. The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans. Starting about 100,000 years ago the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to 300 to 350 feet (90 to 110 m) below the contemporary level.

The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano:\\nI decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did.\\nDespite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".","target":"Monteux","rationale":"The answer is Monteux.\\nMonteaux was the conductor for two of Diaghilev's premieres, one of which (Le sacre du printemps) revolutionized music and made him famous. The text tells us that he had a negative initial reaction to Stravinsky’s score, leading to an ‘aching head’; but then worked with Stravinsky on his orchestral balance and effects before conducting it seventeen times in rehearsal - probably also helping to make him famous for this piece as well."},{"source":"In this task, you will be shown a sentence, and you should determine whether it is overruling or non-overruling.

All three of these nucleic acids work together to produce a protein. The mRNA takes the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located. Ribosomes are the organelles where the proteins are made. The ribosomes themselves are made out of rRNA and other proteins. The mRNA binds to the ribosome, bringing the genetic instructions to order the amino acids to the site of protein synthesis. Finally, the tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome ( Figure below and Figure below ). In mRNA, the four nucleotides (A, C, G, and U) are arranged into codons of three bases each. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except for the stop codons , which terminate protein synthesis. tRNA, which has a specific “3-leaf clover structure,” contains a three base region called the anticodon , which can base pair to the corresponding three-base codon region on mRNA.

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\".\\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall.\\nWood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom.

Isbell's parents divorced, and he has two much younger half-siblings, Chantry Barnett and Emily Isbell. Isbell grew up in rural North Alabama.\\n\\nJason Isbell released his first solo album, Sirens of the Ditch, on July 10, 2007. In 2012, Isbell supported singer-songwriter Ryan Adams on his tour. Both played solo acoustic sets.  On June 11, 2013, Isbell released his fourth solo album, Southeastern. Produced by Dave Cobb and featuring accompanying vocals by Kim Richey and Isbell's wife, Amanda Shires, Southeastern received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews, earning a score of 87 on Metacritic. Southeastern led to Isbell's clean sweep of the 2014 Americana Music Awards. Southeastern won Album of the Year, Isbell was named Artist of the Year, and the song \\"Cover Me Up\\" was named Song of the Year. NPR rock critic Ken Tucker listed Southeastern at No. 1 on his top ten albums of 2013. Isbell's record received praise by artists like Bruce Springsteen and John Prine. Isbell's music video for the song \\"Traveling Alone\\" features the Jackson House, a historic home in Moulton, Alabama. In 2014, his song \\"Cover Me Up\\" was used as the weather for the Welcome to Night Vale episode \\"Visitor\\".  Isbell's fifth solo record, Something More Than Free, was released on July 17, 2015, on Southeastern Records. Dave Cobb produced, continuing the partnership created with Isbell on Southeastern. They recorded the album at Nashville's Sound Emporium studio with a full band. During the summer of 2015, Isbell was on a North American tour to promote the album, with four consecutive sold-out nights at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville at the end of October. In April 2016, Isbell appeared on the BBC live-music show Later With Jools Holland, singing \\"The Life You Chose\\", one of the tracks from Something More Than Free.  Isbell said that compared to Southeastern, Something More Than Free has a feeling of celebration, which reflects his upcoming fatherhood and a forward-facing momentum. One track on the record, \\"To a Band I Loved\\", is a love-letter to the band Centro-Matic, a now defunct band from Denton, Texas, Isbell played with back in his Drive-By Truckers days.  Something More Than Free debuted at number 1 on Billboard Magazine's rock, folk and country record charts. Although Isbell had had critical success in the Americana genre, this was the first time he received such high ranking across genres.

We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes during the first year of HAART between HIV-1-infected patients in low-income and high-income settings.   \\n METHODS 18 HAART programmes in Africa, Asia, and South America (low-income settings) and 12 HIV cohort studies from Europe and North America (high-income settings) provided data for 4810 and 22,217, respectively, treatment-naïve adult patients starting HAART. All patients from high-income settings and 2725 (57%) patients from low-income settings were actively followed-up and included in survival analyses.   \\n FINDINGS Compared with high-income countries, patients starting HAART in low-income settings had lower CD4 cell counts (median 108 cells per muL vs 234 cells per muL), were more likely to be female (51%vs 25%), and more likely to start treatment with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (70%vs 23%). At 6 months, the median number of CD4 cells gained (106 cells per muL vs 103 cells per muL) and the percentage of patients reaching HIV-1 RNA levels lower than 500 copies/mL (76%vs 77%) were similar. Mortality was higher in low-income settings (124 deaths during 2236 person-years of follow-up) than in high-income settings (414 deaths during 20,532 person-years). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of mortality comparing low-income with high-income settings fell from 4.3 (95% CI 1.6-11.8) during the first month to 1.5 (0.7-3.0) during months 7-12. The provision of treatment free of charge in low-income settings was associated with lower mortality (adjusted HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08-0.61).   \\n INTERPRETATION Patients starting HAART in resource-poor settings have increased mortality rates in the first months on therapy, compared with those in developed countries. Timely diagnosis and assessment of treatment eligibility, coupled with free provision of HAART, might reduce this excess mortality.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract is structured in a way that makes it clear and concise.

The most common sites of involvement were the dorsal spine (62%), lumbosacral spine (72%), and pelvis (79%). Objective response to chemotherapy was observed in 59% of patients; complete responses were noted in 7%, and partial responses in 52%. The median survival was 28 months (range, 1-118 months). The median time lapse between the start of chemotherapy and disease progression was 14 months (range, 1-109 months). In 32 patients who responded to the treatment, chemotherapy was discontinued after 2 years, and their median duration of continued remission at 39 and 75 months after the completion of therapy. The incidence of pathological fractures was 57%; the most common sites were the spine, which sustained compression fractures, and the ribs. The incidences of hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression due to metastases were 19% and 10%, respectively. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Aged 3)Antineoplastic Agents, Combined 4)Bone Neoplasms 5)Breast Neoplasms 6)Female 7)Fractures 8)Human 9)Middle Age 10)Spine 11)Time Factors.","target":"Yes","rationale":"All of the options are MeSH terms that are applicable to this abstract.

It may also refer to the mother church of a diocese i.e. Cathedral or a metropolitan church. The term has specific meanings within different Christian denominations.\\n\\n- London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.\\n\\n- The Gregorian mission or Augustinian mission was sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to convert Britain's Anglo-Saxons. Headed by Augustine of Canterbury, by the death of the last missionary in 635 the mission had established Christianity in southern Britain. Along with the Irish and Frankish missions it converted other parts of Britain as well and influenced the Hiberno-Scottish missions to Continental Europe.\\n\\n- Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education.\\n\\n- A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".\\n\\n- The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. These events were, in part, associated with the wider process of the European Protestant Reformation, a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across all of Europe during this period. Many factors contributed to the process: the decline of feudalism and the rise of nationalism, the rise of the common law, the invention of the printing press and increased circulation of the Bible, and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars, the upper and middle classes and readers in general. However, the various phases of the English Reformation, which also covered Wales and Ireland, were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself.\\n\\n- A school is an institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students (or \\"pupils\\") under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools.

The town is on a meander of the River Thames, with a large number of parks and open spaces, including Richmond Park, and many protected conservation areas, which include much of Richmond Hill. A specific Act of Parliament protects the scenic view of the River Thames from Richmond.\\nRichmond was founded following Henry VII's building of Richmond Palace in the 16th century, from which the town derives its name. (The Palace itself was named after Henry's earldom of Richmond, North Yorkshire.) During this era the town and palace were particularly associated with Elizabeth I, who spent her last days here. During the 18th century Richmond Bridge was completed and many Georgian terraces were built, particularly around Richmond Green and on Richmond Hill. These remain well preserved and many have listed building architectural or heritage status. The opening of the railway station in 1846 was a significant event in the absorption of the town into a rapidly expanding London.\\n\\n- The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013.

At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. \\n\\n- Charing Cross denotes the junction of Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square in central London. It gives its name to several landmarks, including Charing Cross railway station, one of the main London rail terminals.\\n\\n- Richmond Park, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, was created by Charles I in the 17th century as a deer park. The largest of London's Royal Parks, it is of national and international importance for wildlife conservation. The park is a national nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation and is included, at Grade I, on Historic England's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. Its landscapes have inspired many famous artists and it has been a location for several films and TV series.\\n\\n- Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.\\n\\n- A secondary school, often referred to as a high school or a senior high school, is a school which provides secondary education, between the ages of 11 and 19 depending on location, after primary school and before higher education.\\n\\n- Augustine of Canterbury (first third of the 6th century  probably 26 May 604) was a Benedictine monk who became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 597.

Owned by the Crown Estate, it is leased to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. The Green, which has been described as \\"one of the most beautiful urban greens surviving anywhere in England\\", is essentially square in shape and its open grassland, framed with broadleaf trees, extends to roughly twelve acres. On the north-east side there is also a smaller open space called Little Green. Richmond Green and Little Green are overlooked by a mixture of period townhouses, historic buildings and municipal and commercial establishments including the Richmond Lending Library and Richmond Theatre. On summer weekends and public holidays the Green attracts many residents and visitors. It has a long history of hosting sporting events; from the 16th century onwards tournaments and archery contests have taken place on the Green, while cricket matches have occurred since the mid 18th century, continuing to the present day.\\n\\n- Richmond Palace was a royal residence on the River Thames in England that stood in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It lay upstream and on the opposite bank from the Palace of Westminster, which lay nine miles (14 km) to the north-east. It was erected about 1501 by Henry VII of England, formerly known as \\"Earl of Richmond\\", in honour of which the manor of Sheen had recently been renamed as \\"Richmond\\", later to become Richmond upon Thames. It replaced a palace, itself built on the site of a manor house appropriated by the Crown some two centuries before.\\n\\n- The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion.

A meander forms when moving water in a stream erodes the outer banks and widens its valley, and the inner part of the river has less energy and deposits silt. A stream of any volume may assume a \\"meandering\\" course, alternately eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a \\"snaking\\" pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake forms. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges.\\n\\n- Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.\\n\\n- A national church is a Christian church associated with a specific ethnic group or nation state. The idea was notably discussed during the 19th century, during the emergence of modern nationalism.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'christ's school' with the relationship of 'located in the administrative territorial entity'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- banks\\n - bend\\n - canterbury\\n - centre\\n - city of canterbury\\n - cross\\n - district\\n - england\\n - european union\\n - gloucestershire\\n - goes\\n - hill\\n - isle of wight\\n - london\\n - london borough of richmond upon thames\\n - mission\\n - most\\n - national park\\n - north yorkshire\\n - northern\\n - of\\n - oxford\\n - portal\\n - post\\n - reading\\n - richmond\\n - richmondshire\\n - rise\\n - river\\n - rome\\n - scotland\\n - south\\n - south yorkshire\\n - southwest\\n - split\\n - strand\\n - street\\n - surrey\\n - union\\n - windsor\\n - yorkshire","target":"london borough of richmond upon thames","rationale":"Christ's School is located in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.\\n\\nSo, we choose 'london borough of richmond upon thames' to answer this question because it related to \\"christ's school\\" with a relationship of \\"is located\\"."},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nMona is sitting at the beach watching the waves.

A cross sensitivity to Toxicodendron was demonstrated clinically and on patch testing. The allergen in Toxicodendron, 3 pentadecylcatechol, is closely linked in chemical structure to 5-pentadecylresorcinol, present in Grevillea banksii and tridecylresorcinol in Grevillea robusta. Patch testing in patients sensitive to Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' with tridecylresorcinol produced positive reactions, thus implicating the sensitizing role of long chain alkyl resorcinols in Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' allergy. There is a likelihood that this sensitizing potential extends to other plants of the Grevillea genus, e.g., Grevillea robusta. With the spread of Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' to other markets, this problem will become increasingly common.","target":"Adult","rationale":"The abstract describes the potential danger of Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' plants that have recently been planted extensively in Australia and have also been exported to the United States.

In 1721 he was able to incite the Choctaw who began to raid Chickasaw villages, and to ambush pack trains along the Trader's Path leading to Charleston, South Carolina. In response, the Chickasaw regrouped their villages more tightly for defense, and cemented relations with their British source of guns by establishing a settlement at Savannah Town, South Carolina, in 1723. They blocked French traffic on the Mississippi River by occupying Chickasaw Bluff near present day Memphis, and bargained for peace with the Choctaw. Bienville himself was recalled to France in 1724 . On and off over the following years, the French successfully reignited the Indian conflict. The Choctaw pursued their familiar hit and run tactics: ambushing hunting parties, killing trader's horses, devastating croplands after using superior numbers to drive the Chickasaw into their forts, and killing peace emissaries. Illini and Iroquois occasionally pitched in from the north as well. This war of attrition effectively wore the Chickasaw down, reaching a crisis level in the late 1730s and especially the early 1740s. After a lapse due to strife within the Choctaw, the bloody harassment resumed in the 1750s. The Chickasaw remained obstinate, their situation forcing them to adhere even more closely to the British.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort.

This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab.

The answer must be case B because it increases in reactant as well as increasing its product than decreasing its other products meaning reverse reaction is disfavored therefore favoriting forward reaction which leads to overall decrease on chemical system thus increasing number of moles/concentration amount"},{"source":"Find the movie name from the given conversation.

The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics.\\n\\n- A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted.\\n\\n- Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe.

It originates at the northwest extremity of Lake Sevan and flows south through the Kotayk Province and Armenia's capital, Yerevan; the lake in turn is fed by several streams. In the Ararat plain it joins the Aras River along the border with Turkey. A series of hydro-electric plants have been constructed on the river. Its waters are in demand to irrigate crops. It also meets drinking water requirements and provides for recreation.\\n\\n- A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. \\nThe soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.\\n\\n- Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment.
