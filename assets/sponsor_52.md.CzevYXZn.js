Cellular transformation is associated with deregulated expression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes. E7 has been shown to bind a number of cellular proteins, including the cell cycle control protein pRb. In this study, RNA aptamers (small, singlestranded oligonucleotides selected for high-affinity binding) to HPV16 E7 were employed as molecular tools to further investigate these protein-protein interactions. This study is focused on one aptamer (termed A2). Transfection of this molecule into HPV16-transformed cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation (shown using real-time cell electronic sensing and MTT assays) due to the induction of apoptosis (as demonstrated by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining). GST-pull down and bead binding assays were used to demonstrate that the binding of A2 required N-terminal residues of E7 known to be involved in interaction with the cell cycle control protein, pRb. Using a similar approach, A2 was shown to disrupt the interaction between E7 and pRb in vitro. Furthermore, transfection of HPV16-transformed cells with A2 appeared to result in the loss of E7 and rise in pRb levels, as observed by immunoblotting. Conclusions/Significance: This paper includes the first characterisation of the effects of an E7 RNA aptamer in a cell line derived from a cervical carcinoma. Transfection of cells with A2 was correlated with the loss of E7 and the induction of apoptosis. Aptamers specific for a number of cellular and viral proteins have been documented previously; one aptamer (Macugen) is approved for clinical use and several others are in clinical trials. In addition to its role as a molecular tool, A2 could have further applications in the future. \\n Title: An RNA Aptamer Provides a Novel Approach for the Induction of Apoptosis by Targeting the HPV16 E7 Oncoprotein","target":"True","rationale":"The title of the paper describes a novel approach for inducing apoptosis by targeting HPV16 E7.

He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat.\\n\\nSingh was born on 6 July 1985 into a Sindhi family in Mumbai, to Anju and Jagjit Singh Bhavnani. His grandparents, Sunder Singh Bhavnani and Chand Burke, moved to Mumbai from Karachi, Sindh, (present-day Pakistan) during the Partition of India. He has an elder sister named Ritika Bhavnani. Singh is the maternal cousin of actress Sonam Kapoor and producer Rhea Kapoor, daughters of actor Anil Kapoor and wife Sunita Kapoor (nee Bhavnani). Singh explains that he dropped his surname Bhavnani, since he felt that the name would have been \\"too long, too many syllables\\", thus downplaying his brand as a \\"saleable commodity\\".  Singh always aspired to be an actor, participating in several school plays and debates. Once when he had gone for a birthday party, his grandmother asked him to dance and entertain her. Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in the lawn and started dancing to the song \\"Chumma Chumma\\" from the 1991 action film, Hum. He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing. However, after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, Singh realised that getting a break in the film industry was not at all easy, as it was mostly people with a film background who got these opportunities. Feeling that the idea of acting was \\"too far-fetched\\", Singh focused on creative writing. He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University.  At the university, he decided to take acting classes and took up theatre as his minor. After completing his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007, Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter, with agencies like O&M and J. Walter Thompson. He then worked as an assistant director, but left it to pursue acting. He then decided to send his portfolio to directors. He would go for all kinds of auditions, but did not get any good opportunities, while only getting calls for minor roles: \\"Everything was so bleak. It was very frustrating.

At its height, the Sun headquarters were in Santa Clara, California (part of Silicon Valley), on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center.\\n\\n- Java OpenGL ( JOGL ) is a wrapper library that allows OpenGL to be used in the Java programming language . It was originally developed by Kenneth Bradley Russell and Christopher John Kline , and was further developed by the Sun Microsystems Game Technology Group . Since 2010 , it has been an independent open source project under a BSD license . It is the reference implementation for Java Bindings for OpenGL ( JSR - 231 ) . JOGL allows access to most OpenGL features available to C language programs through the use of the Java Native Interface ( JNI ) . It offers access to both the standard GL * functions along with the GLU * functions ; however the OpenGL Utility Toolkit ( GLUT ) library is not available for window - system related calls , as Java has its own windowing systems : Abstract Window Toolkit ( AWT ) , Swing , and some extensions .\\n\\n- A thin client is a lightweight computer that is purpose-built for remote access to a server (typically cloud or desktop virtualization environments). It depends heavily on another computer (its \\"server\\") to fulfill its computational roles. The specific roles assumed by the server may vary, from hosting a shared set of virtualized applications, a shared desktop stack or virtual desktop, to data processing and file storage on the client's or user's behalf. This is different from the desktop PC (fat client), which is a computer designed to take on these roles by itself.\\n\\n- vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX.\\n\\n- Java Binding for the OpenGL API is a JSR API specification (JSR 231) for the Java Platform, Standard Edition which allows to use OpenGL on the Java (software platform). There is also Java Binding for the OpenGL ES API (JSR 239) for the Java Platform, Micro Edition.\\n\\n- Java Platform, Standard Edition or Java SE is a widely used platform for development and deployment of portable code for desktop and server environments. Java SE uses the object-oriented Java programming language. It is part of the Java software-platform family. Java SE defines a wide range of general-purpose APIs  such as Java APIs for the Java Class Library  and also includes the Java Language Specification and the Java Virtual Machine Specification. One of the most well-known implementations of Java SE is Oracle Corporation's Java Development Kit (JDK).\\n\\n- Unix (trademarked as UNIX) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, developed starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.\\n\\n- Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. While they are less common than standalone Java applications, Java applets run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications and can be embedded in HTML pages.\\n\\n- A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.\\n\\n- Java Platform, Micro Edition, or Java ME, is a Java platform designed for embedded systems (such as mobile devices, for example). Target devices range from industrial controls to mobile phones (especially feature phones) and set-top boxes. Java ME was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME).\\n\\n- Open Graphics Library (OpenGL)\\nis a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where the processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card, or it can be embedded on the motherboard orin certain CPUson the CPU die.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'platform' with 'java virtual machine'.","target":"java opengl","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"java opengl\\""},{"source":"Is the premise \\"a group of asian teenagers sitting in what looks like a waiting room with blue and red chairs, show off their electronic mini cameras.\\" true if \\"some young asians show off their cameras\\"?\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"yes","rationale":"The premise reflects the second sentence, which is also a valid description of what can be seen in the photo (asian teenagers sitting in blue and red chairs).

Facial burns are very common and are devastating to the affected patient and results into numerous physical, emotional and psychosocial sequels. Partial thickness facial burns are very common especially among children. This study compares the effect of standard moist open technique management and a moist closed technique for partial thickness burns of the face.   \\n PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with partial-thickness facial burns admitted in the burn unit, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt in the period from April 2009 to December 2009 were included in this study. They were divided into two groups to receive either open treatment with MEBO(®) (n=20) or coverage with Aquacel(®) Ag (n=20). Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, TBSA, burn areas), length of hospital stay (LOS), rate of infections, time to total healing, frequency of dressing changes, pain, cost benefit and patient discomfort were compared between the two groups. The long-term outcome (incidence of hypertrophic scarring) was assessed for up to 6 months follow-up period.   \\n RESULTS There were no significant differences in demographics between the two groups. In the group treated with the Aquacel(®) Ag, the mean time for re-epithelialization was 10.5 days, while it was 12.4 days in the MEBO(®) group (p<0.05). Frequency of changes, pain and patient discomfort were less with Aquacel(®) Ag. Cost was of no significant difference between the two groups. Scar quality improved in the Aquacel(®) Ag treatment group. Three and 6 months follow-up was done and long-term outcomes were recorded in both groups.   \\n CONCLUSION Moist occlusive dressing (Aquacel(®) Ag) significantly improves the management and healing rate of partial thickness facial burns with better long-term outcome compared to moist open dressing (MEBO(®)).","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the objective of the study (\\"This study compares the effect of standard moist open technique management and a moist closed technique for partial thickness burns of the face.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes their main findings (\\"Moist occlusive dressing(Aquacel(R) Ag) significantly improves the management and healing rate of partial thickness facial burns with better long-term outcome compared to moist open dressing (MEBO(R)).\\").

Air-conditioning began to spread in industries as a production aid during World War II. Today most Americans need to take air-conditioning for granted to homes, offices, factories, theatres, shops, studios, schools, hotels, and restaurants, and we can see it almost everywhere in today's America.\\nBut not everybody is aware that high cost and easy comfort are merely two of the effects of the vast cooling of American. In fact, air conditioning has substantially altered the country's character and customs.\\nMany of the byproducts are so conspicuous  that they are scarcely noticed. To begin with, air-conditioning transformed the face of America by making possible those glassy, boxy, sealed-in skyscrapers. It has been indispensable, no less, to the functioning of sensitive advanced computers, whose high operating temperatures require that they be constantly cooled. . .\\nIt has, at will, forced families into going back into families with closed doors and shut windows to improve the effects of the air-conditioning, reducing the interactions of neighborhood life. I think there is no need explaining the seriousness of this consequence . It is really surprising that the public's often noted withdrawal into self-pursuit and privacy has kept in pace with the historic spread of air-conditioning. Though science has little studied how habitual air-conditioning affects mind and body, some medical experts suggest that, like other technical avoidance of natural changes in climate, air-conditioning may damage the human capacity to adapt to stress. If so, air-conditioning is only like many other greatly useful technical developments that liberate  man from nature by increasing his productivity and power in some way - while indirectly weakening him in others.\\nQuestion: The tone of this passage reveals that air-conditioning   _  .\\n- has little effect on its users\\n- has more effect on body than on mind\\n- brings only damage to its users\\n- does harm as well as good to its users","target":"does harm as well as good to its users","rationale":"The tone of the article is critical and somewhat negative, revealing that air-conditioning has both positive and negative effects on its users.

The question will ask about the location of an object in the story with respect to either none or one of the three scenarios. Note that there are distractor sentences in each story that are unrelated to the question and are designed to confuse the reader.\\n\\nEvelyn entered the dining_room. Liam entered the dining_room. Phone rang. The orange is in the red_bottle. Liam exited the dining_room. Evelyn moved the orange to the blue_box. Charlotte entered the staircase. Phone rang. Liam entered the staircase.

Ethan exited the TV_room. Charlotte moved the onion to the green_drawer. Ethan entered the patio. Evelyn entered the patio. Phone rang. The asparagus is in the green_cupboard. Evelyn exited the patio. Ethan moved the asparagus to the green_basket. Where does Ethan think that Evelyn searches for the asparagus?","target":"green_cupboard","rationale":"The question asks where Ethan thinks that Evelyn searches for the asparagus. In order to answer this question, we need to know where Evelyn is looking for the asparagus and whether or not she has a false belief about it. The story says that Evelyn moved the onion into the green_drawer and then entered the patio before moving the asparagus into green_basket. Since she didn't move any objects during her time in patio, we can infer that this is where she was searching for an object, which was most likely the apple in blue_crate since she moved it after leaving patio. Now we just need to figure out if Ethan had a false belief about what Evelyn was trying to find. The story states that while they were in TV_room, Ethan moved apple from blue_crate into green_cupboard and exited TV room alone before returning with Charlotte (who previously entered staircase). Since he changed location of an object without mentioning anything about his intent between leaving and re-entering TV room (conclusion supported by fact: Phone rang.), he probably wasn't attempting to hide objects from Charlotte or anyone else who may have been with them at time of phone ringing (conclusion supported by fact: Liam exited staircase.). Therefore, he did not have a false belief about what Evelyn was trying to find when entering patio together so his original perception of situation should be same as reality which means he would think correct location is one last mentioned in story i.e., green cupboard"},{"source":"Choose between \\"air\\" and  \\"water\\".\\nQuestion: Jon shot a bullet from his gun into both water and air.

I came to a university about an hour and a half from my home and my boyfriend from back home would come to visit every weekend. \\n\\nFor some background, my parents have always been kind of ...weird? I hesitate to call them outright abusive, but going out to see my friends would always result in them making me feel guilty about not staying home with my family. I’d be expected to watch my sister (8) and brother (6) all summer long and during the week.\\n\\nThey were always specifically weird about me dating. My best friend when I was in 9th grade asked me out and I said yes. Yes we were both girls; yes I’m bi. Anyway, my parents flipped actual shit. I had come out to them, but I don’t think it was about that. They wanted me to explain why EXACTLY I liked my friend and wouldn’t accept the answers I would give. They cut me off from my only 2 friends and put me on “suicide watch” (my mom is a psych nurse). When I told my psychiatrist I felt depressed and had considered suicide, my parents yelled at me and told me it wasn’t that big of a deal. \\n\\nFlash forward to the fall of junior year, I start talking more and more to this guy that had always been part of my friend group but I never got to know that well. I tell my parents I want to date him. I immediately am told that I’ll never be left alone with him and that he’s not good enough for me and this and that. I broke it off with him quickly due to the intense pressure they had been putting on the relationship. Not too long afterwards, we started dating again because that’s what horny 16 year olds do. It had been kind of rough, but once he got his own car, we were able to sneak around pretty well. \\n\\nMy parents always suspected we were together. I told them we were casually dating but not official and I honestly think they have forgotten I told them that. My boyfriend and I have been together 2 years as of October though, and I’m honestly really happy in my relationship. \\n\\nFlash forward to early October this year: my parents find a corner of one of those sex ed condoms in my room back home and call me while I’m studying in the library. I’m essentially told I’m a whore (which I’ve actually been called due to my being on birth control because of suspected endometriosis), to send my phone (which my step father pays for... I wasn’t ever able to get a job back home because I was expected to babysit and no one would teach me how to drive) back to my parents, and that my parents wouldn’t be sending me the prescription for my Vyvanse (which I’ve been on for about 6 years for ADHD). I was accused of having sex in the house — something that would have been nearly impossible due to my parent’s schedules and also I just wouldn’t do that. \\n\\nNeedless to say, university was pretty difficult while I was unmedicated. I also got a statement from my school telling me that I owed them some $5,000. Seeing as my parents had effectively disowned me and my school wasn’t going to let me register for classes next semester because I had literally $200 in my bank account, I stopped going to classes and found a job. \\n\\nI was applying for a job at a coffee shop and an insurance agent from across the street told me to come in to her office and she’d interview me right then and there for a job as a telemarketer. Long story short, I ended up being pretty decent so she paid for me to take the licensing exam and I’m currently just waiting for the state to process my application. \\n\\nMy boyfriend from back home went to the local community college because he’s going to be able to go for 2 years debt free and then transfer to a university for comp sci. He’s moving down here on Friday (and I’m moving in with him) and he’s gonna go to the community here. Before you tell me how silly that is because we’re only 18, trust me I know, but really there wasn’t any other way I could get an apartment that I can afford before I get kicked out of my dorm because it’s the end of the semester. His parents are helping us out so much and I will be eternally grateful for them. \\n\\nMy parents wanted me to come home for thanksgiving. Apparently my mom (39) has been having seizures? My family has a history of weird made-up sounding medical conditions and I’m honestly not even sure what’s real or not in regards to that. I didn’t go home if that isn’t obvious. I also don’t think I want to come home for Christmas either. \\n\\nMy parents tell me it’s not fair to my brother and sister that I don’t come home, but I honestly fear for my safety if I were to go back home. My mom has filed a PFA against my step dad essentially for false imprisonment before and I honestly would have been able to do the same at least 3 times. \\n\\nTo be clear, my mom and I talk sporadically, but it’s not like she’s offering to talk about what’s going on. They came down here after the incident to have dinner with my boyfriend and I go talk about what happened. It was actually terrible. They put my sister in the chair between him and I and they were essentially interrogating me the whole time. My step dad kept offering me money (which he wouldn’t have actually given me) to break up with my boyfriend. My boyfriend isn’t like a terrible person or anything. He was a decent student I high school and my friend group is really just d&amp;d and mtg nerds. I was very involved in high school (president of like 3 clubs) and he supported me every step of the way. My parents know all of this. \\n\\n\\nI know there are probably gaps that I didn’t fill in all the way, so feel free to ask questions.

Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'place of birth' with the subject 'henry kaiser '.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- angeles\\n - baja\\n - baja california\\n - california\\n - center\\n - centre\\n - clara\\n - francisco\\n - fresno\\n - home\\n - ii\\n - los angeles county\\n - mount rainier\\n - mount shasta\\n - napa\\n - new york\\n - oakland\\n - of\\n - pacific\\n - pacific ocean\\n - san bernardino\\n - san bernardino county\\n - san francisco\\n - san francisco bay area\\n - santa clara\\n - sonoma\\n - southern california\\n - york","target":"oakland","rationale":"The information provided includes an article about Henry Kaiser, who is a guitarist and composer.

It would have been 1751-1752 all over again except that they had to face Alaungpaya instead of an effete dynasty. At first, the invasion went as planned. The Hanthawaddy forces led by Upayaza, the heir-apparent and Gen. Talaban defeated the Konbaung armies led by Alaungpaya's sons Naungdawgyi and Hsinbyushin at Myingyan. One Hanthawaddy army chased Hsinbyushin to Ava, and laid siege to the city. Another army chased Naungdawgyi's army, advancing as far as Kyaukmyaung a few miles from Shwebo, where Alaungpaya was residing. The Hanthawaddy flotilla had complete control of the entire Irrawaddy River. But they could not make further progress. They met heavy Konbaung resistance at Kyaukmyaung, and lost many men trying to take a heavily fortified Ava. Two months into the invasion, the invasion was going nowhere. The Hanthawaddy forces had lost many men and boats, and were short on ammunition and supplies. In May, Alaungpaya personally led his armies  in the Konbaung counterattack, and pushed back the invaders to Sagaing, on the west bank of the Irrawaddy, opposite Ava. On the east bank, Hsinbyushin also broke the siege of Ava. With the rainy season just a few weeks away, the Hanthawaddy command decided to retreat. Meanwhile, Burman refugees who had escaped general slaughter by the delta Mons seized Prome , the historical border town between Upper Burma and Lower Burma, and shut the gates to the retreating Hanthawaddy armies. Knowing the importance of Prome for the safety of his kingdom, King Binnya Dala of Hanthawaddy ordered his forces to retake Prome at any cost.

Although my house was already full of cats and dogs, I still couldn't resist an occasional visit to the shelter. This time as I was walking down the row of pens full of barking dogs I noticed a small boy looking into one of them.\\n He had a malnourished  looking body and a bony face with a big nose sticking out of the middle of it. He was looking at a small, golden dog. Its bony ribs were showing and its thin tail was folded between its legs. It wasn't begging for attention like the other puppies but was hiding in the corner instead. The boy looked up at me with sad eyes and asked what was wrong with it. \\"It was probably abused and abandoned\\", I said. \\"That is why it is so scared.\\"\\nThe boy immediately turned to an older lady and said, \\"Grandma, I want this one.\\" The old woman smiled and walked to the front desk to fill out the adoption forms. I followed and asked about the boy. I found out that he'd had a rough start in life too. She had just gotten custody  of him after the state had taken him from his parents. She had hoped getting a dog would make it easier on him. I looked back at him, holding his scared puppy, and said a prayer for them both.\\nIt was yesterday. I was driving down the road enjoying a gloriously sunny, spring day. Then in a green front yard I saw the boy. His teenage body was tall and strong. His nose no longer seemed big but fit well into his smiling face. He was throwing a ball to a healthy, happy dog with shining golden hair. His little act of love and kindness had indeed gone a long way. It had saved a dog's life, healed his own heart, and given this middle-aged man fresh hope for us all.\\nQuestion: The author entered the animal shelter because   _   .\\n- he loves dogs and pets\\n- it was too cold outside\\n- he wanted to buy a dog\\n- he wanted to see the boy","target":"he loves dogs and pets","rationale":"The author of the article is a middle-aged man who regularly visits an animal shelter to look at dogs and cats.

We characterized and compared the DNA-binding properties of PriB from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (StPriB) and Escherichia coli (EcPriB). Only one residue of EcPriB, V6, was different in StPriB (replaced by A6). Previous structural information revealed that this residue is located on the putative dimer-dimer interface of PriB and is not involved in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding. The cooperative binding mechanism of StPriB to DNA is, however, very different from that of EcPriB. Unlike EcPriB, which forms a single complex with ssDNAs of various lengths, StPriB forms two or more distinct complexes. Based on these results, as well as information on structure, binding modes for forming a stable complex of PriB with ssDNA of 25 nucleotides (nt), (EcPriB)25, and (StPriB)25 are proposed.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract focuses on the differences in DNA-binding properties between StPriB and EcPriB.

In this paper, we take a manifold view of the problem by introducing a smoothness term over the sample graph to attain harmonic functions to enforce consistent mappings during the translation. We develop HarmonicGAN to learn bi-directional translations between the source and the target domains. With the help of similarity-consistency, the inherent self-consistency property of samples can be maintained. Distance metrics defined on two types of features including histogram and CNN are exploited. Under an identical problem setting as CycleGAN, without additional manual inputs and only at a small training-time cost, HarmonicGAN demonstrates a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement over the state of the art, as well as improved interpretability. We show experimental results in a number of applications including medical imaging, object transfiguration, and semantic labeling. We outperform the competing methods in all tasks, and for a medical imaging task in particular our method turns CycleGAN from a failure to a success, halving the mean-squared error, and generating images that radiologists prefer over competing methods in 95% of cases.","target":"Smooth regularization over sample graph for unpaired image-to-image translation results in significantly improved consistency","rationale":"Here’s a brief summary:\\\\nSmooth regularization over sample graph for unpaired image-to-image translation results in significantly improved consistency."},{"source":"Article: To accommodate the ruling in Hopwood v. Texas banning any use of race in school admissions, the State of Texas passed a law guaranteeing entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of their graduating class. Florida and California have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other criteria. Class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools. This effect, however, may be intentional since less-funded, less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high. Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self. The top 10% rule adds racial diversity only because schools are still highly racially segregated because of residential patterns.

This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.\\n\\n- The Algiers Observatory was built in the late 19th century in the Algiers suburb of Bouzaréah, Algeria, North Africa. It participated in the Astrographic Catalogue project, taking the zone between -2 and +4 degrees to expose 1,260 plates between the years 1891 and 1911. At the tail end of that time, the director of the installation was François Gonnessiat. \\n\\n- The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km).\\n\\n- An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.\\n\\n- A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that\\nThe term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.\\n\\n- 1333 Cevenola, provisional designation , is a binary Eunomian asteroid from the asteroid belt, approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 20 February 1934, by French astronomer Odette Bancilhon at Algiers Observatory, Algeria in Northern Africa.\\n\\n- Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.\\n\\n- Bouzaréah is a suburb of Algiers, the capital of Algeria, North Africa, and its eleventh district.

November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany.

The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 made land available to immigrants from Europe and migrants from the colonies to the south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands, but these efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places such as Saint-Domingue or fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population. Following the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and it continues to govern relations to some extent between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians. The Quebec Act addressed this and other issues in 1774, raising concerns in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \\"popery.\\" The Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.\\nAnswer this question: What event happened first, the deportation of Arcadians, or King George III issuing the Royal Proclamation?","target":"deportation of Arcadians","rationale":"The deportation of Arcadians began in 1755, while King George III issued the Royal Proclamation on October 7th in 1763.

We used a complex consisting of the epitope peptide of the MERS-CoV S protein and CpG-DNA encapsulated in liposome complex to immunize mice, and produced the monoclonal antibodies 506-2G10G5 and 492-1G10E4E2. The western blotting data showed that both monoclonal antibodies detected the S protein and immunoprecipitated the native form of the S protein. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal analysis suggested strong reactivity of the antibodies towards the S protein of MERS-CoV virus infected Vero cells. Furthermore, the 506-2G10G5 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced plaque formation in MERS-CoV infected Vero cells compared to normal mouse IgG and 492-1G10E4E2.

In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen.\\n\\nHint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters.

This study describes the potent in vivo effect of pertussigen on the levels of antigen-specific macrophage-activating lymphokine(s); lymphokine(s) was measured by the stimulation of macrophage procoagulant activity (mPCA), or plasminogen activator (PA) activity. Lymphoid cells were removed from immunized animals and cultured with specific antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, ovalbumin, or human gamma-globulin. The culture supernatants were then incubated with the monocyte-like cell line WEHI-265 to measure mPCA or with WEHI-265 or resident peritoneal macrophages to measure PA activity. Mice were given pertussigen at the time of immunization, and the subsequent generation by lymphocyte supernatants of both of these macrophage activities proved to be greatly enhanced; the effect of pertussigen was antigen specific.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.\\n\\n- Ioannina, often called Yannena within Greece, is the capital and largest city of Epirus, an administrative region in north-western Greece.

The term is used mostly by Greeks and is associated with the existence of a substantial ethnic Greek population in the region. It also has connotations with political claims on the territory on the grounds that it was held by Greece and in 1914 was declared an independent state by the local Greeks against annexation to the newly founded Albanian principality. The term is typically rejected by most Albanians for its irredentist associations.\\n\\n- Kosovo  is a disputed territory and partially recognised state in Southeast Europe that declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 as the Republic of Kosovo.

It is roughly 160 km long, with a maximum elevation of 2,637 m (Mount Smolikas). Because it runs along the border of Thessaly and Epirus, the Pindus range is often called the \\"spine of Greece\\". The mountain range stretches from near the Greek-Albanian borders in Northern Epirus, entering the Epirus region and Macedonia region in northern Greece down to the north of the Peloponnese. Geologically it constitutes an extension of the Dinaric Alps, which dominate the western region of the Balkan Peninsula.

It is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, from which it declared independence in 1991. It became a member of the United Nations in 1993, but, as a result of an ongoing dispute with Greece over the use of the name \\"Macedonia\\", was admitted under the provisional description the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (sometimes unofficially abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia), a term that is also used by international organizations such as the European Union, the Council of Europe and NATO.\\n\\n- Montenegro (or or ; Montenegrin: \\"Crna Gora\\" /   , meaning \\"Black Mountain\\") is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\").\\n\\n- Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

It was located in the western part of the modern state of Greece. The city was founded by Caesar Augustus in commemoration of his victory in 31 BC over Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium nearby. It was soon made the major city of the wider region of Epirus region. Many impressive remains of the ancient city may be visited today.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n- The Strait of Otranto connects the Adriatic Sea with the Ionian Sea and separates Italy from Albania. Its width at Punta Palascìa, east of Salento is less than . The strait is named after the Italian city of Otranto.\\n\\n- The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.\\n\\n- Albanians are an ethnic group native to Albania and neighboring countries. The term is also used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania. Ethnic Albanians speak the Albanian language and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo. A large Albanian population lives in the Republic of Macedonia, with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro. The majority of Albanians are nominally Muslim (mainly Sunni, with a smaller Shia, Sufi and Bektashi component), and a minority are nominally Christian (Catholic and Orthodox). Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945-1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo. Outside the southwestern Balkans of where Albanians have traditionally been located, Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural, economic, social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too.\\n\\n- The Ionian Sea (, , ) is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea, south of the Adriatic Sea. It is bounded by southern Italy including Calabria, Sicily, and the Salento peninsula to the west, southern Albania to the north, and the west coast of Greece.\\n\\n- Ambracia (occasionally , \\"Ampracia\\"), was a city of ancient Greece on the site of modern Arta. It was founded as a Corinthian colony in the 7th century BC and was situated about 7 miles from the Ambracian Gulf, on a bend of the navigable river Arachthos (or Aratthus), in the midst of a fertile wooded plain.\\nHistory.\\nIt was founded between 650 and 625 BC by Gorgus, son of the Corinthian tyrant Cypselus, at which time its economy was based on farmlands, fishing, timber for shipbuilding, and the exportation of the produce of Epirus. After the expulsion of Gorgus's son Periander its government developed into a strong democracy. The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the Epirus trade), and its consequent aversion to Corcyra (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the Battle of Sybota, which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and Corinth).\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'ethnic group' with the subject 'dimitrios doulis'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- albanians\\n - croatia\\n - europe\\n - european\\n - greece\\n - greek\\n - greeks\\n - italy\\n - muslim\\n - yugoslav","target":"greeks","rationale":"The information above states that Dimitrios Doulis was a Greek military officer from Northern Epirus who was appointed to the post of Minister of Military Affairs.

It is part of the Lutheran branch of Christianity.\\n\\n- The Oulu Cathedral ( Finnish : Oulun tuomiokirkko ) is an Evangelical Lutheran cathedral and the seat of the Diocese of Oulu , located in the centre of Oulu , Finland . The church was built in 1777 as a tribute to the King of Sweden Gustav III of Sweden and named after his wife as Sofia Magdalena 's church . The wooden structures burned in the large fire of the city of Oulu in 1822 . The church was built again on top of the old stonewalls with famous architect Carl Ludvig Engel as the designer . The restoration works were completed in 1832 , but the belfry was not erected until 1845 .\\n\\n- The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.\\n\\n- A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.\\n\\n- A cathedra (Latin, \\"chair\\", from Greek,  \\"kathédra\\", \\"seat\\") or bishop's throne is the seat of a bishop. It is a symbol of the bishop's teaching authority in the Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion churches. \\"Cathedra\\" is the Latin word for a chair with armrests, and it appears in early Christian literature in the phrase \\"\\"cathedrae apostolorum\\"\\", indicating authority derived directly from the apostles; its Roman connotations of authority reserved for the Emperor were later adopted by bishops after the 4th century. A church into which a bishop's official \\"cathedra\\" is installed is called a cathedral.\\n\\n- The Diocese of Oulu is a diocese within the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. The diocese was first founded in the town of Kuopio in 1851, but the episcopal see was moved to Oulu in 1900.\\n\\n- The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.\\n\\n- Gustav III ( 29 March 1792) was King of Sweden from 1771 until his assassination in 1792. He was the eldest son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Queen Louise Ulrika (a sister of King Frederick the Great of Prussia), and a first cousin of Empress Catherine the Great of Russia by reason of their common descent from Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin, and his wife Albertina Frederica of Baden-Durlach.\\n\\n- A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).\\n\\n- Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp-Eutin (11 January 1673  24 April 1726) was a cadet of the reigning ducal House of Holstein-Gottorp who became prince of Eutin, prince-bishop of Lübeck and regent of the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp.\\n\\n- Duomo is a term for an Italian cathedral church. The formal Italian word for a church that is now a cathedral is \\"cattedrale\\"; a \\"duomo\\" may be either a present or a former cathedral (the latter always in a town that no longer has a bishop nor therefore a cathedral, as for example Trevi).

However, if we consider all actions from scenario 2, then we can see that Hannah had moved the green pepper from red_crate to red_bottle and subsequently left it there. This action does not match how Jayden has interacted with objects earlier in scenario 2: Jayden has consistently moved objects into his hands and out of a room before moving them elsewhere (for example see how he moves lettuce from blue_suitcase into bathroom).

She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly.

He noticed that elands, which is a prey animal, are basically nocturnal. On the other hand, wild boars, another prey animal, are not nocturnal.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which species would be more active at night, elands or wild boars?","target":"elands","rationale":"Given the background information, it can be inferred that animals will become nocturnal if their habitat leads to a higher chance of becoming prey. Elands live in African Savannah which is open and therefore has more predation risk than wild boars who forage discretely inside burrows. Therefore, elands are likely to be more active at night because they might have been forced into this behavior by natural selection due to these factors mentioned above (mainly avoidance of being caught as prey)."},{"source":"The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \\nQuestion: In addition to repairing 150 miles of airport runways, what other impact would this plan have on air traffic? \\nIs it The nation's air traffic control system would be modernized in an effort to reduce delays and travel time?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The president's plan would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time.\\n\\n\\nSo, the answer is Yes."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a sentence and a question, you would be asked to create the answer which is contained in the sentence provided.\\n\\nSentence: Are thunderstorms more likely extremely high the ground temperatures are extremely high or extremely low.

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \\"This award came as a real surprise to me. It is truly an honor. Just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro bono process was somewhat humbling. \\nWhat did L. Mark Bailey do after he graduated from Indiana University-Indianapolis? \\nWould it be good to answer \\"He worked as a clerk\\"?","target":"No","rationale":"The context of the passage says that Bailey received a Jurisprudence Doctorate. A juris doctor is a professional law degree, so it stands to reason that he would begin practicing as an attorney rather than working as a clerk after graduating from Indiana University-Indianapolis.\\nSo, the answer is \\"No\\"."},{"source":"In this task you are given an anecdote.

This is more because my little brother (12y/o) adores him, my brother is fantastic at basketball and his dad's a great coach for him and even though I don't get sports I think he genuinely has a future in it, he just got invited to his first national tournament. Okay now that the background is out of the way here's the situation.\\n\\nSo about 3 months ago I got a letter from the local power company saying that I was 1,000 dollars in debt to them from 2013, but here's the thing I was 13 at the time. So I called them to figure out what happened and once they told me the street address I immediately recognized it belonged to my old step dad. Obviously I was furious, so I talked to my mom about it to make sure she didn't give him permission to do anything like this, because he's a great manipulator and that was about the time they were thinking of getting back together (they didn't) and she assured that she would never let something like that happen and she was just finding out about it as well\\n\\nMy mom called him and told him to either pay the debt or have it put back into his name. But the problem with that is he's currently living out of a tent in a friend's backyard so I know for a fact he won't be able to pay it but once it's out out of my name it's not my problem. He tells her that he'll do it and I thought that was that\\n\\nYesterday I call the power company so I can make sure that this won't affect my credit or anything because I have no idea how that works and it's better to be safe than sorry seeing as how I'm planning on moving out in the next couple of months. So after asking her to check my name in their system the lady asks me \\"How would you like to pay your debt?\\" and  I was LIVID (obviously I didn't take this out on her shes just doing her job) and I explained that I was minor at the time and she transfers me over to the debt collectors agency and after explaining that I was minor to a 2nd woman she helps me file a letter of dispute. But then she tells me that the power company may require me to file a police report and name anyone who I might think is a suspect if I want this to be taken out of my name.\\n\\nIt's hard because when I was his exact age my dad started drinking heavily and fell out of my life and that was hard one me. I don't want my little brother to go through that too, seeing as how this is punishable by up to 5 years in prison where we live. We're also super close, the kid is genuinely one of my best friends and I don't want him to resent me even if his dad doesn't end up getting jail time.

Cedric looked over from where he was sitting on a lab stool, chewed thumbnail between his teeth. His shoulder length blond hair was coated with the shine of someone who has only wet their hair down and not washed. His red streaked eyes were a sure sign of his having been recently woken up. He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \\"Hook her up,\\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue.

Passage 1:At Dark Horse Comics, Grant wrote several limited and ongoing series in the short-lived Dark Horse shared superhero continuity, including the entire two-year run of the series X. His creation Enemy, published by Dark Horse, was optioned and produced as a Fox pilot, but ultimately did not air. He wrote numerous stories for DC Comics in the 1990s and created new versions of Manhunter and the Challengers of the Unknown. He continued to periodically write for Marvel Comics, his last major contribution being X-Man in collaboration with Warren Ellis and Ariel Olivetti. Among his other creator-owned works of the 1990s were the superhero comic Edge, with Gil Kane, published by Malibu Comics/Bravura, and the crime series Damned with Mike Zeck, published by WildStorm.\\n Passage 2:He made only a handful of appearances at the Britannia Stadium in 2003–04, though he earned a £50,000 move to Bristol City in the January transfer window. He played in the play-off final defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, replacing defender Tony Butler on 88 minutes as manager Danny Wilson made a late attempt to save the game. He did not feature heavily at Ashton Gate and instead was loaned out to Port Vale in October 2004. The next month Swansea City manager Kenny Jackett was on the lookout for a quality winger, Goodfellow meanwhile was prepared to go out on loan to the League Two club. Jackett managed to persuade City to allow Goodfellow to join the \\"Swans\\" on loan. He impressed at the Welsh club and his loan spell was extended the following month. However, he was quickly recalled to Ashton Gate after a spate of injuries at the Bristol club. Soon after Swansea attempted to buy Goodfellow off City, however, City manager Brian Tinnion informed Goodfellow he still had a future at the club. Tinnion was expecting at least what they paid Stoke for him and Swansea were unable to comply. In March 2005 he joined Colchester United on loan until the end of the season and scored once against Peterborough United.\\n Passage 3:Although there is no evidence of lower or middle Paleolithic settlements in Tripura, Upper Paleolithic tools made of fossil wood have been found in the Haora and Khowai valleys. The Indian epic, the Mahabharata; ancient religious texts, the Puranas; and the Edicts of Ashoka – stone pillar inscriptions of the emperor Ashoka dating from the third century BCE – all mention Tripura. An ancient name of Tripura is Kirat Desh (English: \\"The land of Kirat\\"), probably referring to the Kirata Kingdoms or the more generic term Kirata. However, it is unclear whether the extent of modern Tripura is coterminous with Kirat Desh. The region was under the rule of the Twipra Kingdom for centuries, although when this dates from is not documented. The Rajmala, a chronicle of Tripuri kings which was first written in the 15th century, provides a list of 179 kings, from antiquity up to Krishna Kishore Manikya (1830–1850), but the reliability of the Rajmala has been doubted.","target":"3","rationale":"The question asks which passage can be used to answer a particular question.

She kept these little books after all the others had gone back.  She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts.  It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it.  She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins.  She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back.  Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office.  Then the children came in; Deanie was half sick; and in the distress of getting the ailing child comfortably into her own bed, Johnnie forgot the books.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house.

Given the constant rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, treatment failure is increasingly frequent. In this context, innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Stimulation of innate immune cells in the respiratory tract [via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)] is an attractive approach for rapidly activating the body's immune defenses against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Previous studies of the TLR5 agonist flagellin in animal models showed that standalone TLR stimulation does not result in the effective treatment of pneumococcal respiratory infection but does significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of concomitant antibiotic treatment. Here, we investigated the antibacterial interaction between antibiotic and intranasal flagellin in a mouse model of pneumococcal respiratory infection. Using various doses of orally administered amoxicillin or systemically administered cotrimoxazole, we found that the intranasal instillation of flagellin (a dose that promotes maximal lung pro-inflammatory responses) induces synergistic rather than additive antibacterial effects against antibiotic-susceptible pneumococcus. We next set up a model of infection with pneumococcus that is resistant to multiple antibiotics in the context of influenza superinfection. Remarkably, the combination of amoxicillin and flagellin effectively treated superinfection with the amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcus since the bacterial clearance was increased by more than 100-fold compared to standalone treatments. Our results also showed that, in response to flagellin, the lung tissue generated an innate immune response even though it had been damaged by the influenza virus and pneumococcal infections. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the selective boosting of lung innate immunity is a conceptually advantageous approach for improving the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment and fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","target":"Therapeutic Synergy Between Antibiotics and Pulmonary Toll-Like Receptor 5 Stimulation in Antibiotic-Sensitive or -Resistant Pneumonia","rationale":"The title should provide evidence for the synergistic antibacterial effects of intranasal flagellin and antibiotic treatment in a mouse model of pneumococcal respiratory infection.

General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over Finland, and about his planned attack on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks and capture Russian Karelia. The Germans opposed these plans due to their peace treaties with Lenin. The Civil War weakened the Finnish Parliament; it became a Rump Parliament that included only three socialist representatives. On 9 October 1918, under pressure from Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, Friedrich Karl, the brother-in-law of German Emperor William II, to become the King of Finland. The German leadership was able to utilise the breakdown of Russia for the geopolitical benefit of the German Empire in Fennoscandia also. The Civil War and the aftermath diminished independence of Finland, compared to the status it had held at the turn of the year 1917-1918. The economic condition of Finland deteriorated drastically from 1918; recovery to pre-conflict levels was achieved only in 1925. The most acute crisis was in food supply, already deficient in 1917, though large-scale starvation had been avoided that year. The Civil War caused marked starvation in southern Finland. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, $8,033/ha and $13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

She got engaged to her boyfriend in late-2016 and everything was going great until she started getting cold feet in mid-2017. Once that started, she became very distant to her friends, would bail on our plans, wouldn't reply to messages, etc. My husband, Chad, and I have been married since 2015. My husband has this friend from high school- let's call him Zach. Chad and Zach were the best of friends during and in the years after high school and then kind of fell off of communicating after about 2007 when they moved to different states. We aren't close with June's bf/fiancé at all. He's a fine person, but not part of our regular group of friends. \\n\\nWhile June is getting cold feet, she strikes up a friendship with Zach that grows into an affair. During that time Chad and I reconnected with Zach and we all got really close. We have a ton of common interests and he's a great, attentive friend. Zach was really into June- he has genuine feelings for her and it seemed like June reciprocated. I thought they were going to get together for awhile. Long story short- June decides to break it off with Zach in early-2018 and go through with getting married to her fiancé about 8 months later. (btw: her fiancé knew all about it and they worked through it on their own and they seem happy now.) But Chad and I keep hanging out with Zach. June comes back to her friends but she's still kind of distant. I can tell that she doesn't like me hanging out with Zach but him and my husband are best friends- I can't avoid him so she seems to accept that. She doesn't ever directly confront me about this, by the way. She's pretty passive about these messages that I've inferred. \\n\\n**Current events #1**\\n\\nZach was also high school friends with some of mine and June's other friends and since he reconnected with us, they've gotten to be friends again, too. Right before the wedding in summer 2018- Zach and some of these other friends decided they wanted to party and catch up. We all decide to meet at mine and Chad's house because it's convenient and a fun space for a party. Obviously we didn't invite June- not that we were hiding it from her, we just didn't think it was necessary to run it by her. Well, she found out and confronted us. She got drunk and texted me a lot of hurtful things that night. I didn't respond at all and she apologized the next morning saying that she was too drunk and didn't mean it. She was mostly mad at me- not so much anyone else. We kind of talked it out but more so swept it under the rug and moved on. Things got better- I thought we were all in a good place again. My group of girlfriends were back to seeing each other regularly (June not so much, she's still kind of in and out but she's not as distant as before). We all manage to have a really fun time when we're together. \\n\\n**Current events #2**\\n\\nLast weekend Zach invited me, Chad, and two of June's other friends to a concert and we all went. It was a really good time! But then June found out the next day and again got drunk and texted a bunch of confrontational messages to all of us. (Again, not trying to hide anything from her.) Some things she mentioned in the messages-- he was manipulative, he continues to be manipulative, he tried to ruin her relationship, he is trying to ruin her life. Now she isn't speaking to any of us. I texted her once asking to explain what she meant and to please talk to me. No word back yet- it's been about a day. \\n\\n**Am I the asshole?**\\n\\nJune seems to think so but I don't understand where she's coming from. I think she is being more of an asshole than anyone in this horrible situation. I don't expect her to *like* me or anyone else hanging out with Zach but I feel like she is 1) avoiding any personal responsibility she has in the situation, placing all of the onus on Zach, and 2) is being unreasonable by expecting me to drop Zach out of loyalty to her when she has been a fair-weather friend for the past couple of years. \\n\\nI've tried to keep this as objective as possible.

As each molecule of sap enters a leaf and evaporates (a process called transpiration), the entire chain is pulled up a notch. So a negative pressure created by water evaporation must be present to pull the sap up through the xylem vessels. In most situations, fluids can push but can exert only negligible pull, because the cohesive forces seem to be too small to hold the molecules tightly together. But in this case, the cohesive force of water molecules provides a very strong pull. Figure 11.36 shows one device for studying negative pressure.

One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Brett and Scott were both studying bacteria for their exam.

Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ...

He was the illegitimate son of the famous actor, Junius Brutus Booth, an Englishman, who named Edwin after Edwin Forrest and Thomas Flynn, two of Junius' colleagues. He was the elder brother of John Wilkes Booth, himself a successful actor who gained notoriety as the assassin of President Lincoln. Nora Titone, in her book My Thoughts\\n\\nIn early appearances, Booth usually performed alongside his father, making his stage debut as Tressel or Tressil in Colley Cibber's version of Richard III in Boston in 1849. His first appearance in New York City was in the character of Wilford in The Iron Chest, which he played at the National Theatre in Chatham Street, on the 27th of September 1850. A year later, on the illness of the father, the son took his place in the character of Richard III.  After his father's death in 1852, Booth went on a worldwide tour, visiting Australia and Hawaii, and finally gaining acclaim of his own during an engagement in Sacramento, California, in 1856.  Before his brother assassinated Lincoln, Edwin had appeared with his two brothers, John Wilkes and Junius Brutus Booth Jr., in Julius Caesar in 1864. John Wilkes played Marc Antony, Edwin played Brutus, and Junius played Cassius. It was a benefit performance, and the only time that the three brothers appeared together on the same stage. The funds were used to erect a statue of William Shakespeare that still stands in Central Park just south of the Promenade. Immediately afterwards, Edwin Booth began a production of Hamlet on the same stage, which came to be known as the \\"hundred nights Hamlet\\", setting a record that lasted until John Barrymore broke the record in 1922, playing the title character for 101 performances.  From 1863 to 1867, Booth managed the Winter Garden Theatre in New York City, mostly staging Shakespearean tragedies. In 1863, he bought the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia.  After John Wilkes Booth's assassination of President Lincoln in April 1865, the infamy associated with the Booth name forced Edwin Booth to abandon the stage for many months. Edwin, who had been feuding with John Wilkes before the assassination, disowned him afterward, refusing to have John's name spoken in his house.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.\\n\\n- Startin' with Me is the debut album of country music artist Jake Owen, released in July 2006 (see 2006 in country music) on RCA Records Nashville.

Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.","target":"drowning","rationale":"In this passage, the author discusses various aspects of law and punishment in ancient Egypt.

We examined whether an intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss would decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among such patients.   \\n METHODS In 16 study centers in the United States, we randomly assigned 5145 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes to participate in an intensive lifestyle intervention that promoted weight loss through decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity (intervention group) or to receive diabetes support and education (control group). The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for angina during a maximum follow-up of 13.5 years.   \\n RESULTS The trial was stopped early on the basis of a futility analysis when the median follow-up was 9.6 years. Weight loss was greater in the intervention group than in the control group throughout the study (8.6% vs. 0.7% at 1 year; 6.0% vs. 3.5% at study end). The intensive lifestyle intervention also produced greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin and greater initial improvements in fitness and all cardiovascular risk factors, except for low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The primary outcome occurred in 403 patients in the intervention group and in 418 in the control group (1.83 and 1.92 events per 100 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio in the intervention group, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.09; P=0.51).   \\n CONCLUSIONS An intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on weight loss did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes.

Researchers are finding that, if approached the right way, there can actually be an advantage.\\nPsychologists classify envy in two ways: negative and positive. With positive envy, you are motivated by another person's success and struggle to follow it. With negative envy, you want to cut the advantaged person down so you look better by comparison. Let's say you feel sufferings of envy after your rival  at another firm gets promoted. Negative envy might drive you to destroy his success, but positive envy would inspire you to work harder and get promoted, too.\\nStudies show positive envy can be a great motivator . In a 2011 study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, researchers in the Netherlands conducted a series of experiments with more than 200 university students. Researchers found that when they caused feelings of positive envy----as opposed to admiration or negative envy----in the students, it drove them to want to study more and perform better on a test measuring creativity and intelligence. While admiration may feel better, the researchers found, it doesn't motivate performance like the pain and frustration of envy.\\n\\"Those painful sufferings of envy are there for an evolutionary  reason,\\" says Texas Christian University researcher Sarah E. Hill, \\"warning us that someone has something of importance to us.\\" Building on this theory, Dr. Hill and others conducted a series of experiments, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, to test whether envy improves attention and memory----the tools needed to copy a rival's steps to success. In one experiment, half of the participants were asked to recall past feelings of envy; the other half weren't. The two groups were then shown mock  interviews of imaginary peers. The group filled with envy paid closer attention and better recalled details about the interview subjects. In other words, envy made them more astute . Not only can envy motivate us to reach for higher goals,...\\nQuestion: What's the benefit of positive envy?\\nOptions: A: It inspires you to find a possible rival to try to defeat them.\\nB: It encourages you to work harder with a positive attitude.\\nC: It won't hurt your opponents in the same firm.\\nD: It won't destroy your success at another firm.","target":"B","rationale":"The article mentions that envy, when approached the right way, can actually have benefits.

Passage 1:In the course of the French occupation of the lands on the Rhine’s left bank in the wake of the Treaty of Lunéville, Rhaunen was grouped into the Department of Sarre, the arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the canton of Rhaunen. After the French withdrew in 1814, Rhaunen found itself in Prussia’s new Rhine Province, also becoming the seat of a Bürgermeisterei (“mayoralty”) in the Bernkastel-Kues district. Parts of the old high court district, however – Bundenbach, for instance – now belonged to the Principality of Birkenfeld, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea. Even after the First World War, through the Weimar Republic and on through the time of the Third Reich, Rhaunen was the administrative seat for the surrounding villages. In the course of administrative restructuring in the 1960s, the Amt of Rhaunen became the Verbandsgemeinde of Rhaunen in the Birkenfeld district. This arrangement still stands.\\n Passage 2:Laskov joined the Haganah as a teenager, and served in various units, including Orde Wingate's Special Night Squads.

He served in various capacities, and was a commander of the Jewish Brigade which saw action on the Italian front, eventually reaching the rank of major. After the war, he remained in Europe to participate in the Aliyah Bet illegal immigration effort to bring refugee Jews to Palestine. He also took part in various illicit acts of vengeance against the Nazis and their collaborators. Upon eventually returning to Palestine, he rejoined the Haganah, while also working as chief of security for the electric company.\\n Passage 3:He was arrested on 3 August 1944 at the Gare Montparnasse, and questioned harshly by the Gestapo at the Rue des Saussaies. He lost consciousness under the beatings but did not divulge any names; he was subsequently held at Fresnes Prison. Debeaumarché was one of the so-called \\"77,000\\" (named for the prisoners' numbers, between 76,000 and 78,000), Fresnes prisoners who were transported by train from Pantin to Buchenwald on 15 August 1944. He was moved to the underground factory of Mittelbau-Dora which produced V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, and posing as an electrical engineer was put to work in the manufacture of the V-1. Maurice Naegelé, a Kapo in the tunnel assembly section, gained the trust of Debeaumarché by relating details of the resistance movement in France. In fact Naegelé had been an agent of the Gestapo, before his deportation. Naegelé denounced Debeaumarché to SS-Oberscharführer Sander, head of surveillance at Mittelbau-Dora. Debeaumarché was arrested with others (including Naegelé) on the night of 3–4 November 1944. They were taken to the Niedersachswerfen SD headquarters, where Naegelé attempted to beat confessions out of the other prisoners. Debeaumarché was sentenced to death on 11 November 1944, but the sentence was not carried out. Instead Debeaumarché was held in solitary confinement, accused of anti-Nazi plotting.

The introduction of the Ford Mustang in early 1964 had, however, challenged the Thunderbird's market positioning. It, like the Thunderbird, was a small, two-door, four-seater with sporting pretensions, but it was substantially cheaper. The Thunderbird's sales suffered. Ford's response was to move the Thunderbird upmarket. For 1967 the Thunderbird would be a larger car, moving it closer to Lincoln as the company chose to emphasize the \\"luxury\\" part of the \\"personal luxury car\\" designation.

Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication.

Freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals originated in Scotland around 1600 and spread first to England and then across the Continent in the eighteenth century. They fostered new codes of conduct – including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability – \\"liberty, fraternity, and equality\\" Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism. Freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France – by 1789, there were perhaps as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations. The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies. Similar societies, partially imitating Freemasonry, emerged in France, Germany, Sweden and Russia. One example was the \\"Illuminati\\" founded in Bavaria in 1776, which was copied after the Freemasons but was never part of the movement.

The Dolphins responded swiftly as Trent Green and Ronnie Brown led the team on a three-minute drive that culminated on a one-yard run by Brown to tie the score at seven. However, the Jets wasted little time reclaiming the lead. Leon Washington received the ensuing kickoff at the two-yard line and returned it 98&#160;yards for a touchdown and a 14-7 lead. The Dolphins crept back with field goals of 31 and 39&#160;yards by Jay Feely on their next two possessions. Pennington kept the Dolphins at bay with a successful two-minute drill, finding tight end Chris Baker on a four-yard touchdown to close the first half and give the Jets a 21-13 halftime lead. The Jets attempted to further their lead opening the third quarter, but were stopped short of the goal line and had to settle for a 21-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Dolphins tried to respond, but the Jets' defense forced their first takeaway of the season on the ensuing drive, an interception by Kerry Rhodes. Pennington led his offense downfield with the help of several Thomas Jones running plays before he ran into the end zone to give the Jets a 31-13 lead early in the fourth quarter. Miami would not go down quietly, however. Green quickly marched the Dolphins downfield to set up Brown's two-yard touchdown run. The Dolphins elected to attempt a two-point conversion to cut their deficit to ten; using a Statue of Liberty play, Brown walked into the end zone to complete the conversion. Although the Jets shed several minutes off the clock on their following possession, the Dolphins got the ball back and again were able to move swiftly downfield, where Brown scored his third touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Green. The Dolphins needed to recover an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff to have a chance to tie or win the game, but, despite a penalty moving the ball up ten yards, were unsuccessful, and Pennington knelt out the clock to give the Jets their first victory of the season.\\n\\nHow many of Brown's touchdowns were running plays, not passing?","target":"2","rationale":"To answer how many of Brown's touchdowns were running plays, not passing, we first need to find out what kind of play each touchdown was.

I told her the number one thing is just being honest with me. I tried to drive home the point that I wouldn’t judge or fault her if she was just honest. \\n\\nFast forward to the day in class. We’d previously been riffing about some issues about her being dishonest about her dealings with a guy. She had deleted texts, lied about him being gay and overall had not been up front with me and tried to white lie her way out of the situation when I asked who he was (as I had never heard about him). She immediately goes into a defensive shut down when I ask about him (visually upset and frustrated). So I simply left. I got up and talked to friends at the other side of class just trying to give her some space to calm down. They ask me what happened, since they saw the fit she threw. I simply answered that I was discussing things that didn’t up with her. No accusations or statements that she cheated. Things just didn’t add up. I told them nothing that I didn’t know for fact. \\n\\nLater that day my phone blows up with people from a group chat I used to be in calling me a bully and a bad boyfriend. She refused to communicate with me for a good 30 minutes and it took a lot to even get her to talk to me. I explained to her that I wasn’t making fun of her and that I wasn’t upset about her friendship with another man, just her dishonesty about it. But she paints me as this humiliating dickhead and bully for discussing my feelings with classmates I trust. She thinks I’m telling everyone she cheated (which is not true).

Patients who had received thrombolytic therapy were excluded. Patients were divided into four groups depending on the status of the left anterior descending artery and the presence or absence of a left ventricular aneurysm: Group I (n = 25): aneurysm with occluded left anterior descending artery; Group II (n = 27): no aneurysm and occluded left anterior descending artery; Group III (n = 23): no aneurysm and patent left anterior descending artery; and Group IV (n = 4): aneurysm with patent left anterior descending artery. Single vessel disease was more common in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Groups II and III (no aneurysm) (chi 2(4) = 12.8; probability value equal to 0.012). Collateral blood supply in the presence of an occluded left anterior descending artery was significantly less in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Group II (no aneurysm) (0.9 versus 2.4, p less than 0.001). The extent of coronary artery disease and collateral blood supply in Groups I and II were directly related (p = 0.012). Neither age, sex nor risk factors for coronary disease correlated with aneurysm formation. At a mean follow-up of 48 months, no differences were observed in the incidence of recurrent angina, new myocardial infarction, embolic events or sudden death. More patients in Group II underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery in association with inherent poor collateral blood supply is a significant determinant of aneurysm formation after anterior myocardial infarction. Multivessel disease with either good collateral circulation or a patent left anterior descending artery is uncommonly associated with the development of left ventricular aneurysm. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes multiple numerical values that are highlighted in bold.

We conducted a multicenter phase II trial of panobinostat combined with bevacizumab in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG).   \\n METHODS Patients with recurrent HGG were treated with oral panobinostat 30 mg 3 times per week, every other week, in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every other week. The primary endpoint was a 6-month progression-fee survival (PFS6) rate for participants with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Patients with recurrent anaplastic glioma (AG) were evaluated as an exploratory arm of the study.   \\n RESULTS At interim analysis, the GBM arm did not meet criteria for continued accrual, and the GBM arm was closed. A total of 24 patients with GBM were accrued prior to closure. The PFS6 rate was 30.4% (95%, CI 12.4%-50.7%), median PFS was 5 months (range, 3-9 months), and median overall survival (OS) was 9 months (range, 6-19 months). Accrual in the AG arm continued to completion, and a total of 15 patients were enrolled. The PFS6 rate was 46.7% (range, 21%-73%), median PFS was 7 months (range, 2-10 months), and median OS was 17 months (range, 5 months-27 months).   \\n CONCLUSIONS This phase II study of panobinostat and bevacizumab in participants with recurrent GBM did not meet criteria for continued accrual, and the GBM cohort of the study was closed.

Passage:Watters played for ten seasons in the NFL with San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Seattle. He was selected by San Francisco in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft, but sat out the entire 1991 season with injuries. He started at running back for the 49ers during the next three seasons and San Francisco's offense led the NFL in scoring and yardage each year. The 49ers reached the NFC Championship Game in 1992 and 1993, falling both times to the Dallas Cowboys, before finally vanquishing Dallas in the 1994 NFC title game on their way to a Super Bowl championship. In a January 1994 divisional playoff, Watters set an NFL postseason record with five rushing touchdowns in the game, as the 49ers trounced the New York Giants 44-3. In Super Bowl XXIX the following season, Watters scored three touchdowns in San Francisco's 49-26 victory over the San Diego Chargers, tying a Super Bowl mark shared by fellow 49ers Roger Craig and Jerry Rice, and later matched by Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos.","target":"He was selected by San Francisco in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft, but sat out the entire 1991 season with injuries","rationale":"The question asks for the first draft pick the year Watters was drafted in the second round.

The Patriots came in looking for their sixth straight win. After forcing the Colts to a quick three-and-out, the Patriots scored on their opening drive of the game, covering 89 yards, in 11 plays scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run by rookie Jonas Gray. The Colts responded, aided by a 46-yard completion from Luck to T. Y. Hilton, driving to the Patriots 13, but had to settle for an Adam Vinatieri 31-yard field goal to bring the score to 7-3. The Patriots then drove to their own 49, but safety Mike Adams intercepted a pass intended for Tyms at the Colts 6 for no gain. On their next possession, the Colts reached the Patriots 32, but McCourty intercepted Luck and returned it 10 yards back to the Patriots 32. From there the Patriots struck on an 11-play, 68-yard drive, scoring on Gray's 2-yard touchdown run, extending the lead to 14-3. The Patriots forced a three-and-out, but on the third play of the Patriots next drive, Brady was intercepted by Adams again, who returned it 10 yards to the Patriots 23. With the fabulous field position, it took the Colts just three plays for Luck to find Hakeem Nicks on a 10-yard touchdown pass, making the score 14-10 with less than a minute remaining in the first half. After taking the kickoff, the Patriots restarted with an 8 play, 80-yard drive scoring on a  2-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, extending the lead to 21-10. The Colts drove to the Patriots 40 on their next drive, and Vinatieri was good from 53 yards away to trim the deficit to 21-13. The Patriots struck with another touchdown, with Brady passing for 56 yards on a 10-play, 80-yard drive before Gray scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and increasing the Patriots lead to 28-13. The Colts pulled back into the game on their next drive, with Luck completing 5 passes on the next drive for 77 yards, capping it off with his 1-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Castonzo, pulling the game back to 28-20. Despite the effort from Luck and the offense, the Colt defense had no answer for the Patriots, with them driving 80 more yards in 10 more plays, scoring on Gray's 1-yard touchdown run, his fourth, increasing the lead to 35-20 with just 8:43 remaining. The Colts actually stuffed Gray for a two-yard loss at the Colts 31 which would've made it 4th-and-4, but a 15-yard face mask penalty on Jerrell Freeman moved the ball to the 14 and Gray scored 4 plays later. Four straight incompletions gave the Patriots the ball at the Colts 32. After two three-yard runs by Gray, Tom Brady threw a short pass to Gronkowski who broke it off for a 26-yard touchdown, effectively ending the game and clinching the Patriots' sixth straight win. The game also saw several skirmishes between Gronkowski and Sergio Brown, with Gronkowski throwing Brown into an NBC camera after the play on Gray's 4th touchdown. Gronkowski referred to this incident as throwing Sergio Brown \\"out of the club\\" for talking trash all game, including posting Gronk's stats on Twitter during the game. Jonas Gray broke out, running all over the Colts for 201 yards and 4 touchdowns on 37 carries. Tom Brady threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns, but threw two interceptions. The Patriots scored on every drive of the second half with exception of their final drive of the game which was used to run out the clock. Luck threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns, but the running game was a non-factor, totaling just 19 yards on 16 carries, with Trent Richardson running 6 times for 0 yards.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home.

Hanna meant that Cobain smelled like the deodorant Teen Spirit, which his then-girlfriend Tobi Vail wore. Cobain said he was unaware of the deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted it as a revolutionary slogan, as they had been discussing anarchism and punk rock.\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was, along with \\"Come as You Are\\", one of several songs written following Nirvana's first recording sessions with producer Butch Vig in 1990.

When he presented the song to his bandmates, it comprised just the main guitar riff  and the chorus vocal melody, which bassist Krist Novoselic dismissed as \\"ridiculous\\". In response, Cobain made the band play the riff for an hour and a half. Eventually, Novoselic began playing the riff more slowly, inspiring drummer Dave Grohl to create the drum beat. As a result, it is the only song on Nevermind to credit all three band members as writers.Prior to the Nevermind recording sessions, the band sent Vig a cassette demo of song rehearsals including \\"Teen Spirit\\".

These tests may include blood tests, an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart), and/or a chest X-ray. Dr. Leslie Kernisan is the author of a popular blog and podcast at BetterHealthWhileAging.net. She is also a clinical instructor in the University of California, San Francisco, Division of Geriatrics. Atrial fibrillation, also sometimes called A-fib, is usually diagnosed with an electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure that uses electrodes taped to the skin on the chest to measure the electrical activity within the heart. This information creates a tracing, which can be printed on paper or viewed on a monitor. Occasionally atrial fibrillation is noticed incidentally on an ECG or other heart test. More commonly, doctors order an ECG because a person is having symptoms that could be caused by atrial fibrillation, such as palpitations, a racing heartbeat, dizziness, or shortness of breath. Transtelephonic monitor: When you develop symptoms of atrial fibrillation, a strip of your current heart rhythm can be transmitted to your doctor’s office over the telephone, using a monitor with two bracelets or by placing the monitor against your chest wall. How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed? The most commonly used tests to diagnose atrial fibrillation include: Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): The ECG draws a picture on graph paper of the electrical impulses traveling through the heart muscle. An EKG provides an electrical “snapshot” of the heart. For people who have symptoms that come and go, a special monitor may need to be used to capture the arrhythmia. Holter monitor: A small external recorder is worn over a short period of time, usually one to three days. Diagnosing AFib: EKG Your doctor will diagnose atrial fibrillation on an electrocardiogram (EKG). This heart tracing shows a distinct pattern in the electricity of the heart that your doctor can diagnose. If your AFib comes and goes you may need to wear a continuous heart monitor (Holter monitor) to diagnose the abnormal rhythm. Some of the tests used for making an atrial fibrillation diagnosis include: 1  Electrocardiogram (EKG) 2  Holter monitor. 3  Event monitor. 4  Echocardiogram. 5  Blood tests, including thyroid tests. 6  Electrophysiology study (EPS). Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common type of abnormal heart rhythm. Atrial fibrillation or AF can lead to serious heart complications like stroke. Learn about diagnosing and treating AFib. Atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for stroke. About 15 percent of all people who have strokes have AFib. Because of the irregular and chaotic flow of blood through the heart, small blood clots can form in the heart chambers when you have atrial fibrillation. These clots can travel through the bloodstream to the brain, causing a stroke. As part of the medical history, the healthcare provider will ask a number of questions, including questions about: 1  Current symptoms. 2  Medical conditions. 3  Current medications. 4  Family history of medical conditions. 5  Social history, including alcohol use and smoking.

Rolling Stone writer Greil Marcus asked \\"What is this shit?\\" on first listening to Self Portrait, released in June 1970. It was a double LP including few original songs, and was poorly received. In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, considered a return to form. This album included \\"Day of the Locusts\\", a song in which Dylan gave an account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970. In November 1968, Dylan had co-written \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" with George Harrison; Harrison recorded \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" and Dylan's \\"If Not for You\\" for his 1970 solo triple album All Things Must Pass. Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh attracted media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock, a small studio in Greenwich Village, to record with Leon Russell. These sessions resulted in \\"Watching the River Flow\\" and a new recording of \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\". On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded \\"George Jackson\\", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin State Prison that year. Dylan contributed piano and harmony to Steve Goodman's album, Somebody Else's Troubles, under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas (referencing the play Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas and his own previous name) in September 1972.In 1972, Dylan signed to Sam Peckinpah's film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, providing songs and backing music for the movie, and playing \\"Alias\\", a member of Billy's gang with some historical basis. Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" became one of Dylan's most covered songs.Also in 1972, Dylan protested the move to deport John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who had been convicted of possessing cannabis, by sending...","target":"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid","rationale":"The paragraph gives the history of Dylan's movie career.

The DFO infusion caused rises in plasma Al levels (regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated Al) in patients undergoing HD. Plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain. Examination of Al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma Al content passed through HD membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms/l, and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of Al as well as DFO than the conventional one. Although a 1:1 complex between DFO and Al in an aqueous solution was confirmed, the formation of Al-rich complexes in vivo was suggested.

He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings, in particular half-timbering, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, pargeting, and the use of decorative brick in diapering and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of joinery and highly detailed wood carving.\\nThroughout his career he attracted commissions from wealthy landowners and industrialists, especially the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion.

Sister company Red Star Line handled traffic between America and the European continent, primarily through Antwerp, Belgium. The company's most prominent president was Clement Griscom, who led the company from 1888 to 1902 and worked as a company executive for its entire existence. During its existence, the company was the largest American shipping company, rivalled only by the smaller, Baltimore-based Atlantic Transport Lines, although this distinction is a marginal one, as all American oceanic shipping concerns were dwarfed by British companies such as the White Star Line or Cunard Line and German ones such as HAPAG.\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus.

The generation born between 1980 and 2001 grew up playing sports where scores and performance were played down because \\"everyone's winner.\\" And their report cards sounded more positive   than ever before. As a result, Stanford University professor Carol Dweck, PhD, calls them \\"the overpraised generation.\\"\\nDweck has been studying how people deal with failure for 40 years. Her research has led her to find out two clearly different mind-sets that have a great effect on how we react to it. Here's how they work:\\nA fixed mind-set is grounded in the belief that talent   is genetic - you're a born artist, point guard, or numbers person. The fixed mind-set believes it's sure to succeed without much effort and regards failure as personal shame. When things get difficult, it's quick to blame, lie, and even stay away from future difficulties.\\nOn the other hand, a growth mind-set believes that no talent is entirely heaven-sent and that effort and learning make everything possible. Because the ego   isn't on the line as much, the growth mind-set sees failure as a chance rather than shame. When faced with a difficulty, it's quick to rethink, change and try again. In fact, it enjoys this experience.\\nWe are all born with growth mind-sets. (Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to live in the world.) But parents, teachers, and instructors often push us into fixed mind-sets by encouraging certain actions and misdirecting praise. Dweck's book, Mind-set: The New Psychology of Success, and online instructional program explain this in depth.

In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they believe is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300 million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.\\n\\nWith what type of insect is a dicondylic mandible associated?","target":"winged","rationale":"The context of the article tells us that a dicondlylic mandible is an important characteristic in insects.

Beyonce's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former back up dancer for Destiny's Child.\\n\\nJody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \\"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\\". Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \\"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\\". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonce's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \\"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\\"  Beyonce's music is generally R&B, but she also incorporates pop, soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyonce's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyonce recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyonce was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.  She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts. Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \\"Independent Women\\" and \\"Survivor\\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \\"Cater 2 U\\". Beyonce has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.  In 2001, she became the first black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards. Beyonce was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs (\\"Irreplaceable\\", \\"Grillz\\" and \\"Check on It\\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine song-writing credits on number-one singles. (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song \\"I Was Here\\" for 4.) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyonce at number 17 on their list of the \\"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters\\", for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan.

Passage:A modulated radio wave, carrying an information signal, occupies a range of frequencies. See diagram. The information (modulation) in a radio signal is usually concentrated in narrow frequency bands called sidebands (SB) just above and below the carrier frequency. The width in hertz of the frequency range that the radio signal occupies, the highest frequency minus the lowest frequency, is called its bandwidth (BW). A given amount of bandwidth can carry the same amount of information (data rate in bits per second) regardless of where in the radio frequency spectrum it is located, so bandwidth is a measure of information-carrying capacity. The bandwidth required by a radio transmission depends on the data rate of the information (modulation signal) being sent, and the spectral efficiency of the modulation method used; how much data it can transmit in each kilohertz of bandwidth. Different types of information signals carried by radio have different data rates. For example, a television (video) signal has a greater data rate than an audio signal.\\n Links: a.

The quarterly dividend will be payable on August 3, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 6, 2009. If I decide to buy more shares on July 6th and sell July 7th, am I still going to receive the dividends? Or do I have to hold it till Aug 3? Thanks. If you are in a tax bracket above 15%, then your long-term capital gains are taxed at a rate that is lower than your ordinary rate. If, however, you sell an investment that you have held for a year or less, the gains are taxed at your regular rate. Best Answer: You only need to hold a stock for  one day to earn the dividend. But in your example you would not get the dividend. You need to buy before the ex-div date to get the dividend. If you buy before ex-div date and sell on or after the ex-div date, you get the dividend. An investor should hold a short sell position for as long as the investment is profitable and as long as the investor can reasonably expect the profits to increase. However, there are a number of additional factors that can influence a short seller's decision on when to close out his investment. Short sellers must have an awareness of the increased risk level involved in selling short as opposed to buying long. An investor buying a stock can only sustain a maximum loss of 100% of his or her investment, but a short seller, while having a maximum potential profit of 100%, faces virtually unlimited risk given that a stock price can theoretically rise to infinitely higher prices. The aim is to hold onto the short until the price of the stock drops, enabling the investor to buy back the borrowed amount of shares at a lower price and realize a profit from the short sell transaction, but interest charges must be figured into net profit. Best Answer: You only need to hold a stock for one day to earn the dividend. But in your example you would not get the dividend. You need to buy before the ex-div date to get the dividend. If you buy before ex-div date and sell on or after the ex-div date, you get the dividend. There are four dates related to dividends. So, if you sell a stock, you will need to pay taxes on the gains. The good news is, that you don’t have to pay taxes on this type of income until you sell and lock in the gains. As you make the decision about whether or not to sell a stock, it can help to consider whether or not your gains are considered long term or short-term. Long-Term Gains versus Short-Term Gains. The amount of time you hold an investment matters when figuring what you owe in terms of taxes. If you hold something for a year or less, it is considered a short-term investment. On the other hand, if you hold a stock for more than a year (one year plus one day), it is considered long-term. Understanding this is vital as you consider taxes, since short-term capital gains are taxed as regular income, and long-term capital gains have their own tax rates. The company pays because of having the money/investment for a time period. If you sell on July 7th you will have nothing to do with that stock and no payment will be made. These stocks are all on the brokers records which your on the brokers record, but not the company. So the money will go to the broker.

The first stage, known as sensitization, usually starts in childhood, and is marked by the child's becoming aware of same-sex attractions. The second stage, identity confusion, tends to occur a few years later. In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners. In the third stage of identity assumption, which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a self-definition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. In the final stage, known as commitment, the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle.

John Pontifex was a carpenter; his son George rises in the world to become a publisher; George's son Theobald, pressed by his father to become a minister, is manipulated into marrying Christina, the daughter of a clergyman; the main character Ernest Pontifex is the eldest son of Theobald and Christina.\\nThe author depicts an antagonistic relationship between Ernest and his hypocritical and domineering parents. His aunt Alethea is aware of this relationship, but dies before she can fulfill her aim of counteracting the parents' malign influence on the boy. However, shortly before her death she secretly passes a small fortune into Overton's keeping, with the agreement that once Ernest is twenty-eight, he can receive it.\\nAs Ernest develops into a young man, he travels a bumpy theological road, reflecting the divisions and controversies in the Church of England in the Victorian era. Easily influenced by others at university, he starts out as an Evangelical Christian, and soon becomes a clergyman. He then falls for the lures of the High Church (and is duped out of much of his own money by a fellow clergyman). He decides that the way to regenerate the Church of England is to live among the poor, but the results are, first, that his faith in the integrity of the Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one of the poor he was hoping to redeem, and, second, that under the pressures of poverty and theological doubt, he attempts a sexual assault on a woman he had incorrectly believed to be of loose morals.\\nThis assault leads to a prison term. His parents disown him. His health deteriorates.\\nAs he recovers he learns how to tailor and decides to make this his profession once out of prison. He loses his Christian faith. He marries Ellen, a former housemaid of his parents, and they have two children and set up shop together in the second-hand clothing industry. However, in due course he discovers that Ellen is both a bigamist and an alcoholic. Overton at this point intervenes and pays Ellen a stipend, and she happily leaves with another for America. He gives Ernest a job, and takes him on a trip to Continental Europe.\\nIn due course Ernest becomes 28, and receives his aunt Alethea's gift. He returns to the family home until his parents die: his father's influence over him wanes as Theobald's own position as a clergyman is reduced in stature, though to the end Theobald finds small ways purposefully to annoy him.

The other three Eukarya kingdoms are the Fungi, Plant, and Animal Kingdoms. The Protist Kingdom is hard to define. It includes many different types of organisms. You can see some examples of protists in Figure 9.1. The Protist Kingdom includes all eukaryotes that dont fit into one of the other three eukaryote kingdoms. For that reason, its sometimes called the trash can kingdom. The number of species in the Protist Kingdom is unknown. It could range from as few as 60,000 to as many as 200,000 species. For a beautiful introduction to the amazing world of protists, watch this video: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. If so, they must have evolved from prokaryotes. How did this happen? How did cells without organelles acquire them? What was the origin of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles? The most likely way organelles evolved is shown in Figure 9.2. First, smaller prokaryotic cells invaded, or were engulfed by, larger prokaryotic cells. The smaller cells benefited by getting nutrients and a safe place to live. The larger cells benefited by getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the smaller cells. Eventually, the smaller cells evolved into organelles in the larger cells. After that, neither could live without the other. Despite the diversity of protists, they do share some traits. The cells of all protists have a nucleus. They also have other membrane-bound organelles. For example, all of them have mitochondria, and some of them have chloroplasts. Most protists consist of a single cell. Some are multicellular but they lack specialized cells. Most protists live in wet places. They are found in oceans, lakes, swamps, or damp soils. Many protists can move. Most protists also have a complex life cycle. The life cycle of an organism is the cycle of phases it goes through until it returns to the starting phase. The protist life cycle includes both sexual and asexual reproduction. Why reproduce both ways? Each way has benefits. Asexual reproduction is fast. It allows rapid population growth when conditions are stable. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variation. This helps ensure that some organisms will survive if conditions change. Protists are classified based on traits they share with other eukaryotes. There are animal-like, plant-like, and fungus- like protists. The three groups differ mainly in how they get carbon and energy. Animal-like protists are called protozoa (protozoan, singular). Most protozoa consist of a single cell. Protozoa are probably ancestors of animals. Protozoa are like animals in two ways: 1. Protozoa are heterotrophs. Heterotrophs get food by eating other organisms. Some protozoa prey on bacteria. Some are parasites of animals. Others graze on algae. Still others are decomposers that break down dead organic matter. 2. Almost all protozoa can move. They have special appendages for this purpose. You can see different types in Figure 9.3. Cilia (cilium, singular) are short, hair-like projections. Pseudopods are temporary extensions of the cytoplasm. Flagella are long, whip-like structures. Flagella are also found in most prokaryotes. Plant-like protists are commonly called algae (alga, singular). Some algae consist of single cells. They are called diatoms. Other algae are multicellular. An example is seaweed. Seaweed called kelp can grow as large as trees. You can see both a diatom and kelp in Figure 9.4. Algae are probably ancestors of plants. Algae are like plants mainly because they contain chloroplasts. This allows them to make food by photosynthesis. Algae are important producers in water-based ecosystems such as the ocean. On the other hand, algae lack other plant structures. For example, they dont have roots, stems, or leaves. Also unlike plants, some algae can move. They may move with pseudopods or flagella. Fungus-like protists include slime molds and water molds, both shown in Figure 9.5.
