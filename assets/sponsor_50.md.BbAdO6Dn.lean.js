It is famous for the House of 1000 Mirrors.\\nA small, happy little dog learned of this place and decided to visit. When he arrived, he jumped happily up the stairs  to the doorway  of the house. He looked through the doorway with his ears lifted high  and his tail  wagging  as fast as it could. To his great surprise, he found himself looking at 1000 other happy little dogs with their tails wagging just as fast as his. He smiled a great smile, and was answered with 1000 great smiles just as warm and friendly. As he left the house, he thought to himself, \\"This is a wonderful place. I will come back and visit often.\\"\\nIn the same village, another little dog, who was not quite as happy as the first one, decided to visit the house. He slowly climbed the stairs and hung  his head low as he looked into the door. When he saw the 1000 unfriendly-looking dogs looking back at him, he _ at them and was afraid to see 1000 little dogs growling back at him. As he left, he thought to himself, \\"That is a terrible place. I will never go back there again.\\"\\nAll the faces in the world are mirrors.

The band built a considerable following, especially in the British counterculture, notably with their albums The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, and Wee Tam and the Big Huge. They became pioneers in psychedelic folk and, through integrating a wide variety of traditional music forms and instruments, in the development of world music. Following Palmer's early departure, Williamson and Heron performed as a duo, later augmented by other musicians.\\n\\n1968 was the band's annus mirabilis with the release of their two most-celebrated albums, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter and the double LP Wee Tam and the Big Huge (issued as two separate albums in the US). Hangman's reached the top 5 in the UK album charts soon after its release in March 1968 and was nominated for a Grammy in the US. Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin said his group found their way by playing Hangman's and following the instructions. A departure from the band's previous albums, the set relied heavily on a more layered production, with imaginative use of the then new multitrack recording techniques. The album featured a series of vividly dreamlike Williamson songs, such as \\"The Minotaur's Song\\", a surreal music-hall parody told from the point of view of the mythical beast, and its centrepiece was Heron's \\"A Very Cellular Song\\", a 13-minute reflection on life, love and amoebas, its complex structure incorporating a Bahamian spiritual (\\"I Bid You Goodnight\\"). Williamson and Heron in this album had added their girlfriends, Licorice McKechnie and Rose Simpson, to the band to contribute additional vocals and various instruments, including organ, guitar and percussion. Despite their initially rudimentary skills, Simpson swiftly became a proficient bass guitarist, and some of McKechnie's songs were recorded by the band.  By early 1968 the group were capable of filling major venues in the UK. They left behind their folk club origins and embarked on a nationwide tour incorporating a critically acclaimed appearance at the London Royal Festival Hall. Later in the year they performed at the Royal Albert Hall, at open-air festivals, and at prestigious rock venues, such as the Fillmore auditoriums in San Francisco and New York. After their appearance at the Fillmore East in New York they were introduced to the practice of Scientology by David Simons (aka \\"Rex Rakish\\" and \\"Bruno Wolfe\\", once of Jim Kweskin's Jug Band). Joe Boyd, in his book White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s and elsewhere, described how he was inadvertently responsible for their \\"conversion\\" when he introduced the band to Simons, who, having become a Scientologist, persuaded them to enrol in his absence. The band's support for Scientology over the next few years was controversial among some fans and seemed to coincide with what many saw as the beginning of a decline in the quality of their work. In an interview with Oz magazine in 1969 the band spoke enthusiastically of their involvement with it, although the question of its effect on their later albums has provoked much discussion ever since.  Their November 1968 album Wee Tam and the Big Huge, recorded before the US trip, was musically less experimental and lush than Hangman's but conceptually even more avant-garde, a full-on engagement with the themes of mythology, religion, awareness and identity. Williamson's otherworldly songs and vision dominate the album, though Heron's more grounded tracks are also among his very best, and the contrast between the two perspectives gives the record its uniquely dynamic interplay between a sensual experience of life and a quest for metaphysical meaning. The record was released as a double album and also simultaneously as two separate LPs, a strategy which lessened its impact on the charts.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"The Incredible String Band","rationale":"The given context is obviously about the band The Incredible String Band."},{"source":"Q: What covers the body of a fish to help the move their body to swim?\\n\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- gelatin\\n\\n- skin\\n\\n- hairs\\n\\n- scales\\n\\nA:","target":"scales","rationale":"A fish's scales are its outer covering, which is made from the same material as human hair and fingernails.

The Steelers forced a punt on the Ravens' first drive before the Steelers offense produced a 16-play, 84-yard drive which took up 10 minutes and 23 seconds of game time and led to a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal, making the score 3-0. This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6-0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13-0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19-0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19-3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19-9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26-9. The Steelers moved into sole possession of first place in the AFC North with the victory while the team improved to 3-1.  The team would win their 6th straight game against a divisional opponent. The victory marked the first time that the Steelers defeated the Ravens in Baltimore since 2012.  It would also be Roethlisberger's first win in Baltimore since 2010. Pittsburgh also scored the most points in Baltimore of any Steelers team since 2002. Seventeen points marked the largest margin of victory for the Steelers in Baltimore in series history, and the largest such margin against any team in Baltimore since the Steelers defeated the Colts in Memorial Stadium by twenty-six points in the 1976 NFL Playoffs.\\n\\nHow many yards longer was Chris Boswell's second field goal compared to his first?","target":"19","rationale":"Chris Boswell made his first field goal from 30 yards and second field goal from 49 yards.

People would much rather hear a sermon about forgiveness than one about Hell.\\nEverybody wanted to be forgiven. But when it came to forgiving others--many people fight it.

How many times had he already forgiven his father? But he knew that 'seventy times seven' did not mean literally 490 times. The number 'seven' in the Bible symbolized completeness.

The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.\\n Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.\\n Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.","target":"3","rationale":"The question asks for the number of kings Hungary had before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law, which can be answered by Passage 3. The first sentence indicates that Philippe was in the service of Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was a king.

Therefore, there should have been one more king before him and his father-in-law (Joanna I)."},{"source":"You are given a conversation between two people.

Passage 1:The Eagles of the Empire series centres upon two main protagonists, Quintus Licinius Cato and Lucius Cornelius Macro, who are both Roman soldiers. Macro, a veteran with nearly 15 years' service (at the start of the first novel) in the Roman Army, has recently been appointed to the Centurionate. Cato is in his teen years, grew up in the Imperial Palace as a slave, and at the start of the series joins the Eagles as Macro's Optio. The first book starts in 42 AD. The books cover the experiences of the two soldiers, initially as experienced centurion and new optio, in battles in Germania and the invasion of Britain by Claudius as part of the Legio II Augusta. The 6th book The Eagle's Prophecy has them serving as part of the Imperial Navy east of Italy. The 7th and 8th put them in Rome's eastern provinces as agents of the Emperor's secretary Tiberius Claudius Narcissus. The 9th sees them shipwrecked on the island of Crete, fighting against a full-scale uprising. The 11th is set in Rome with the leads hoping to save the emperor from the shady Liberators. The Blood Crows is set once again in Britannia. The two protagonists are faced with defeating tribal rebels.\\n Passage 2:Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the Maeda clan were confirmed as daimyō of Kaga Domain, which included most of Etchū Province. Maeda Toshinaga, the son of Maeda Toshiba and second daimyō of Kaga Domain rebuilt the castle and temporarily used it as his retirement home until much of it burned down in 1609. His grandson, Maeda Toshitsugu was awarded a 100,000 koku holding in Etchū Province in 1639, the forming Toyama Domain; however, initially his fief did not include Toyama Castle. Unable to raise funds to build his own castle, in 1659 he reached an agreement with Kaga Domain to exchange some of holdings for Toyama Castle and the surrounding lands. In 1661, he received permission from the Tokugawa shogunate to rebuild the castle and to lay out a new castle town. His descendants ruled over Toyama from here until the Meiji Restoration. Many of the structures of the castle and its rampant were destroyed by the 1858 Hietsu earthquake, and most of what survived was destroyed by order of the new Meiji government in 1871.\\n Passage 3:One of the later signings of the summer was goalkeeper Len Hill, who joined from Queens Park Rangers in June 1925. Regular keeper Tommy Allen had turned down a new contract at the club, leading to the signing of Hill as his replacement. Allen later agreed to new terms in October and returned to his place as first-choice Southampton goalkeeper, with Hill making sporadic appearances later in the season. Transfer activity continued throughout the season. In December 1925 the club signed inside-forward Jim Swinden from Salisbury City, following a trial in which he scored two goals on his debut for the reserve side against Folkestone. In March 1926, right-half Bill Adams joined from Southern League side Guildford United. Needing money to purchase the freehold of The Dell, Southampton sold mainstay full-backs Fred Titmuss and Tom Parker in early 1926 – the former in February to Plymouth Argyle for £1,750; the latter in March to Arsenal for £3,250 – which \\"caused uproar amongst supporters\\".","target":"1","rationale":"The information in Passage 1, \\"The first book starts in 42 AD.

A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.\\n\\n- Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.\\n\\n- A bardic name is a pseudonym used in Wales, Cornwall or Brittany by poets and other artists, especially those involved in the eisteddfod movement.\\n\\n- In Welsh culture, an eisteddfod (plural \\"eisteddfodau\\" ) is a Welsh festival of literature, music and performance. The tradition of such a meeting of Welsh artists dates back to at least the 12th century, when a festival of poetry and music was held by Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth at his court in Cardigan in 1176, but the decline of the bardic tradition made it fall into abeyance. The current format owes much to an 18th-century revival arising out of a number of informal eisteddfodau. The closest English equivalent to \\"eisteddfod\\" is \\"session\\"; the word is formed from two Welsh morphemes: \\"eistedd\\", meaning \\"sit\\", and \\"bod\\", meaning \\"be\\". In some countries, the term eisteddfod (plural often \\"eisteddfods\\") is used for certain types of performing arts competitions that have nothing to do with Welsh culture.\\nHistory.\\nThe date of the first eisteddfod is a matter of much debate among scholars but boards for the judging of poetry existed in Wales from at least the early 12th century. These judging boards had probably derived from ancient Celtic bardic traditions. The first recorded eisteddfod was held under the auspices of The Lord Rhys at Cardigan Castle in 1176. There he held a gathering to which were invited poets and musicians from all parts of Wales. A chair at the Lord's table was awarded to the best poet and musician, a tradition that prevails in the modern day National Eisteddfod. The earliest large-scale eisteddfod that is historically known is the Carmarthen Eisteddfod in 1451 under Thomas ap Gruffydd of Llandeilo (his illegitimate son was the soldier Rhys ap Thomas). \\n\\n- Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom. It is bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea, to the south by the English Channel, and to the east by the county of Devon, over the River Tamar. Cornwall has a population of and covers an area of . The administrative centre, and only city in Cornwall, is Truro, although the town of Falmouth has the largest population for a civil parish and the conurbation of Camborne, Pool and Redruth has the highest total population.\\n\\n- Owen Wynne Jones ( 4 March 1828 -- 4 April 1870 ) , often known by his bardic name of Glasynys , was a Welsh clergyman and author . Owen Wynne Jones was born at a house called Ty'n - y - ffrwd , in the village of Rhostryfan , near Caernarfon . At the age of ten , he was sent to work in the quarry , but later returned to full - time education and went on to train as a teacher . In 1855 he began teaching at Llanfachreth in Merionethshire . He began to assist Eben Fardd in arranging local eisteddfodau . In 1860 he was ordained as an Anglican clergyman and worked as a curate in several parishes . He wrote many articles and co-edited the periodical Y Glorian with William Thomas ( Islwyn ) .\\n\\n- A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'owen wynne jones'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- musician\\n - poet\\n - superhero\\n - united kingdom","target":"poet","rationale":"Owen Wynne Jones was a Welsh clergyman and author who went by the pseudonym Glasynys.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Big town and Fair town both used petroleum products.

Sometimes, especially when it is storming spooky sounds can be heard that scare George and he has no idea what they are.\\n\\nWhen it is storming, is George more or less likely to hear howling noises?\\n\\nHint: Wind causes the generation of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause a low level of environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.","target":"more","rationale":"When it is storming, George will be more likely to hear howling noises.

She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001.\\nContext: Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (nee Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \\"Rick\\" Hilton, is a businessman. She was raised in the Catholic faith. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \\"Nicky\\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. As a child, she was friends with other socialites, including Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian.  Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995-96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut from fall 1998 to February 1999 (her junior year), where she was a member of the ice hockey team. In February 1999, Hilton was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules, returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. She later earned a GED certification.  Hilton began modeling as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton said that she \\"wanted to model\\", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was \\"loving\\" the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her \\"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\\". In 2001, Hilton developed a reputation as a socialite; she was called \\"New York's leading It Girl\\", whose fame was beginning to \\"extend beyond the New York tabloids\\". Around that time she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and appeared on several magazine covers, including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the US' Vanity Fair and FHM. Hilton also appeared in Vincent Gallo's \\"Honey Bunny\\" video. In 2002, she played a lead role in the straight-to-video horror film, Nine Lives. According to Beyondhollywood.com, \\"Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast\\". The website noted that her character was, basically, herself: \\"Hilton plays--what else?--a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day.

The band helped to found a subgenre within German hard rock and metal that became known as Neue Deutsche Harte. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages including English, Spanish, French, and Russian.\\nContext: Rammstein started recording Sehnsucht in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. \\"Engel\\", the first single from the album, was released on 1 April 1997 and reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named Engel - Fan Edition. This contained two previously unreleased songs, \\"Feuerrader\\" and \\"Wilder Wein\\". Release of the second single from the album Sehnsucht was \\"Du hast\\", which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while Sehnsucht was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached number 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, Herzeleid and both Sehnsucht singles (\\"Du hast\\" and \\"Engel\\") were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold-out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for KMFDM. In August 1998, the band released a cover of the song Stripped, originally released by Depeche Mode in early 1986; it was included on the tribute album For the Masses, the Rammstein version obtained moderate success in Germany and Austria.  On 22-23 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band had played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, Live aus Berlin.  Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values Tour in September through to late October 1998. Continuing their success in the US, Sehnsucht received Gold record status there on November 2.  The band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for Best Rock Act and performed \\"Du hast\\" live on 12 November that year.  Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 41st-annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the Live aus Berlin concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, Live aus Berlin went to number one in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999 the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively.

Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.\\nTo create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.\\nFollowing the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company.

Because centuries ago forests were twice as many as what they are today. A hike into many of those woods will tell different stories, too--of diseases and insects that are slowly killing trees, of some forests that are burned by fire, of logging that local people do more often. Deforestation  and degradation   of the world's forests mainly harm the basic ability of those ecosystems   to function or provide services, such as fresh water, air, plants and animals, which benefit people everywhere and keep the balance of nature. \\nDeforestation\\nForests today are a small part of what they once were. Nearly half of the world's forest cover is gone, and each year 40 million acres more are cut and replaced by agriculture and development. Over the next 45 years, wood use in the world is guessed to increase by 50 per cent over its present rate. Many of the forests that remain are severely destroyed, which harms the ability to protect birds or wild animals, and to supply natural resources to people. Deforestation also brings about between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of all air pollution causing global climate change.\\nDegradation\\nForests continue to be degraded by some uses such as the gathering of wood for fuel, the arrival of pests and diseases that kill trees, the effects of climate change and poor management such as the fire, flood and so on.\\nQuestion: How many forests will be cut if we don't take measures after ten years?\\nOptions: A: About 300 million acres of forests.\\nB: About 30 million acres of forests.\\nC: About 40 million acres of forests.\\nD: About 400 million acres of forests.","target":"D","rationale":"The article mentions that wood use in the world is expected to increase by 50% over its present rate.

Over ten years this would mean a total of 600 million acres lost.\\nHowever, because half of all forests have already been cut down according to the first paragraph, there are 400 million remaining. So after 10 years only 200 out these remaining 400 millions would remain or be left today - and so we can conclude that after ten years about 400 (out of 800)million acre  will be cut down .

Recently, knockout mice deficient in the CB1 cannabinoid receptor have been generated, and these animals result in an excellent tool to evaluate the neurophysiology of the endogenous cannabinoid system. Objectives: To establish the role of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in several emotional-related behavioural responses, including aggressiveness, anxiety, depression and learning models, using CB1 knockout mice. Methods: We evaluated the spontaneous responses of CB1 knockout mice and wild-type controls under different behavioural paradigms, including the light/dark box, the chronic unpredictable mild stress, the resident–intruder test and the active avoidance paradigm. Results: Our findings showed that CB1 knockout mice presented an increase in the aggressive response measured in the resident–intruder test and an anxiogenic-like response in the light/dark box. Furthermore, a higher sensitivity to exhibit depressive-like responses in the chronic unpredictable mild stress procedure was observed in CB1 knockout mice, suggesting an increased susceptibility to develop an anhedonic state in these animals. Finally, CB1 knockout mice showed a significant increase in the conditioned responses produced in the active avoidance model, suggesting an improvement of learning and memory processes.

By the end of 1961, Dion had become a major star, touring worldwide and making an appearance in the Columbia Pictures musical film Twist Around the Clock. He followed with a string of singles - \\"Lovers Who Wander\\" (No. 3), \\"Little Diane\\" (No. 8), \\"Love Came to Me\\" (No. 10) - in 1962, several of which he wrote or co-wrote. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander.  At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records; he was the first rock and roll artist signed to the label, which was an anomaly considering that its then-A&R director, Mitch Miller, passionately loathed that particular genre of music. The first Columbia single, Leiber and Stoller's \\"Ruby Baby\\" (originally a hit for the Drifters) reached No. 2, while \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" and \\"Drip Drop\\" (another remake of a Drifters hit) both reached No. 6 in late 1963. (Dion also recorded an Italian version of \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" using the identical backup vocals.) His other Columbia releases were less successful, and problems with his addiction and changing public tastes, especially The British Invasion, saw a period of commercial decline.

Scheduling a mandatory meeting on a day that works best for you, without asking about any ones availability, and knowing said meeting will take about an hour is offensive and inconsiderate of your employees lives outside this building.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nShe was taken aback.

The whole industrial process which makes many of the goods and machines we need and use in our daily lives,is bound to create a number of waste products which upset the environmental balance,or the ecological balance as is also known.Many of these waste products can be prevented or disposed of.But while more and more new and complex goods are produced,there will be new,dangerous waste to be disposed of,for example,the waste products from nuclear power stations.Many people,therefore,see pollution as only part of a larger and more complex problem,that is,the whole process of industrial production and consumption of goods.Others again see the problem mainly in connection with agriculture,where new methods are helping farmers grow more and more on their land to feed our ever-increasing population.However,the land itself is gradually becoming worn out as it is being used,in some cases,too heavily,and artificial fertilizers can not restore the balance. Whatever its underlying reasons are,there is no doubt that much of the pollution caused could be controlled if only companies,individuals and governments would make more efforts.In the home there is an obvious need to control litter and waste.Food comes wrapped up three or four times in packages that all have to be disposed of;drinks are increasingly sold in bottles or tins which can not be reused.This not only causes a litter problem,but also is a great waste of resources,in terms of glass,metals and paper.Advertising has helped this process by persuading many of us not only to buy things we neither want nor need,but also to throw away much of what we do buy.Pollution and waste combine to be a problem everyone can help to solve by cutting out unnecessary buying,excessive consumption and careless disposal of the products we use in our daily lives. \\n Question: Many people see pollution as only part of .","target":"the whole process of industrial production and consumption of goods","rationale":"There are multiple answers that are correct, however the shortest continuous span is \\"the whole process of industrial production and consumption of goods\\" which more concisely captures the meaning of the question."},{"source":"Read the article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: In the past,when people had problems,they went to their families or friends to get advice.Today it is possible to get advice from radio shows.TV programs or telephone hot lines,too.A hot line is a telephone line that offers a direct way of getting in touch with advicers.Most hot lines are completely anonymous --callers do not have to say their names or telephone numbers.Most hot lines are usually free,too.Callers do not have to pay for their advice or the phone calls--even if the calls are long distance.At some hot lines,the advicers are volunteers.Other hot lines pay their advicers for their work.Usually the advicers are full-job people with years of education and experience,but sometimes the advicers have only taken a short class before starting to work on the hot line.All the advicers listen to the people and help them solve their problems.\\nQuestion: The advicers working at hot lines  _  .\\nOptions: A: are not all paid\\nB: have all been trained for a short time\\nC: are all volunteers\\nD: all have years of education and experience","target":"A","rationale":"- A is not a possible answer because the article mentions that most hot line advicers are paid.\\n- B is not right either, since it says in the text that only some of them take short classes before starting to work while others have years of education and experience.\\n- C would be correct if there were no paid advicers but this information does not exist in the article; therefore option A is selected as the best response.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \`}</div>"},{"source":"I am hesitating between 4 options to answer the following question, which option should I choose?\\nQuestion: A chewable calcium carbonate tablet is a common treatment for stomach discomfort.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.\\n\\n- The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.

But new research using an artificial egg, which is equipped to measure heart rates, disputes this.  Scientists from the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge say that a slow moving human who does not approach the nest too closely, is not viewed as a threat by penguins.\\nThe earlier findings have been used to partly explain the 20 per cent drop in populations of certain types of penguins near tourist sites.  However, tour operators have continued to insist that their activities do not adversely affect wildlife in Antarctica, saying they encourage non-disruptive behavior in tourists, and that the decline in penguin numbers is caused by other factors.\\nAmanda Nimon of the Scott Polar Research Institute spent three southern hemisphere summers at Cuverville Island in Antarctica studying penguin behavior towards humans.  \\"A nesting penguin will react very differently to a person rapidly and closely approaching the nest,\\" says Nimon.  \\"First they exhibit large and prolonged heart rate changes and then they often flee the nest leaving it open for predators   to fly in and remove eggs or chicks.\\"  The artificial egg, specially for the project, monitored both the parent who had been 'disturbed' when the egg was placed in the nest and the other parent as they both took it in turns to guard the nest.\\nHowever, Boris Culik, who monitored the Adelie penguins, believes that Nimon's findings do not invalidate his own research.

Although xenobiotic responses have been studied in vertebrates, little effort has been made to exploit a simple genetic system for characterizing the molecular basis of this coordinated transcriptional response. We show here that approximately 1000 transcripts are significantly affected by phenobarbital treatment in Drosophila. We also demonstrate that the Drosophila ortholog of the human SXR and CAR xenobiotic receptors, DHR96, plays a role in this response. A DHR96 null mutant displays increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of phenobarbital and the pesticide DDT as well as defects in the expression of many phenobarbital-regulated genes. Metabolic and stress-response genes are also controlled by DHR96, implicating its role in coordinating multiple response pathways.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a $250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island.

She also appears in the comic book series based on the television show. Portrayed by Emma Caulfield, the character appears as a guest star in the third and fourth seasons of the show before becoming a series regular in the show's fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons.\\n\\nAnyanka arrives at Sunnydale High in 1998 (in the episode \\"The Wish\\") as a student named Anya Emerson. She's come to Sunnydale in response to the distress of Cordelia, who is upset after catching her boyfriend, Xander Harris, kissing their friend Willow. After some prompting, Cordelia states: \\"I wish that Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.\\" Anya shows her true demon face to Cordelia and says, \\"Done.\\" and the world changes. Now they're in an alternative reality in which Buffy has not come to Sunnydale and the vampire population has multiplied and gained in power. Giles meets with Cordelia before she dies and manages to discern what has happened. He subsequently summons Anyanka and destroys her necklace. As a result, Anya is made mortal again and the world returns to normal.  Caulfield said, \\"As far as I know, I don't think Joss Whedon ever intended to have Anya around for more than one episode.\\" However, Anya returns in the episode \\"Doppelgangland\\", duping Willow into assisting in a failed magical attempt to recover the necklace which was her power center, lost when Giles destroyed it to reverse the wish granted for Cordelia. When these efforts fail, she is forced to continue living as a typical high school student. Now with human feelings, she yearns to attend the school prom in spite of her abhorrence of all men; ironically, her only hope for a date is the last man she was sent to punish, Xander. Caulfield says, \\"[Whedon] found this great way to have her interact with the storylines that had developed throughout the entire [third] season.\\"  Anya develops feelings for Xander and asks him out again just before graduation. Her romantic plans are foiled when he tells her of the Mayor's plan for his own \\"Ascension\\", a transformation into pure demon, at the graduation ceremony. Anya decides to flee Sunnydale and invites Xander to join her, saying when she thinks something could happen to him, she \\"feels bad inside, like [she] might vomit\\". Xander refuses because he's got \\"friends on the line\\", and can't abandon them. She leaves without him.  Anya returns to Sunnydale early in Season Four, still infatuated with Xander. She seduces him (in the episode \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\"). Her lack of experience with people causes her to make straightforward, often tactless remarks, which soon put her at odds with other Scooby Gang members, especially Willow, who has little trust for the ex-demon. Anya's tactlessness is played both for humor and to highlight the truth in situations where others are reluctant to be frank. This is seen most poignantly in \\"The Body\\" when her inability to comprehend Buffy's mother's death leads to inappropriate remarks which at first make others angry, but then allow for catharsis and comfort.

She poses this as a question to me - but it's not really a question, it's an answer yes or I'll get teary eyed, pouty, and become a mute for the rest of the day.

He was known for his cartoons in the British press, and for his lifelong work to inform the general public about good buildings and architectural heritage. \\nThe only child of a prosperous family, Lancaster was educated at Charterhouse School and Lincoln College, Oxford, at both of which he was an undistinguished scholar. From an early age he was determined to be a professional artist and designer, and studied at leading art colleges in Oxford and London. While working as a contributor to The Architectural Review in the mid-1930s, Lancaster published the first of a series of books on architecture, aiming to simultaneously amuse the general reader and demystify the subject. Several of the terms he coined as labels for architectural styles have gained common usage, including \\"Pont Street Dutch\\" and \\"Stockbrokers' Tudor\\", and his books have continued to be regarded as important works of reference on the subject.\\nIn 1938 Lancaster was invited to contribute topical cartoons to The Daily Express. He introduced the single column-width cartoon popular in the French press but not until then seen in British papers. Between 1939 and his retirement in 1981 he drew about 10,000 of these \\"pocket cartoons\\", which made him a nationally known figure. He developed a cast of regular characters, led by his best-known creation, Maudie Littlehampton, through whom he expressed his views on the fashions, fads and political events of the day.\\nFrom his youth, Lancaster wanted to design for the theatre, and in 1951 he was commissioned to create costumes and scenery for a new ballet, Pineapple Poll. Between then and the early 1970s he designed new productions for the Royal Ballet, Glyndebourne, D'Oyly Carte, the Old Vic and the West End.

The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen.\\nThere was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling.

He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \\"Conrack\\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world.\\nConroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \\"what death would sound like\\".

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time.

His favorite toy is his bouncing ball. In Middle 1, Gray plays happily with his bouncing ball. This implies that he still has possession of his ball and can continue playing with it in this state as long as he likes. However, in Middle 2, Gray pops his bouncing ball which means that the condition of his favorite toy is no longer playable; therefore, he would not be able to continue playing with it after popping it (i.e., making a hole in it). As such, this makes more sense because there is no longer any reason for him to play happily if he cannot play at all afterward since the condition of the toy has been irreversibly changed by him popping (deflating) it.\\"\\n}"},{"source":"Write the conversation response.

Two explanations are commonly given for this alteration. One deduces a false etymology associated with the word virgo (\\"maiden\\" in Latin) due to Virgil's excessive, \\"maiden\\"-like modesty. Alternatively, some argue that Vergilius was altered to Virgilius by analogy with the Latin virga (\\"wand\\") due to the magical or prophetic powers attributed to Virgil in the Middle Ages (this explanation is found in only a handful of manuscripts, however, and was probably not widespread). In Norman schools (following the French practice), the habit was to anglicize Latin names by dropping their Latin endings, hence Virgil. In the 19th century, some German-trained classicists in the United States suggested modification to Vergil, as it is closer to his original name, and is also the traditional German spelling.[citation needed] Modern usage permits both, though the Oxford guide to style recommends Vergilius to avoid confusion with the 8th-century grammarian Virgilius Maro Grammaticus.

Detroit would tie the game up as QB Jon Kitna completed a 37-yard TD pass to RB Shawn Bryson.

The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city.

He is the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which owns the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, and is the parent company of Venetian Macao Limited, which operates The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. He also owns the Israeli daily newspaper Israel Hayom and the American daily newspaper Las Vegas Review-Journal. Adelson, a lifelong donor and philanthropist to a variety of causes, also founded the Adelson Foundation in 2007, at the initiative of his wife, Miriam.\\n\\nIn 2007, Adelson made an unsuccessful bid to purchase the Israeli newspaper Maariv. When this failed, he proceeded with parallel plans to publish a free daily newspaper to compete with Israeli, a newspaper he had co-founded in 2006 but had left. The first edition of the new newspaper, Israel Hayom, was published on July 30, 2007. On March 31, 2014, Adelson received the go-ahead from a Jerusalem court to purchase Maariv and the conservative newspaper Makor Rishon. In 2016 Adelson's attorney announced that he does not own Israel Hayom, it is owned by a relative of his.  According to a Target Group Index (TGI) survey published in July 2011, Israel Hayom, which unlike all other Israeli newspapers is distributed for free, became the number-one daily newspaper (on weekdays) four years after its inception. This survey found that Israel Hayom had a 39.3% weekday readership exposure, Yedioth Ahronoth 37%, Maariv 12.1%, and Haaretz 5.8%. The Yedioth Ahronoth weekend edition was still leading with a 44.3% readership exposure, compared to 31% for the Israel Hayom weekend edition, 14.9% for Maariv, and 6.8% for Haaretz. This trend was already observed by a TGI survey in July 2010.  In 2011, the Israeli press said that Adelson was unhappy with coverage of him on Israeli Channel 10, which alleged that Adelson had acquired a casino license in Las Vegas inappropriately through political connections. The channel apologized after Adelson threatened a lawsuit. This led to the resignations of the news chief, Reudor Benziman; the news editor, Ruti Yuval; and the news anchor, Guy Zohar, who objected to the apology. After two months of deliberations, the Israeli Second Authority for Television and Radio ruled that although there were some flaws in the manner in which the apology had been conducted, the decision to apologize had been correct and appropriate.\\n\\nWhat is Adelsons connection to the Israeli press?","target":"In 2007, Adelson made an unsuccessful bid to purchase the Israeli newspaper Maariv.","rationale":"This is a text completion question.

Incubation of macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in the conversion of [3H]25OHD3 to a more polar vitamin D3 metabolite (up to 15 pmol/10(6) cells). Untreated macrophages did not synthesize this metabolite. Several findings suggested that the metabolite was the biologically active form of vitamin D3, namely 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. (1) The metabolite comigrated with chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3 on four different high performance liquid chromatographic systems. (2) The metabolite had the same affinity for the chick intestinal 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor as authentic 1,25-(OH)2D3. (3) The biological activity of the macrophage metabolite in vivo (stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization in rachitic chicks) was identical to the activity of chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3. The LPS-stimulated synthesis of the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like compound by macrophages was dose dependent in a linear fashion; a half-maximal response was typically found with 100-200 ng LPS/10(6) cells. Polymyxin B abolished the effects of LPS on 25OHD3 metabolism in macrophages. Our data suggest that LPS-stimulated macrophages can modulate, on a local level, the function of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells by releasing the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like metabolite. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolism by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated normal human macrophages. option2: Lack of cold sensitivity in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.","target":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolism by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated normal human macrophages","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that measured the capacity of normal human pulmonary alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages to metabolize 25OHD3 after stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide.

These results suggested that LPS-stimulated macrophages could modulate, on a local level, the function of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells by releasing this metabolite. As such, Option1 describes the topic of this abstract better than Option2 (which is irrelevant).

He was soon performing in concerts in private homes. The Times critic reported after one such appearance that Grainger's playing \\"revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight\\".  In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a \\"love-serve job\\". She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced \\"an overpowering landslide\\" of feeling, and that \\"I thought I was about to die.

In October of that year he toured Britain in a concert party with Adelina Patti, the Italian-born opera singer. Patti was greatly taken by the young pianist and prophesied a glorious career for him. The following year he met the German-Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni. Initially the two men were on cordial terms (Busoni offered to give Grainger lessons free of charge) and, as a result, Grainger spent part of the 1903 summer in Berlin as Busoni's pupil.  However, the visit was not a success; as Bird notes, Busoni had expected \\"a willing slave and adoring disciple\\", a role Grainger was not willing to fulfill.

The band's current line-up comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Tim McIlrath, lead guitarist Zach Blair, bassist Joe Principe and drummer Brandon Barnes. Former members are guitarists Dan Wlekinski, Kevin White, Todd Mohney and Chris Chasse, and drummer Toni Tintari. The band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords, on which they released two studio albums, The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions per Minute (2003).\\nContext: After a year and a half of touring, Rise Against reconvened at the Blasting Room to record their fourth album, The Sufferer & the Witness. The band members were dissatisfied with Richardson's contributions to Siren Song of the Counter Culture, as he produced a more polished and heavier album than their previous works. As a result, they decided to return to Stevenson and Livermore, whom they felt had accurately captured the raw punk sound they strove for on Revolutions per Minute. Unlike the stressful recording sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture, the band had a much more enjoyable time with The Sufferer & the Witness, as they no longer sought the approval of Geffen executives. According to McIlrath: \\"It went great, the songs just flowed out of us. There were really few questions and the song lyrics would just come out of us, it went really well and everyone really liked them.\\"  The Sufferer & the Witness was released on July 4, 2006. The album sold 48,327 copies in its first week of release in the United States, and peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200. The Sufferer & the Witness also charted in seven other countries, including number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, making it the band's first album to chart outside of the United States. It was certified gold in three countries, and platinum by Music Canada. The album was well received by critics, who praised the production value, and noted how Rise Against was able to mature in their sound and simultaneously retain their punk roots.  Three songs from The Sufferer & the Witness were released as singles: \\"Ready to Fall\\", \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\", and \\"The Good Left Undone\\". These three songs also charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, with \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" and \\"The Good Left Undone\\" in particular peaking within the top ten. Rise Against supported the album with The Sufferer & the Witness Tour throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007. The band was a headliner on the 2006 Warped Tour, during which author and filmmaker Davy Rothbart recorded several of the band's live performances, and interviewed some of their fans. This footage was used in the Rise Against DVD documentary Generation Lost. In 2007, the band released the EP This Is Noise, and participated in a tour with My Chemical Romance. Prior to this tour, Chasse left the band, citing touring fatigue as the reason for his departure; Zach Blair of the band Only Crime joined shortly thereafter, as Rise Against's fifth different guitarist. At the time he received the call about joining Rise Against, Blair was a construction worker living paycheck to paycheck.\\nQuestion: Was the album popular?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"The Good Left Undone\\" in particular peaking within the top ten.","rationale":"The context states that the album was well received, and also mentions three songs from it being released as singles.

Originally described by Carl Stål , the type species is Psaltoda moerens known as the redeye , and P. plaga is a well - known species from eastern Australia , known as the black prince . Fifteen species are recognised . Relationships of the species with each other remains unclear .\\n\\n- The cicadas (or ) are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. It is divided into the Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 1,300 species described from around the world; many undescribed species remain.\\n\\n- Leafhopper is a common name applied to any species from the family Cicadellidae. These minute insects, colloquially known as hoppers, are plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs, or trees. Their hind legs are modified for jumping, and are covered with hairs that facilitate the spreading of a secretion over their bodies that acts as a water repellent and carrier of pheromones. They undergo a partial metamorphosis, and have various host associations, varying from very generalized to very specific. Some species have a cosmopolitan distribution, or occur throughout the temperate and tropical regions. Some are pests or vectors of plant viruses and phytoplasmas. The family is distributed all over the world, and constitutes the second-largest hemipteran family, with at least 20,000 described species.\\n\\n- Angophora is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, described as a genus in 1797. It is endemic to Australia, where species are distributed in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. The centre of diversity is along the northern and central coast of New South Wales.\\n\\n- The Auchenorrhyncha (former synonym: \\"Cicadinea\\") suborder of the Hemiptera contains most of the familiar members of what was called the Homoptera  groups such as cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, and spittlebugs. The aphids and scale insects are the other well-known \\"Homoptera\\", and they are in the suborder Sternorrhyncha. Lesser-known insects largely regarded as Homoptera are the Coleorrhyncha. However, the taxonomic status of the Hemiptera and Homoptera is currently under investigation and discussion. See Heteroptera and Prosorrhyncha for more information.\\n\\n- The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of Hemipteran insects, in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but they are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which encase themselves in froth in springtime.\\n\\n- South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. It covers some of the most arid parts of the country. With a total land area of , it is the fourth-largest of Australia's states and territories. It has a total of 1.7 million people, and its population is the most highly centralised of any state in Australia, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs. Other population centres in the state are relatively small.\\n\\n- Queensland (abbreviated as QLD) is the second-largest and third-most-populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia. Situated in the north-east of the country, it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,750,500, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Often referred to as the \\"Sunshine State\\", Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy. Tourism in the state, fuelled largely by its warm tropical climate, is a major industry.\\n\\n- Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.\\n\\n- The Tettigarctidae, also known as the hairy cicadas, are a small relict (mostly extinct) family of primitive cicadas, containing a single genus Tettigarcta, with two extant species, one in southern Australia (\\"Tettigarcta crinita\\"), and the other in Tasmania (\\"Tettigarcta tomentosa\\"). Fossil taxa include \\"Paratettigarcta zealandica\\" from New Zealand.\\n\\n- Eucalyptus L'Heritier 1789 is a diverse genus of flowering trees and shrubs (including a distinct group with a multiple-stem mallee growth habit) in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. Members of the genus dominate the tree flora of Australia, and include the tallest known flowering plant on Earth. There are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of New Guinea and Indonesia. One species, \\"Eucalyptus deglupta,\\" ranges as far north as the Philippines. Of the 15 species found outside Australia, just nine are exclusively non-Australian. Species of eucalyptus are cultivated widely in the tropical and temperate world, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, China, and the Indian subcontinent. However, the range over which many eucalypts can be planted in the temperate zone is constrained by their limited cold tolerance. Australia is covered by of eucalypt forest, comprising three quarters of the area covered by native forest.\\n\\n- Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.\\n\\n- Psaltoda moerens, commonly known as the redeye, is an Australian species of cicada. It is distributed through the south-east of Australia, from southern Queensland to South Australia, as well as Tasmania. Populations can vary greatly between years; one year they may be present in large numbers and the next they may be entirely absent. They feed primarily on eucalyptus but also on \\"Angophora\\" trees. As they feed on tree sap they expel small droplets of clear waste fluid. When numbers are high, this can form a constant stream.\\n\\n- The Hemiptera or true bugs are an order of insects comprising some 50,000 to 80,000 species of groups such as the cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, and shield bugs. They range in size from to around , and share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts. The name \\"true bugs\\" is sometimes limited to the suborder Heteroptera.

His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants.

One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.","target":"Andy","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that nitrogen fixating bacteria are involved in the process of acetogenesis, whereas non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes do not.

His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include  Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann  played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Darkover is the focus planet of the Darkover series of science fiction-fantasy novels and short stories by Marion Zimmer Bradley and others published since 1958.

It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, gothic novels, media tie-in novelizations, and romances. Ace became known for the \\"tête-bêche\\" binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this \\"Ace Double\\" format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound \\"tête-bêche\\", until 1973.\\n\\n- Spell of the Witch World is a collection of short fiction by science fiction and fantasy author Andre Norton, forming part of her Witch World series.

Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\\n\\n- A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that\\nThe term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion.

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'the keeper's price' with the relationship of 'series'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 2\\n - alice\\n - community\\n - darkover series\\n - fame\\n - fantasy\\n - fiction\\n - gothic\\n - life\\n - novel\\n - orbit\\n - supernatural\\n - the real world\\n - witch world","target":"darkover series","rationale":"The \\"Keeper's Price\\" is a book that forms part of the Darkover series, so darkover series is the answer.\\n\\"\\""},{"source":"Make toilet seat warm.

The study was conducted double-blind on 2 days, 1 week apart, using a placebo-controlled crossover design. On each day, measurements at rest were made before and 20 minutes after 20 mg sublingual nifedipine or placebo and were followed by measurements made during exercise. Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise. It did not alter mean pulmonary artery or pulmonary artery wedge pressures at rest, but decreased them during exercise. Nifedipine decreased arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) from 96 +/- 10 to 90 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at rest and from 99 +/- 11 to 92 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) at submaximal exercise (33 +/- 21 W), but did not alter it (100 +/- 12 versus 100 +/- 16 mm Hg, p = NS) at maximal exercise (68 +/- 30 W). The reduction in PaO2 was not due to alveolar hypoventilation, because nifedipine did not alter arterial carbon dioxide tension, or to changes in mixed venous oxygen tension, which nifedipine increased at rest (39 +/- 2 versus 43 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and during submaximal exercise (31 +/- 4 versus 33 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.03) and maximal exercise (27 +/- 3 versus 31 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Artificial Intelligence 2)Cerebral Ischemia, Transient 3)Decision Making, Computer-Assisted","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract describes a study in which the effect of nifedipine on arterial oxygenation and hemodynamics were measured at rest and during exercise.

It seems that these aggressive actions were taken by a 16 year old student towards his younger brother simply because he would not listen/comply with what they wanted (which was for him to stop playing Fortnite). This behavior is inappropriate and demonstrates that there may be other underlying issues within their relationship (possibly related to insecurity or jealousy). Therefore, it seems that while it may be true that they were unable sleep due to noise from their younger brother's gaming session, it does not justify responding with violence against them; instead of resorting immediately to physical force towards their younger sibling for failing comply with their request(s), perhaps next time they could try asking again more forcefully or even telling them outright why it bothers them so much if necessary (i.e., \\"\\"I'm trying sleep so please keep your voice down\\"\\").\\\\nBased on all these factors considered above (e.g., punching a sibling repeatedly in head when did something you didn't like), I agree with other commenters' assessment: yes, you're probably being an asshole here especially if your parents are aware of this behavior but haven't done anything about it yet.\\""},{"source":"Ask a question about Hyderabad.","target":"What sport is played at the Swarnandhra Pradesh Sports Complex?","rationale":"The context mentions that Hyderabad is famous for its sports facilities.

He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings.\\nEl Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis.

After two failed expeditions by the Arakanese navy to retake the port in 1604 and 1605, Arakan gave up its claims on the Lower Burma coastline. Arakan's Portuguese troubles were not yet over. In 1609, its northern territories at the edge of Ganges delta and off Chittagong came under threat by the Portuguese mercenaries and the Mughal government in Bengal. In March 1609, 400 Portuguese mercenaries, led by Sebastian Gonzales Tibao, seized the Sandwip island. Meanwhile, the Mughal governor of Bengal tried to take over Noakhali District. Min Yazagyi was forced to enter into an alliance with the Portuguese to drive out the Mughals. After the Mughals were driven out, Gonzales promptly seized the Arakanese navy, and began raiding as far south as Lemro river. Later, the Portuguese viceroy at Goa sanctioned an attack on Mrauk-U itself. In November 1615, a fleet of 14 Portuguese galliots and 50 smaller war boats led by Francis de Meneses sailed up the Lemro. Alas, the fleet was driven back by Arakanese defences, which included broadsides of a few Dutch ships.

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.\\n\\nParagraph: In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present.

The album was produced by Matthew Wilder and recorded in 11 studios in the Greater Los Angeles Area between March 1993 and October 1995. Between 1995 and 1998, seven singles were released from it, including \\"Just a Girl\\", which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart; and \\"Don't Speak\\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and reached the top five of many international charts.\\nThe album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, No Doubt earned nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. It has sold over 16 million copies worldwide, and was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States and Canada, platinum in the United Kingdom, and triple platinum in Australia. Tragic Kingdom helped to initiate the ska revival of the 1990s, persuading record labels to sign more ska bands and helping them to attract more mainstream attention. The album was ranked number 441 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\\nNo Doubt embarked on a tour to promote the album.

On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. \\n\\n- LeAnne Howe ( born April 29 , 1951 ) is an American author and Eidson Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at the University of Georgia , Athens .

Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone. Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic.\\n\\nQ: What are some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated?","target":"virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness","rationale":"The context explains that the characteristics of virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness should be considered when evaluating diseases.

It derives its name from the British explorer James Ross who visited this area in 1841. To the west of the sea lies Ross Island and to the east Roosevelt Island, while the southernmost part is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf, and is about from the South Pole.\\n\\n- New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\\n\\n- The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island.

Conceived by Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition was an attempt to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent. After the conquest of the South Pole by Roald Amundsen in 1911, this crossing remained, in Shackleton's words, the \\"one great main object of Antarctic journeyings\\". The expedition failed to accomplish this objective, but became recognised instead as an epic feat of endurance.\\n\\n- A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".\\n\\n- Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited.

It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.\\n\\n- The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.\\n\\n- Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.\\n\\n- Victoria Land is a region of Antarctica which fronts the western side of the Ross Sea and the Ross Ice Shelf, extending southward from about 70°30'S to 78°00'S, and westward from the Ross Sea to the edge of the Antarctic Plateau. It was discovered by Captain James Clark Ross in January 1841 and named after the UK's Queen Victoria. The rocky promontory of Minna Bluff is often regarded as the southernmost point of Victoria Land, and separates the Scott Coast to the north from the Hillary Coast of the Ross Dependency to the south.\\n\\n- The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.\\n\\n- The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.\\n\\n- The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.\\n\\n- Marie Byrd Land is the portion of West Antarctica lying east of the Ross Ice Shelf and the Ross Sea and south of the Pacific Ocean, extending eastward approximately to a line between the head of the Ross Ice Shelf and Eights Coast. It stretches between 158°W and 103°24'W. The inclusion of the area between the Rockefeller Plateau and Eights Coast is based upon the leading role of Rear Admiral Richard E.

He led the Antarctic expedition of 191012 which was the first to reach the South Pole, on 14 December 1911. In 1926, he was the first expedition leader for the air expedition to the North Pole.\\n\\n- The Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was an era beginning at the end of the 19th century and closing with Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, the survivors stepping ashore in Wellington, New Zealand February 9, 1917. Historian Aant Elzinga gives the much later date of 1945, considering World War II to be the turning point in Antarctic research. During this period the Antarctic continent became the focus of an international effort that resulted in intensive scientific and geographical exploration and in which 17 major Antarctic expeditions were launched from ten countries. The common factor in these expeditions was the limited nature of the resources available to them before advances in transport and communication technologies revolutionized the work of exploration. This meant that each expedition became a feat of endurance that tested, and sometimes exceeded its personnel's physical and mental limits. The \\"heroic\\" label, bestowed later, recognized the adversities which had to be overcome by these pioneers, some of whom did not survive the experience; during this period 19 expedition members died.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'joseph stenhouse' exhibits the relationship of 'occupation'.

The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations.

The vast majority of the Catholics in Bulgaria in 2001 were ethnic Bulgarians and the rest belonged to a number of other ethnic groups such as Croatians, Italians, Arabs and Germans. Bulgarian Catholics live predominantly in the regions of Svishtov and Plovdiv and are mostly descendants of the heretical Christian sect of the Paulicians, which converted to Roman Catholicism in the 16th and 17th centuries. The largest Roman Catholic Bulgarian town is Rakovski in Plovdiv Province. Ethnic Bulgarian Roman Catholics known as the Banat Bulgarians also inhabit the Central European region of the Banat. Their number is unofficially estimated at about 12,000, although Romanian censuses count only 6,500 Banat Bulgarians in the Romanian part of the region. Bulgarian Catholics are descendants of three groups. The first were converted Paulicians from the course of the Osam river  and around Plovdiv are the second  group, while the third  one is formed by more recent Eastern Orthodox converts.\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: Were there more Roman Catholics in Bulgaria in 1992 or 2001?","target":"1992","rationale":"In order to answer whether there were more Roman Catholics in Bulgaria in 1992 or 2001, we first need to check how many they were respectively.

After tests confirmed that the healthy volunteers were solid sleepers, they took part in a three-night study in the university's sleep laboratory. The participants spent the night in a big and comfortable room. But the room also included four speakers positioned near the top of the bed.\\nDuring the night, the deep sleepers were subjected to 14 different recorded sounds, like street traffic, toilets flushing, an ice machine dispensing and an airplane flying overhead. Next door, the researchers monitored their sleep patterns and brain waves.\\nAs expected, all of the participants slept  ly well, but there were differences in how they responded to the noisy interruptions. Some of the sleepers didn't wake up even when a sound was blasted at 70 decibels  ; others were awakened by sounds at 40 or 50 decibels.\\nThe researchers discovered that the difference in a sleeper's reaction to noise could be predicted by the level of brain activity called \\"sleep spindles''. A sleep spindle is a burst of high-frequency brain activity coming from deep inside the brain during sleep. The source of the spindles is the thalamus, a part of the brain that sends sensory information to the rest of the cortex  .\\nBefore the study, the Massachusetts researchers theorized   that the spindles are the brain's way of preventing sensory information from passing through the thalamus and waking the rest of the brain during sleep. They found that the sleepers who experienced the most sleep spindles during the night were also the soundest sleepers and were least likely to be awakened by noise.\\nScientists already know that most people become lighter sleepers with age, most likely because older people experience less \\"slow wave sleep'', which is the deepest stage of sleep.

Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\nBased on the previous passage, Of the 2,900 prisoners, who will be released? \\nIs \\"Sick prisoners\\" a correct answer?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The passage says that since the pardon follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, it is a humanitarian gesture. The prisoners will be released based on certain criteria - those over 60 years of age; sick ones; females or young with no previous criminal record.

I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness.\\nBut when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker.\\nField recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.\\nQuestion: What desert did the author say was a fixture at Easter tables around Italy?\\nOptions:\\n- sugar cookies\\n- not enough information\\n- cotton candy\\n- colomba","target":"colomba","rationale":"The context states that colomba is one of those traditions that are now a given.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles.\\nIt is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.\\nTeasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates.

Human eosinophils (25-95% purity) were obtained from donors with a variety of diseases associated with hypereosinophilia. PAF-acether elicited directional locomotion of eosinophils, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, at concentrations from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M; lyso-PAF had minimal activity over the same dose range. Compared with PAF-acether, the eosinophil locomotory responsiveness of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), histamine, and the valyl- and alanyl-eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) tetrapeptides was negligible. Conversely, neutrophil responsiveness to PAF-acether (optimum 10(-6) M) was comparable in effect to LTB4 (optimum dose 10(-8) M). It was shown that PAF-acether elicited both chemotaxis and chemokinesis of eosinophils. Comparison of normal density and light density eosinophils revealed no qualitative difference in the response to PAF-acether and the other chemoattractants, although the light density cells seemed to demonstrate a greater degree of locomotion to PAF-acether and LTB4. Thus, PAF-acether appears to be a potent eosinophilotactic agent which may play a role in inflammatory reactions characterized by eosinophil infiltration. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes several numerical values, such as the concentration of PAF-acether used in the study (10(-5) to 10(-8) M), and a comparison between eosinophil responsiveness to different chemoattractants.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.\\n\\n The current trade-off between depth and computational cost makes it difficult to adopt deep neural networks for many industrial applications, especially when computing power is limited. Here, we are inspired by the idea that, while deeper embeddings are needed to discriminate difficult samples, a large number of samples can be well discriminated via much shallower embeddings. In this study, we introduce the concept of decision gates (d-gate), modules trained to decide whether a sample needs to be projected into a deeper embedding or if an early prediction can be made at the d-gate, thus enabling the computation of dynamic representations at different depths.   The proposed d-gate modules can be integrated with any deep neural network and reduces the average computational cost of the deep neural networks while maintaining modeling accuracy. Experimental results show that leveraging the proposed d-gate modules led to a ~38% speed-up and ~39% FLOPS reduction on ResNet-101 and ~46% speed-up and $\\\\sim$36\\\\% FLOPS reduction on DenseNet-201 trained on the CIFAR10 dataset with only ~2% drop in accuracy.","target":"This paper introduces a new dynamic feature representation approach to provide a more efficient way to do inference on deep neural networks","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nThis paper introduces a new dynamic feature representation approach to provide a more efficient way to do inference on deep neural networks."},{"source":"I first went to Harrow in the summer term.

One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an articulation that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only exceptions to this motif can be found in the area around Kalyani, where the temples exhibit a nagara (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character.In contrast to the buildings of the early Badami Chalukyas, whose monuments were clustered around the metropoleis of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation. The Western Chalukya temples were smaller than those of the early Chalukyas, a fact discernible in the reduced height of the superstructures which tower over the shrines.\\nThe Western Chalukya art evolved in two phases, the first lasting approximately a quarter of a century and the second from the beginning of 11th century until the end of Western Chalukya rule in 1186 CE. During the first phase, temples were built in the Aihole-Banashankari-Mahakuta region (situated in the early Chalukya heartland) and Ron in the Gadag district. A few provisional workshops built them in Sirval in the Gulbarga district and Gokak in the Belgaum district. The structures at Ron bear similarities to the Rashtrakuta temples in Kuknur in the Koppal district and Mudhol in the Bijapur district, evidence that the same workshops continued their activity under the new Karnata dynasty. The mature and latter phase reached its peak at Lakkundi (Lokigundi), a principal seat of the imperial court. From the mid-11th century, the artisans from the Lakkundi school moved south of the Tungabhadra River. Thus the influence of the Lakkundi school can be seen in some of the temples of the Davangere district, and in the temples at Hirehadagalli and Huvinahadgalli in the Bellary district.Influences of Western Chalukya...","target":"Kakatiya","rationale":"The Western Chalukya dynasty was a powerful Hindu empire in the Deccan from 1000-1200 CE.

My wife worked for the first seven years of our marriage, and when our oldest was four, she quit her job to be a SAHP.

This implied to me after our kids were older (and not in need of daycare), that she would be returning to work.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI do most of the home upkeep myself and also fold laundry, wash dishes, some of the cooking.

I expressed my concerns about money, wanting to be able to continue saving for retirement, to have money for going on a vacation, to have money to have the house remodeled.  We have a nice house, two older cars, are able to go out to dinner when we want, but do not go on expensive vacations or otherwise indulge ourselves.  It would be very helpful to have the additional income\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThree years later, my wife has not found a job.  She finally has told me that she does not want to work, and that since I make so much money, that she does not need to work.

She said that she was making too little money with daycare costs, which suggested to him that when the children were older she would return to work. However, twenty years later and three children later, his wife has not found a job and does not seem interested in working. Instead she feels that since he makes so much money they do not need her income as well.

The husband also expresses concern about saving enough money for retirement while paying college tuition without going into debt; these are all reasonable concerns given their financial situation. While it may be an inconvenience or cause some stress if he wants his wife to find a job now after staying home with three kids for twenty years, this does not make him an asshole because he simply wants them both on board financially when paying off expenses related to college tuition or maintaining a house remodel project he hopes they might eventually undertake in addition to saving enough for retirement funds down the line; this is only fair given how much he has already contributed financially over such long period of time during what began as an egalitarian relationship between spouses who share similar values around hard work ethic and savings goals but diverged from there over time due mainly perhaps by life circumstances beyond anyone's direct control rather than any desire on either partner's part towards acting selfishly or unfairly towards one another.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you are given inputs i and A, where i is an integer and A is a list.

In the hypokalemia group, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (5 g/kg body weight) was infused into the colon. In both groups, the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium were measured every 15 minutes for 60 minutes. The mean (+/- standard deviation) serum potassium level of the hypokalemia group decreased significantly from 3.81 +/- 0.21 to 2.92 +/- 0.36 mEq/liter; there were no significant changes in other electrolytes. After 60 minutes, epinephrine (10 micrograms/kg) was injected intravenously in the hypokalemia and control groups, and the arrhythmia ratio (the number of ventricular ectopic beats divided by the total heart rate) was calculated for 5 minutes. Each group was further classified into subgroups of dogs with an arrhythmia ratio higher or lower than 10%. An arrhythmia ratio over 10% was observed in 7.7% of the control group and 53% of the hypokalemia group. Immediately after 5 minutes of epinephrine injection, myocardial mitochondria and plasma membrane fraction were prepared from each group. Mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity of plasma membrane fraction were determined. Significant increases in both mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity were observed in the dogs with hypokalemia and an arrhythmia ratio greater than 10%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adenocarcinoma 2)Aged 3)Case Report","target":"No","rationale":"This abstract describes a study that investigated the mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias induced by epinephrine in dogs with hypokalemia.

It lasted until 1738 when the founder of the Afsharid dynasty, Nader Shah Afshar, defeated Hussain Hotak during the long siege of Kandahar, and started the reestablishment of Iranian suzerainty over all regions lost decades before against the Iranian archrival, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire. At its peak, the Hotak dynasty ruled briefly over an area which is now Afghanistan, Iran, western Pakistan, and some parts of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of a natural cause and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded the monarchy. He was quickly followed by Mahmud who ruled the empire at its largest extent for a mere three years. Following the 1729 Battle of Damghan, where Ashraf Hotak was roundly defeated by Nader Shah, Ashraf was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan with Hotak rule being confined to it.
