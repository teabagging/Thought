Glial and neuronal nuclear populations were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain except the cerebellum, followed by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in 2.4 and 2.2 M sucrose. For purposes of comparison, liver nuclei were prepared by centrifugation in 2.4 M sucrose. Microscopic examination of the nuclei confirmed the purity of the two nuclear fractions to be above 90% with minimal extranuclear contamination. T3 binding studies were performed on the washed nuclear fractions using saturation analysis techniques. Maximum binding (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. After 30 min incubation at 37 C, Bmax in neuronal nuclei was 1203 +/- 118 fmol/mg DNA (mean +/- SE) (n = 6), in comparison with 196 +/- 14 fmol/mg DNA in glial nuclei (n = 7). The corrected value for Bmax in glial nuclei, assuming 8% neuronal nuclear contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was 299 +/- 38 fmol/mg DNA (n = 6). The Kd values were 0.38 +/- 0.04 nM, 0.34 +/- 0.05 nM, and 0.33 +/- 0.04 nM in neuronal, glial, and liver nuclei, respectively. The specificity of T3 binding to the nuclear receptor in both neuronal and glial nuclei was studied in competition studies, and revealed closely similar relative binding affinities (T3 greater than T4 greater than rT3) in both. We conclude that the higher T3 binding capacity of neuronal nuclei may be related to their higher protein synthetic ability, suggesting that T3 may be of importance in a rapid structural turnover in these cells. The effect of T3 on myelination in glial cells may be mediated through the nucleus. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract contains numerical data including maximum binding values and dissociation constants in various types of nuclie, including neuronal nuclei, glial nuclei and liver nuclei.

In it the majority of students will have conformed to   the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women--the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrolment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country.\\nIt might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly, this apparent diversity   is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future.\\nDiversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmes recruit   their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior   academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach--arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters.\\nProfessor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the...\\nQuestion: What aspect of diversity does Valerie Gauthier think is most important?\\nOptions: A: Age and educational background.\\nB: Attitude and approach to business.\\nC: Social and professional experience.\\nD: Ethnic origin and gender.","target":"C","rationale":"The article mentions that the diversity of MBA classes is not as helpful as we might think.

Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.

As water becomes less and polluted more, conservation   becomes more and more important. The less water you use, the less wastewater will end up in our rivers and lakes. Wasting water means that more water needs to be treated and cleaned, a process that requires quite a lot of energy.\\nAs it is said above, cutting down on water usage is one of the most important things you can do for your local environment and the planet as a whole. That is why more green households are going blue: cutting down their water footprint by conserving and harvesting   water.\\nIt may seem like a big concept, but going blue starts with small changes that everyone can make. Something as simple as turning off the tap while you brush your teeth can save a lot of water. Wash your fruits and vegetables in a bowl rather than under a tap to save even more. Make sure that the taps are fully turned off every time you step away from the sink or the shower -- all those little drips can add up to a lot of water waste.\\nAnother way of reducing your water footprint is reducing your dependence on the main water supply.

Collecting water from your gutters   is a great way to keep your garden green without running the sprinkler  .\\nQuestion: From the passage, we can know that  _  .\\nOptions: A: we can get enough water by harvesting\\nB: most people pay no attention to saving water\\nC: we can practice rainwater harvesting in a small way\\nD: harvesting water is more necessary than conserving it","target":"C","rationale":"The passage mentions rainwater harvesting as a method of reducing one's water footprint.

On 1 December 1656, he signed an alliance with Ferdinand III of Habsburg in Vienna, essentially a declaration of Ferdinand III's intend to mediate a peace rather than provide military aid, which did not come into effect until Ferdinand's death on 2 April 1657. The treaty was however renewed and amended on 27 May by Ferdinand's successor Leopold I of Habsburg, who agreed in Vienna to provide John II Casimir with 12,000 troops maintained at Polish expense; in return, Leopold received Krak√≥w and Posen in pawn. Receiving the news, Frederick III of Denmark promptly declared war on Sweden, and by June the Austrian army entered the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the south, immediately stabilizing the situation in southern Poland, while Denmark attacked Swedish Bremen-Verden and turned to J√§mtland and V√§sterg√∂tland in July.

They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly.

Passage:The game's history can be traced back to 2005, when Goichi Suda and Shinji Mikami (creator of the Resident Evil series) became good friends while working together on Killer7. Suda wanted to make a survival horror game exclusively for the PlayStation 3. With his first horror title  receiving decent sales in Japan by 2006, Suda immediately began working on Kurayami (Japanese for 'Darkness') in his spare time. It was at one time thought to be called \\"Closer\\". However, EA later confirmed that name had been abandoned for another title. By the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2006, a publisher for Kurayami had not yet been established. In 2008, Suda presented the game's concept to EA Games, who agreed to license the Unreal Engine 3 and to publish the game to a worldwide audience. Shinji Mikami was then invited to executive-produce the project. Suda wanted to announce the game at E3 2009, but was not allowed to do so, due to a media silence agreement between Grasshopper Manufacture and EA Games. That December, Akira Yamaoka (sound designer for the Silent Hill series) left Konami after finishing his work on  and joined Grasshopper Manufacture because he enjoyed the latter's game No More Heroes. Yamaoka began work as the sound designer for the game. The game went about five different versions until Electronics Arts approved it. The newly titled Shadows of the Damned was finally unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in 2010 as an action game.","target":"a","rationale":"The question asks about how much time had passed between the PlayStation 3's Japanese release and Suda's first horror title that sold well on PlayStation 3. The passage provides information about when the game was developed, but does not directly provide information about how much time had passed between the two events. Additionally, it provides a clue in that it states \\"By the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2006, a publisher for Kurayami had not yet been established.\\" This states that Suda wanted to make a survival horror game exclusively for PlayStation 3 by 2006. Therefore, with this information and knowledge of when the E3 occurred and when Suda's first horror title sold well on PlayStation 3, you can infer how much time had passed between these events."},{"source":"The parking lot for the Center for Addictions Treatment was in the back of the building, as was the front door.

When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on.

The Vikings would respond with RB Adrian Peterson getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, no scoring would come until the final play of the half, as CB Antonio Cromartie returned a missed field goal 109 yards for a touchdown, the longest play in NFL history. In the third quarter, things started to get grim for San Diego as Minnesota took the lead with Peterson getting a 64-yard TD run and QB Brooks Bollinger completing a 40-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice.

Having already reached the 3,000 hits plateau the previous season, Murray joined Willie Mays and Hank Aaron as the only players ever to have hit at least 500 home runs and amassed 3,000 or more hits in their careers. Rafael Palmeiro,  Alex Rodriguez, and Albert Pujols have since joined the club. He participated in the Orioles playoff run, as the team advanced to the 1996 American League Championship Series against the Yankees after having beat his old team in the ALDS. In nine total postseason games, he went 10-for-30 while hitting one home run.  After being granted free agency by the Orioles, Murray was signed as a free agent by the Los Angeles Angels on December 18, 1996.

It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers.\\n\\nand the situation: A group of middle school students is measuring the temperature of various liquids for a chemistry lab using a mercury thermometer.

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\\n\\nPassage: While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes 'the principle of equality of its citizens' and is meant to be founded on 'representative democracy'. In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and 'qualified majorities' or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this 'democratic deficit' under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are 'degressively proportional' according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti √©cologiste 'Les Verts' v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power ('kratia') is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people ('demos'): in the EU it is not yet true that 'the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.'

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom.

Sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sera from normal subjects were tested for the presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA. Microtitration plates were coated with six McAb, five of them directed against different epitopes on hTg molecule, and then incubated with patients' sera. The bound antibody was detected with either peroxidase or 125I-labeled anti-human IgG. The specific positive reaction was observed in four of 40 patients with HT, in two of 26 patients with GD, in seven of 58 patients with RA, and in none of 20 normal subjects. The detected binding was due to the presence of anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies and not to Tg-anti-Tg circulating immune complexes, as the positive sera did not contain hTg when resolved on SDS-PAGE, nor did they bind to all anti-hTg McAb tested. The binding was dose dependent, and titers of anti-Id antibodies varied from 1:243 to 1:2187. The binding could be inhibited up to 50% by hTg, but not by the thyroid microsomal antigen, indicating that some of those anti-Id might represent the internal image of the antigen. Serum from the patient 3403, showing the strongest reactivity against McAb A-3, was chosen for IgG purification and F(ab')2 fragment isolation. The 3403 F(ab')2 fragment, but not the Fc fragment, was found to react specifically with four mouse anti-hTg McAb but not with the control mouse IgG. Thus, the obtained results permit the conclusion that anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies could occur naturally during the course of thyroid autoimmune disorders. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract presents numerical data and statistical analysis results from a study that tested the presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA.

Eight hypertensive patients and seven normotensive volunteer subjects were studied. Inulin and para-aminohippuric (PAH) clearances, natriuresis, and fractional excretion of sodium increased significantly after intravenous dosing with dopamine (2 micrograms/min/kg) in both groups. These increases were significantly higher in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects: 31.8% +/- 3.7% vs. 16.2% +/- 1.2% for inulin clearance (P less than 0.01), 83.3% +/- 10.5% vs. 41.1% +/- 3.4% for PAH clearance (P less than 0.01), and 331% +/- 38% vs. 216% +/- 26% for natriuresis (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest hyperresponsiveness to dopamine during hypertension. This enhanced response to exogenous dopamine can be considered as a further argument favoring the existence of a deficit in dopaminergic activity during hypertension. Dopamine also induced a significant reduction in blood pressure and increased heart rate in hypertensive subjects but no significant change in blood pressure and heart rate occurred in normotensive subjects. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Enhanced dopamine renal responsiveness in patients with hypertension. option2: Urine protein excretion in acute pancreatitis.","target":"Enhanced dopamine renal responsiveness in patients with hypertension","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that examined renal effects of low doses of exogenous dopamine and compared the renal dopaminergic response between hypertensive patients and normotensive subjects.

My older sister, Jane, told me to figure my life out and hung up on me. My oldest sister, Ann, drove down to pick me up and she gave me a place to stay. I think she saved my life that day. I ended up staying with her rent free for 2 years. During that time she also helped me in my personal life, kept me away from my abusive ex and addicted friends, found me a full time job and straightened out my life. I owe her so much. I'm thankful for all she did for me and that she didn't give up on me that day.

I was very involved in her wedding. Now Jane is getting married and she expected me to be as involved in her wedding as I was with Ann, but I'm not. I'm tired from working and I just don't want to bake a cake and other desserts for 70+ guests again. I told her she could reuse the centerpieces for her wedding but she wants completely new ones even though I kept them in really good condition. When Jane found out that I'm not keen on baking or crafting new center pieces for her wedding she complained that I was being unfair and showing favoritism. She tried begging but I continued to decline and said the reason I helped Ann with her wedding so much was to repay her kindness during the time I was homeless.

It is organisms, whether single- or multi-cellular, that produce new organisms. As we will discuss in detail when we consider the origins of multicellular organisms, a cell within a multicellular organism normally cannot survive outside the organism nor can it produce a new organism - it depends upon cooperation with the other cells of the organism. In fact, each multicellular organism is an example of a cooperative, highly integrated social system. The cells of a typical multicellular organism are part of a social system in which most cells have given up their ability to reproduce a new organism; their future depends upon the reproductive success of the organism of which they are a part. It is the organism‚Äôs success in generating new organisms that underlies evolution‚Äôs selective mechanisms. Within the organism, the cells that give rise to the next generation of organism are known as germ cells, those that do not (that is, the cells that die when the organism dies) are known as somatic cells.47 All organisms in the modern world, and for apparently the last ~3.5-3.8 billion years, arise from a pre-existing organism or, in the case of sexually reproducing organisms, from the cooperation of two organisms, an example of social evolution that we will consider in greater detail in Chapter 4. We will also see that breakdowns in such social systems can lead to the death of the organism or the disruption of the social system. Cancer is the most obvious example of an anti-social behavior; in evolutionary terms, it can, initially, be rewarded (more copies of the cancerous cell are produced) but ultimately leads to the extinction of the cancer, and often the death of the organism within which the cancer occurs.48 This is because evolutionary mechanisms are not driven by long term outcomes, but only by immediate ones.

Various types of wine were prescribed by Greek doctors for use as an analgesic, diuretic, tonic and digestive aid. The Greeks were also aware of some negative health effects, especially those arising from the consumption of wine beyond moderation. Athenaeus made frequent mention of wine's ability to induce hangover and suggested various remedies for it. The poet Eubulus noted that three bowls (kylikes) were the ideal amount of wine to consume. The quantity of three bowls to represent moderation is a recurring theme throughout Greek writing (today, the standard 750 ml bottle contains roughly three to six glasses of wine, depending on serving size).

Recycling programs not only increase energy use and pollution, but also cost more money than the disposal   of plain old garbage. Recycling may be the most wasteful activity in modern America.\\"\\nEnvironmental groups were quick to express their disagreement. They wrote reports on how recycling programs in cities can reduce pollution and cost less than regular garbage pickup and disposal. Michael Shapiro, an official of the US Environmental Protection Agency(EPA), said that \\"recycling can be good value for money, although there's still room for improvements.\\"\\nBut in 2002, New York City, a pioneer of recycling, found that its recycling program was losing money, so it stopped glass and plastic recycling. Other major cities watched closely to see how New York was dealing with its remaining program (the city never stopped paper recycling). But then it closed its last landfill  , and private companies out of New York raised prices due to the increased workload of carrying away and disposing New York's garbage. As a result, glass and plastic recycling became profitable for the city again, and New York brought the program back. According to Cecil Adams of The Chicago Reader, the lessons learned by New York are relevant everywhere.

REVIEW METHODS Studies of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (avelumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab) that had available hazard ratios for death based on PD-L1 positivity or negativity were included. The threshold for PD-L1 positivity or negativity was that PD-L1 stained cell accounted for 1% of tumour cells, or tumour and immune cells, assayed by immunohistochemistry staining methods.   \\n RESULTS 4174 patients with advanced or metastatic cancers from eight randomised controlled trials were included in this study. Compared with conventional agents, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors were associated with significantly prolonged overall survival in both patients that were PD-L1 positive (n=2254, hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.74) and PD-L1 negative (1920, 0.80, 0.71 to 0.90). However, the efficacies of PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade treatment in patients that were PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative were significantly different (P=0.02 for interaction). Additionally, in both patients that were PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative, the long term clinical benefits from PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade were observed consistently across interventional agent, cancer histotype, method of randomisation stratification, type of immunohistochemical scoring system, drug target, type of control group, and median follow-up time.   \\n CONCLUSIONS PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade therapy is a preferable treatment option over conventional therapy for both patients that are PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative. This finding suggests that PD-L1 expression status alone is insufficient in determining which patients should be offered PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade therapy.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract uses a structured format that includes a topic sentence (\\"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relative efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors versus conventional drugs in patients with cancer that were PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative. \\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence (\\"CONCLUSIONS PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade therapy is a preferable treatment option over conventional therapy for both patients that are PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative.

Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents the high level of interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period.

The effect of cooling on the maximal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in patients with paramyotonia congenita was compared to that in patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Diminution in CMAP amplitude and area, which was observed in paramyotonia congenita, did not occur in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. We suggest that this effect of cooling on the CMAP can be utilized in the differentiation of these two syndromes.","target":"Action Potentials","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that compared the effect of cooling on maximal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in patients with paramyotonia congenita to those with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.

The police arrive at the apartment in time only to discover a woman (Jasmina Ilic) sprawled on the floor with her throat sliced open and the corpse of her daughter (Teodora Uveric) stuffed in the chimney. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) is called to assist in the investigation and discovers that the crime resembles a fictional murder in the short story The Murders in the Rue Morgue, which is part of a collection of stories penned by the writer Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusak).Poe has become a social pariah and penniless drunkard whose stories have not been circulated for some time. He has fallen in love with the beautiful young Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) and desires to marry her but faces opposition from her father Captain Charles Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson), a military man who loathes Poe and goes to the length of threatening physical violence. Poe is brought to see Fields for questioning and is horrified to learn someone is using his stories as the backdrop for a series of murders. Fields then proposes that Poe volunteer his services to help the police catch the killer and Poe agrees to the task.The two men are called to investigate the murder of literary critic Rufus Griswold (John Warnaby), the man who became Poe's rival after a feud that was published in the Baltimore newspapers. Poe realizes the gruesome crime resembles a scene from The Pit and the Pendulum as Fields notices a red demon mask near the corpse. The two then deduce that the scene of the next crime will take place at Captain Hamilton's annual masquerade ball a scene that will resemble the Masked Ball in The Masque of the Red Death.Fields assigns several members of the Baltimore Police to go undercover as guests at the Masked Ball. Sometime before midnight, at the height of the festivities, a man on horseback dressed in a skeleton costume appears. Fields shoots the man only to learn he was an actor hired for the entertainment and receives an anonymous note. Poe then realizes Emily has been kidnapped, meaning the event was all a distraction. It's revealed in the killer's note that he will continue to commit murders and leave clues to Emily's location. The killer then threatens to kill Emily if Poe does not start writing columns for the newspaper that describe the brutal combination of fact and fiction forcing Poe to comply with the request in order to save Emily.The local Medical School's anatomy class discovers a live raven and the corpse of a prostitute in theatrical clothing. Poe and Fields investigate and deduce the scene resembles The Mystery of Marie Roget except for one detail the blood on the corpse's hands was not an element of Poe's story. The two soon learn the woman was an actress (Ana Sofrenovic) in costume as Lady Macbeth and rush to the theatre where the victim worked, demanding to see all the stage hands. All the stage hands are accounted for except for Maurice Rabichaux (Dejan Cubrilov), a sailor on leave after his ship landed in Baltimore. Poe and Fields notice a mysterious figure running along the catwalks and pursue him but the figure escapes. Fields later makes an off-handed comment that the name of the ship Maurice arrived on is the Fortunato which prompts Poe to realize the next murder will resemble The Cask of Amontillado.Poe and Fields search tunnels under the city with several policemen and discover an area with fresh brickwork, an area that might be where Emily is being held. The officers smash through the brick and discover what appears to be a woman with blonde hair in the costume Emily wore the night she was kidnapped. But the body is revealed to be that of the sailor Maurice, who was dressed to resemble Emily after he was killed and buried in the niche. Two clues are found on Maurice: a pocket watch that was stopped at 12:27 and then stuffed into his mouth, and a tattoo on his back that had some flesh carved out of it.

Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow‚Äîand thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells.

Of these, four genes are known to produce truncated transcripts that end within the coding sequence of longer transcripts: CBP1 , AEP2 / ATP13 , RNA14 and SIR1 . It has been shown that the level of the truncated CBP1 transcript increases during the switch to respiratory growth while that of the full-length transcript decreases. To determine whether this phenomenon is unique to CBP1 , northern analysis was used to determine whether the levels of other truncated transcripts are regulated similarly by carbon source. The levels of the shortest transcripts of AEP2 / ATP13 and RNA14 increased during respiration while the shortest SIR1 transcript remained constant. However, two longer SIR1 transcripts were regulated reciprocally by carbon source. Mapping the 3'-ends of each transcript by sequencing partial cDNA clones revealed multiple 3'-ends for each transcript. Examination of the sequences surrounding the 3'-ends of the induced transcripts failed to identify a consensus sequence but did reveal weak putative 3'-end formation signals in all of the transcripts. Similarly, no consensus sequence was found when the sequences surrounding the 3'-ends of the longest transcripts were compared, but again weak putative 3'-end formation signals were identified. These data are suggestive of carbon source regulation of alternative poly(A) site choice in yeast..

The population coalesced first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. A 1973 military coup saw a change of leadership, but pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died together when their plane was shot down in April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\\nRwanda's economy suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened.

She is a soprano and has a vocal range of three octaves. Turunen studied singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule fur Musik Karlsruhe. She is a professional classical lied singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which she founded with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996.\\n\\nTurunen's voice is described by critics as remarkably powerful and emotional. Sometimes it is stated that her voice is too trained or operatic for metal music, but even critics who do not like classical voices admit that her voice suits the kind of metal songs she sings unusually well.  Until the end of their collaboration, Turunen's singing was a trademark of Nightwish. She was known as the face and voice of Nightwish while bandleader Holopainen was the soul. Turunen was seen as a key to Nightwish's success. She is respected by other musicians of the metal genre and is an influence on their work; for instance, Simone Simons of Epica names her as her inspiration to study classical music and apply that vocal style to a metal band.  Turunen receives most of her media attention in Europe, especially in her home of Finland. In December 2003, she was invited by Finnish president Tarja Halonen to celebrate the Finnish Independence Day at the Presidential Palace together with other Finnish celebrities. The event is televised annually live by the state-owned broadcaster, the Finnish Broadcasting Company. In December 2007, she performed different versions of the Finnish national anthem \\"Maamme\\" (Finnish: \\"Our country\\") accompanied by the Tapiola Sinfonietta, to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Finnish independence. The concert was televised by the Finnish Broadcasting Company for 2 million Finnish viewers. In December 2013, Turunen was the invited soloist at the Christmas Peace event in the Turku Cathedral, Finland, with the presence of Finnish president Sauli Niinisto. The concert aired on Yle TV1 at the Christmas Eve. During her solo career, Turunen has sold over 100,000 certified records in Finland, which places her among the top 50 of best-selling female soloists.  In Europe, her popularity is mainly limited to the hard rock and metal scene. She had a broader exposure on November 30, 2007, when she was invited to open the farewell fight of Regina Halmich. Her performance of \\"I Walk Alone\\" was televised live by the German television station ZDF for 8.8 million viewers. Turunen will be one of the star coaches in the fourth season of The Voice of Finland in the spring of 2015 on Nelonen.

Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow‚Äîand thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which brother didn't have excess calcium salts deposited in the blood vessels?","target":"Dan","rationale":"The context indicates that Ben was diagnosed with hypercalcaemia, while Dan's blood levels were normal.

He grew up in polite society and became a well-known artist, sought after for his talent in producing portraits.

And while the number of activities we delay doing in any given week varies from person to person, it's fair to say that none of us is super-efficient 100 percent of the time.\\nA study revealed that we spend about 218 minutes procrastinating every day, which amounts to 55 days of lost time each year.

And procrastination isn't just a money thief ---- it steals time too. In general, people who continually put things off are unhappier, as well as being less wealthy and healthy.\\nSo why do we do it? \\"When we avoid taking action, we're really avoiding pain,\\" explains psychiatrist   Phil Stutz. For most of us, pain avoidance isn't limited to one situation. It applies to almost anything that's painful. Most of us try our best never to leave a comfort zone. That's why we sacrifice something much more valuable: time. \\"Our time on earth is limited,\\" Stutz adds. \\"Every moment is an opportunity we'll never have again.

PDK1 is a key molecule that couples PI3K to cell proliferation and survival signals in response to growth factor receptor activation, and is oncogenic when expressed in mouse mammary epithelial cells. We now present evidence showing that PDK1-expressing cells exhibit enhanced anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth and are highly invasive when grown on Matrigel. These properties correlate with induction of MMP-2 activity, increased MT1-MMP expression and a unique gene expression profile.', 'Invasion assays in Matrigel, MMP-2 zymogram analysis, gene microarray analysis and mammary isografts were used to characterize the invasive and proliferative function of cells expressing PDK1. Tissue microarray analysis of human breast cancers was used to measure PDK1 expression in invasive tumors by IHC.', 'Enhanced invasion on Matrigel in PDK1-expressing cells was accompanied by increased MMP-2 activity resulting from stabilization against proteasomal degradation. Increased MMP-2 activity was accompanied by elevated levels of MT1-MMP, which is involved in generating active MMP-2. Gene microarray analysis identified increased expression of the ECM-associated genes decorin and type I procollagen, whose gene products are substrates of MT1-MMP. Mammary fat pad isografts of PDK1-expressing cells produced invasive adenocarcinomas. Tissue microarray analysis of human invasive breast cancer indicated that PDK1pSer241 was strongly expressed in 90% of samples.\\\\Question: Does 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 ( PDK1 ) promote invasion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases?","target":"These results indicate that PDK1 serves as an important effector of mammary epithelial cell growth and invasion in the transformed phenotype.

It includes the moderate hits \`\` Ai n't Even Done with the Night , '' which reached # 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 as the album 's second single , and \`\` This Time , '' which peaked at # 27 as the album 's lead single . \`\` The singles were stupid little pop songs , '' Mellencamp told Record Magazine in 1983 . \`\` I take no credit for that record . It was n't like the title was made up -- it was n't supposed to be punky or cocky like some people thought . Toward the end , I did n't even go to the studio . Me and the guys in the band thought we were finished , anyway . It was the most expensive record I ever made . It cost $ 280,000 , do you believe that ? The worst thing was that I could have gone on making records like that for hundreds of years . Hell , as long as you sell a few records and the record company is n't putting a lot of money into promotion , you 're making money for ' em and that 's all they care about . PolyGram loved Nothin ' Matters . They thought I was going to turn into the next Neil Diamond . '' Mellencamp wrote \`\` To M.G. ( Wherever She May Be ) '' in remembrance of his high school girlfriend , whose name was Margie ( aka M.G. ) . The woman on the album 's cover , Edith Massey , was chosen because , as Mellencamp told Rolling Stone in late 1980 , \`\` I was looking for a typical heavy woman to convey a lower - middle - class way of living . '' The remastered version was released March 29 , 2005 , on Mercury / Island / UMe and includes one bonus track , \`\` Latest Game , '' which , according to the liner notes , was taken from the sessions for Mellencamp 's 1982 album American Fool .\\n\\n- \\"Small Town\\" is a 1985 song written by John Mellencamp and released on his 1985 album \\"Scarecrow\\".

My ex girlfriend was sexually abused by her own uncles at the age of 5 to 9, had a lot of illusions and psychological problems, along with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, dispite my requests, she never had ever visited a psychologist or psychiatrist in her then 24 years of lifetime, fearing she would be forced to unveil the uncles‚Äô child sexual abuse act and this would cause her dismissal from her immediate family.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...\\n\\nParagraph: Greg and Lucy are two elementary school students in the same class.

In the first quarter, Green Bay's first possession, RB Ryan Grant fumbled the football and it was recovered by Dallas. Green Bay's defense responded by keeping Dallas out of the end zone and they had to settle for a 25-yard Nick Folk field goal. Green Bay moved the ball quite effectively the next drive, starting it off with a 26-yard completion to Greg Jennings. The drive ended when Aaron Rodgers was sacked for an 11-yard loss on 3rd down. The Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 36-yard field goal. The Cowboys next drive was fueled by a couple of long runs by RB Marion Barber. Dallas moved all the way down to Green Bay's 14, but on 3rd down Cowboy's QB Tony Romo threw a pass intended for TE Jason Witten and it was intercepted in the end zone by FS Nick Collins and returned to the Cowboy's 43-yard line. In the second quarter, Green Bay started off the quarter with some quick and effective short throws. The Packers managed to move the ball to the Dallas 20 without running the ball once on the drive. An Aaron Rodgers incomplete pass to WR James Jones on 3rd down set up a 38-yard Mason Crosby field goal. The Cowboys managed to get one first down on the next drive, but were stopped on 3rd down the next drive after Aaron Kampman and Cullen Jenkins teamed up for the sack on Tony Romo. Dallas punted and Green Bay went three and out with a couple of minimal runs by Ryan Grant and an incomplete pass to Greg Jennings forcing the Packers to punt. The Cowboys closed out the half with a RB Felix Jones 60-yard touchdown and a 39-yard Nick Folk field goal. The Packers were down 13-6 at the half. In the third quarter, Dallas received the ball first but were forced to punt 6 plays later. Green Bay's first drive of the second half started off with some solid runs by RB Brandon Jackson, but the highlight of the drive was 50-yard pass to Donald Driver on 3rd and 5 that set the Packers up with a 1st and goal at the Dallas 8. Aaron Rodgers was then sacked on 2nd and 3rd down and the Packers yet again were held to another Mason Crosby field goal. This field goal marked the 3rd time the Packers were shut down in the red zone and had to settle for a field goal in the game. On the Cowboy's next drive, Tony Romo completed a 63-yard pass to Miles Austin which set the Cowboy's up for a 2-yard Marion Barber touchdown extending their lead to 11 points going into the 4th quarter. In the fourth quarter, Dallas extended their lead to 18 points with a 52-yard Miles Austin catch and touchdown. Later in the 4th, RB Marion Barber fumbled the ball and it was recovered by CB Will Blackmon at the Green Bay 12-yard line. With Dallas playing a prevent style defense, Rodgers completed 8 of 10 passes down to the Dallas 1-yard line. Rodgers sneaked the ball into the end zone for the touchdown bringing the Dallas lead back down to 11 points. After the touchdown the Packers attempted an onside kick which was recovered by Tramon Williams but he was flagged for illegal touching and possession was awarded to Dallas along with a 5-yard penalty from the spot of the foul. Dallas moved the ball into field goal range but Romo threw an incomplete pass to Terrell Owens on 3rd down and followed it up with another incomplete pass to Jason Witten on 4th down giving the Packers the ball back. The Packers moved the ball slightly, but the drive ended when Brandon Jackson caught a pass on 4th down and ran out of bounds before the 1st down marker.

Methods: The anticryptosporidial effect of ATA was evaluated in vitro using cell culture and double fluorogenic staining, and in vivo in experimentally infected neonatal C57BL/6 mice. Mice were orally treated for 9 consecutive days starting on the day of infection with daily ATA doses of 50 and 100 mmol/kg. Paromomycin (100 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Results: In both in vitro models, ATA at concentrations of 100 and 10 mmol/L completely inhibited sporozoites within 10 and 60 min, respectively. Viability of oocysts exposed to 100 mmol/L and assessed by flow cytometry and in cell culture was reduced by 65% and 61%, respectively. The treatment of neonatal mice with a daily ATA dose of 100 mmol/kg led to 97-99% inhibition of infection without any observable negative effects on the animals.

But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe.\\nPrevious studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure.\\nThe authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health.\\nThe text mainly discusses the relationship between  _  .\\nA) heart problems and air quality\\nB) heart problems and exercising\\nC) heart problems and smoking\\nD) heart problems and fatty food","target":"A","rationale":"The text discusses the relationship between air pollution and heart disease.

My sister has also previously had a fling with the guy.

Mongrel dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated to maintain an end-tidal PCO2 between 35 and 40 Torr. In one group, the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked to eliminate neural and humoral adrenergic influences. In a second group, alpha-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to decrease O2 delivery by excessive vasoconstriction. In a third group, beta-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to increase O2 delivery. Whole-body and hindlimb muscle O2 uptake and vascular responses were measured during normoxic control, 15 or 30 min of severe hypoxia (9% O2 in N2), and 20 or 30 min of normoxic recovery, respectively. The whole-body O2 deficit and excess O2 uptake in recovery were partitioned into muscle and nonmuscle areas. The data showed that neural or humoral influences had little effect on the regional distribution of the total O2 deficit and O2 excess in recovery. The O2 deficit could be decreased somewhat by increasing delivery, but the amount of excess O2 used in recovery was unaffected. This suggested that the excess O2 use in recovery was more a function of an energy deficit during hypoxia and not an O2 deficit. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Adrenergic and local control of O2 uptake during and after severe hypoxia. option2: The importance of plasma protein for blood volume and blood pressure homeostasis.","target":"Adrenergic and local control of O2 uptake during and after severe hypoxia","rationale":"The abstract describes a study of the distribution of O2 supply during severe hypoxia and recovery, as well as its relation to the regional distribution of O2 deficit and repayment.

True to the film 's title , at one point in the course of the narrative he battles a \`\` bear '' , actually a human actor in a bear costume .\\n\\n- , also known as Sonny Chiba, is a Japanese actor, singer, film producer, film director, and martial artist.\\n\\n- A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\\n\\n- Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.\\n\\n- A cameo role or cameo appearance (often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts, typically unnamed or appearing as themselves. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake), or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common. A crew member of the show or movie playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as Alfred Hitchcock's frequently performed cameos.\\n\\n- An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- History.\\nFounding of International Karate Organization / Kyokushinkaikan.\\nAfter formally establishing the Kyokushinkaikan in 1964, Oyama directed the organization through a period of expansion. Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Jon Bluming, Steve Arneil, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. In 1969, Oyama staged \\"The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year. In 1975, \\"The First World Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" were held in Tokyo.

Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century.

HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981.

The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip‚Äôs mode of operation from \\"lock\\" to \\"key\\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console‚Äôs ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating \\"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\".

Therefore, this is clearly mentioned to be 3193 within the article and can thus be considered an answerable question.\\""},{"source":"In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole.

It is also expected that little sunlight or rainfall would reduce the growth of a tree.

To find out the weather of ten years ago, you can count the rings of a tree trunk from the outside to the inside.

Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth‚Äôs temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.","target":"Brown","rationale":"The question asks which village has more of an impact on global climate change. The paragraph describes the carbon cycle, a process where plants take in CO2 and release oxygen during photosynthesis.

This is known as greenhouse gas emission because it traps heat from sunlight inside Earth‚Äôs atmosphere instead of letting it escape back out into space like normal gases do.\\n\\nBrown Village extracts fossil fuels for mining operations while Yellow Village does not exploit any type of fuel at all; therefore Brown Village causes more pollution by burning these extracted resources compared to what Yellow Village produces through their gold mining activities alone (which don't seem harmful enough)."},{"source":"The following document has been corrupted.

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back.

Adaptation in these pathways may ultimately affect electrophysiological and morphological properties of neurones. We have previously shown that repeated electroconvulsive stimulation, a safe and effective antidepressant treatment, has profound effects on hippocampal synaptic connectivity and plasticity in the rat. Here, we investigated whether these electrophysiological properties were shared by the chemical antidepressant, fluoxetine.', 'To compare the electrophysiological and cognitive effects of two very different antidepressant treatments: repeated electroconvulsive stimulation (rECS); and chronic administration of the serotonin specific re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine.', 'Rats were exposed to either rECS or daily fluoxetine administration for 15 days. The animals were then anaesthetised and dentate field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) characteristics were measured before and after the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by high frequency perforant path stimulation. In a separate experiment, the effects of rECS and chronic fluoxetine administration on acquisition and retention of a spatial learning task in the Morris watermaze were determined.', 'Chronic fluoxetine administration and rECS produced equivalent increases in dentate fEPSP compared to respective control groups. LTP induction was attenuated in both groups. Spatial learning was, in contrast, unaffected by fluoxetine treatment but significantly impaired following rECS.\\nAnswer: Given that fluoxetine and rECS share antidepressant properties, but differ in their effects on learning and memory, we propose that the common effects on dentate connectivity and synaptic plasticity described here are more likely to relate to affective rather than cognitive function. This result is consistent with other experiments showing that a reduction in dentate connectivity correlates with stress susceptibility in animals.","target":"Do repeated ECS and fluoxetine administration have equivalent effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity?","rationale":"The question is based on the information in the context that fluoxetine and ECS are two different antidepressant treatments but share effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

Symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing. Some people may have chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before this occurs. If not treated within minutes, death usually occurs.\\nThe most common cause of cardiac arrest is coronary artery disease. Less common causes include major blood loss, lack of oxygen, very low potassium, heart failure, and intense physical exercise. A number of inherited disorders may also increase the risk including long QT syndrome. The initial heart rhythm is most often ventricular fibrillation. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding no pulse. While a cardiac arrest may be caused by heart attack or heart failure these are not the same.\\nPrevention includes not smoking, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. Treatment for cardiac arrest is immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and, if a shockable rhythm is present, defibrillation. Among those who survive targeted temperature management may improve outcomes. An implantable cardiac defibrillator may be placed to reduce the chance of death from recurrence.\\nIn the United States, cardiac arrest outside of hospital occurs in about 13 per 10,000 people per year (326,000 cases). In hospital cardiac arrest occurs in an additional 209,000 Cardiac arrest becomes more common with age. It affects males more often than females. The percentage of people who survive with treatment is about 8%. Many who survive have significant disability. Many U.S. television shows, however, have portrayed unrealistically high survival rates of 67%.\\n\\n- Heart failure (HF), often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF), occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. Signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise, while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.\\nCommon causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the functioning of the heart. There are two main types of heart failure: \\"heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction\\" and \\"heart failure with normal ejection fraction\\" depending on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract is affected, or the heart's ability to relax. The severity of disease is usually graded by the degree of problems with exercise. Heart failure is not the same as myocardial infarction (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease.\\nThe condition is diagnosed based on the history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause. Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease. In people with chronic stable mild heart failure, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking, physical exercise, and dietary changes, as well as medications. In those with heart failure due to left ventricular...\\n\\n- Resuscitation is the process of correcting physiological disorders in an acutely unwell patient. It is an important part of intensive care medicine, trauma surgery and emergency medicine. Well known examples are cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\\n\\n- Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib or VF) is when the heart quivers instead of pumping due to disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles. It results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse. This is followed by irreversible death in the absence of treatment. Ventricular fibrillation is found initially in about 10% of people in cardiac arrest.\\nVentricular fibrillation can occur due to coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing irregular unformed QRS complexes without any clear P waves. An important differential diagnosis is torsades de pointes.\\nTreatment is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic. The medication epinephrine or amiodarone may be given if initial treatments are not effective. Rates of survival are about 46%. \\n\\n- Commotio cordis ( Latin , \`\` agitation of the heart '' ) is an often lethal disruption of heart rhythm that occurs as a result of a blow to the area directly over the heart ( the precordial region ) , at a critical time during the cycle of a heart beat causing cardiac arrest . It is a form of ventricular fibrillation ( V - Fib ) , not mechanical damage to the heart muscle or surrounding organs , and not the result of heart disease . The fatality rate is about 65 % . It can sometimes , but not always , be reversed by defibrillation . Commotio cordis occurs mostly in boys and young men ( average age 15 ) , usually during sports , most often baseball , often despite a chest protector . It is most often caused by a projectile , but can also be caused by the blow of an elbow or other body part . Being less developed , the thorax of an adolescent is likely more prone to this injury given the circumstances . The phenomenon was confirmed experimentally in the 1930s , with research in anaesthetized rabbits , cats and dogs .\\n\\n- A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.\\n\\n- Heart Rhythm is a peer-reviewed medical journal that covers the study and management of cardiac arrhythmia.

A possible change in the role of specialists and general practitioners in the care of these patients was explored by a questionnaire mailed to all Dutch neurologists and a random sample of general practitioners. Patients were also asked their opinion. The real situation was studied in a group of patients retrieved from the registers of general practitioners. Demographic, psychosocial, and epilepsy characteristics were sampled. Specialists tend not to want a change in their role; general practitioners desire a change. At present, patients do not want a change, but in future a change might be acceptable to them. More patients than expected were supervised by their general practitioner only. Their demographic and psychosocial characteristics did not differ from those in the population at large.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.\\n\\n- Avitoluvarus ( \`\` Ancient Louvar '' ) is a genus of extinct louvar that lived in the Tethys Ocean during the early Paleogene . The first specimens were found from the Danata Formation Lagerst√§tten , of the Thanetian epoch of Turkmenistan , where they were originally thought to be smaller or juvenile individuals of the true louvar , Luvarus necopinatus . These specimens were later reexamined , and determined to be a separate genus comprising two species . A third species , A. eocaenicus is known from the Middle Eocene of the Kumsky Horizon , in what is now the Northern Caucasus Mountains in Southwestern Russia . Avitoluvarus differs from modern louvars in that the former 's forehead does not bulge out as much , giving the appearance of having the face appear higher .\\n\\n- Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.\\n\\n- Tertiary is the former term for the geologic period from 66 million to 2.58 million years ago, a time span that lies between the superseded Secondary period and the Quaternary. The Tertiary is no longer recognized as a formal unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, but the word is still widely used. The traditional span of the Tertiary has been divided between the Paleogene and Neogene Periods and extends to the first stage of the Pleistocene Epoch, the Gelasian age. \\nThe period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event, at the start of the Cenozoic Era, and extended to the beginning of the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the Pliocene Epoch.\\n\\n- Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.\\n\\n- Turkmenistan (or  ); formerly known as Turkmenia is a country in Central Asia, bordered by Kazakhstan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north and east, Afghanistan to the southeast, Iran to the south and southwest, and the Caspian Sea to the west.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Kazakhstan ( \\"Qazaqstan\\",  \\"Kazakhstan\\"), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (\\"Qazaqstan Respwbl√Økas\\" \\"Respublika Kazakhstan\\"), is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. It also has vast mineral resources.\\n\\n- The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phan√¶rozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phaner√≥s) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.\\n\\n- The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Pal√¶ogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. \\n\\n- The Tethys Ocean (Ancient Greek: ) was an ocean that existed between the continents of Gondwana and Laurasia during much of the Mesozoic era, before the opening of the Indian and Atlantic oceans during the Cretaceous period. It is also referred to as the Tethys Sea or Neotethys.\\n\\n- Laurasia (or ) was the more northern of two supercontinents (the other being Gondwana) that formed part of the Pangaea supercontinent around (Mya). It separated from Gondwana (beginning in the late Triassic period) during the breakup of Pangaea, drifting farther north after the split.\\n\\n- In paleogeography, Gondwana,\\nalso Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510¬†million years ago¬†(Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it.\\n\\n- An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.\\n\\n- A genus (¬†genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.\\n\\n- The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast.\\n\\n- The louvar or luvar, \\"Luvaris imperialis\\", is a species of perciform fish, the only extant species in the genus \\"Luvaris\\" and family Luvaridae.

The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a \\"great white whale\\" as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick. Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories includes the story of \\"How the Whale got in his Throat\\". Niki Caro's film the Whale Rider has a MƒÅori girl ride a whale in her journey to be a suitable heir to the chieftain-ship.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow‚Äîand thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.\\n\\nParagraph: Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well.

Throughout the 1930s, the study was his base for the writing of many of his most successful books. His biography of his ancestor Marlborough and his The World Crisis were written there, and A History of the English-Speaking Peoples was begun and concluded there, although interrupted by the Second World War.

Often called a living fossil, the Amami rabbit is a living remnant of ancient rabbits that once lived on the Asian mainland, where they died out, remaining only on the two small islands where they survive today.\\n\\n- The European rabbit or common rabbit (\\"Oryctolagus cuniculus\\") is a species of rabbit native to southwestern Europe (Spain and Portugal) and northwest Africa (Morocco and Algeria). It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus, as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle. It is known as an invasive species because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, due to the lack of natural predators there.\\n\\n- Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.\\n\\n- Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit (\\"Oryctolagus cuniculus\\"), cottontail rabbits (genus \\"Sylvilagus\\"; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (\\"Pentalagus furnessi\\", an endangered species on Amami shima, Japan). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. The male is called a \\"buck\\" and the female is a \\"doe\\"; a young rabbit is a \\"kitten\\" or \\"kit\\". \\n\\n- Nesolagus is a genus of rabbits containing three species of striped rabbit , the Annamite Striped Rabbit , the Sumatran Striped Rabbit , and that of the extinct species \`\` sinensis '' . Overall there is very little known about the genus as a whole , most information coming from the Sumatran Rabbit .\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Leporidae is a family of mammals that include rabbits and hares, over 60 species in all. The Latin word \\"Leporidae\\" means \\"those that resemble \\"lepus\\"\\" (hare). Together with the pikas, the Leporidae constitute the mammalian order Lagomorpha. Leporidae differ from pikas in that they have short, furry tails and elongated ears and hind legs.\\n\\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- The island, 712.35 ¬†km in area, has a population of approximately 73,000 people. Administratively it is divided into the city of Amami, the towns of Tatsug, Setouchi, and the villages of Uken and Yamato in Kagoshima Prefecture. Much of the island is within the borders of the Amami Gunt Quasi-National Park.\\n\\n- A genus (¬†genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- The lagomorphs are the members of the taxonomic order Lagomorpha, of which there are two living families: the Leporidae (hares and rabbits) and the Ochotonidae (pikas). The name of the order is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"lagos\\" (, \\"hare\\") +\\"morph\\" (, \\"form\\"). There are about eighty-seven species of lagomorph, including about twenty-nine species of pika, twenty-eight species of rabbit and cottontail, and thirty species of hare.\\n\\n- A pika (; archaically spelled pica) is a small mammal, with short limbs, very round body, rounded ears, and no external tail. Pikas look like a combination of a rabbit, guinea pig or vole. They live in mountainous countries in Asia, with one species also in North America. Most pikas prefer rocky slopes. The large-eared pika of the Himalayas and nearby mountains is one of the highest living mammals, found at heights of more than 6000¬†m. Pikas graze on a range of plants, mostly grasses, flowers and young stems. In the autumn, they pull hay, soft twigs and other stores of food into their burrows to eat during the long, cold winter. The name \\"pika\\" is used for any member of the Ochotonidae, a family within the order of lagomorphs, which also includes the Leporidae (rabbits and hares). One genus, Ochotona, is recognised within the family, and it includes 30 species. It is also known as the \\"whistling hare\\" due to its high-pitched alarm call when diving into its burrow. In the United States, the pika is colloquially called a \\"coney\\", a nonspecific term also used for rabbits, hares, and hyraxes. The name \\"pika\\" appears to be derived from the Tungus \\"piika\\" and the scientific name \\"Ochotona\\" is from the Mongolian word \\"ogdoi\\" which means pika.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'nesolagus' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'.

That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthen ordered‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇto vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant.

The new Tribune Messala (Stephen Boyd) once lived in Judea as a boy, and longs to rekindle his old friendship with Judah, but when they meet it is obvious that Messala has been changed by the years he has been away, fighting the enemies of the Empire. He is harsh and calculating, driven by ambition, and eager to prove himself to Caesar. Asking Judah for help in rounding up the local dissenters, they argue, and when Judah refuses to betray his own people Messala declares that they must be either friends or enemies, and leaves in anger.A few days later the Romans parade through the city in a show of force, and as they pass the house of Hur, Judah's sister leans out over the balcony for a better look.

Instead of lunches at LutÔøΩÔøΩce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for.

Early on there are often no symptoms. Over time, however, some people experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes. While it does not result in complete blindness, loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life. Visual hallucinations may also occur but these do not represent a mental illness.\\nMacular degeneration typically occurs in older people. Genetic factors and smoking also play a role. It is due to damage to the macula of the retina. Diagnosis is by a complete eye exam. The severity is divided into early, intermediate, and late types. The late type is additionally divided into \\"dry\\" and \\"wet\\" forms with the dry form making up 90% of cases.\\nPrevention includes exercising, eating well, and not smoking. Antioxidant vitamins and minerals do not appear to be useful for prevention. There is no cure or treatment that returns vision already lost. In the wet form, anti-VEGF medication injected into the eye or less commonly laser coagulation or photodynamic therapy may slow worsening. Supplements in those who already have the disease may slow progression.\\nIn 2010 it affected 23.5 million people globally. In 2013 moderate to severe disease affected 13.4 million and it is the fourth most common cause of blindness after cataracts, preterm birth, and glaucoma. It most commonly occurs in people over the age of fifty and in the United States is the most common cause of vision loss in this age group. About 0.4% of people between 50 and 60 have the disease, while it occurs in 0.7% of people 60 to 70, 2.3% of those 70 to 80, and nearly 12% of people over 80 years old.\\nSigns and symptoms.\\nSigns and symptoms of macular degeneration include:\\nMacular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a very small number of...\\n\\n- S. Robert Morgan is an American television actor . He guest starred on Home Box Office drama series The Wire as Butchie from the second season until the show 's fifth and final season . Morgan lost his sight in his twenties due to macular degeneration . Morgan is from Fort Washington , Maryland and works as a theatre director as well as an actor . He is a regular user of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library .\\n\\n- Preterm birth, also known as premature birth, is the birth of a baby at fewer than 37 weeks gestational age. These babies are known as preemies or premmies. Symptoms of preterm labor include uterine contractions which occur more often than every ten minutes or the leaking of fluid from the vagina. Premature infants are at greater risk for cerebral palsy, delays in development, hearing problems, and sight problems. These risks are greater the earlier a baby is born.\\nThe cause of preterm birth is often not known. Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, being pregnant with more than one baby, being either obese or underweight, a number of vaginal infections, tobacco smoking, and psychological stress, among others. It is recommended that labor not be medically induced before 39 weeks unless required for other medical reasons. The same recommendation applies to cesarean section. Medical reasons for early delivery include preeclampsia.\\nIn those at risk, the hormone progesterone, if taken during pregnancy, may prevent preterm birth. Evidence does not support the usefulness of bed rest. It is estimated that at least 75% of preterm infants would survive with appropriate treatment. In women who might deliver between 24 and 37¬†weeks corticosteroids improve outcomes. A number of medications including nifedipine may delay delivery so that a mother can be moved to where more medical care is available and the corticosteroids have a greater chance to work. Once the baby is born care includes keeping the baby warm through skin to skin contact, supporting breastfeeding, treating infections, and supporting breathing.\\nPreterm birth is the most common cause of death among infants worldwide. About 15 million babies are preterm each year (5% to 18% of all deliveries). In many countries rates of premature births have increased between the 1990s and 2010s. Complications from preterm births resulted in 0.74 million deaths in 2013 down from 1.57 million in 1990. The chance of survival at fewer than 23 weeks is close to...\\n\\n- Photodynamic therapy (PDT), sometimes called photochemotherapy, is a form of phototherapy involving light and a photosensitizing chemical substance, used in conjunction with molecular oxygen to elicit cell death (phototoxicity). PDT has proven ability to kill microbial cells, including bacteria, fungi and viruses.\\nPDT is popularly used in treating acne. It is used clinically to treat a wide range of medical conditions, including wet age-related macular degeneration, psoriasis, atherosclerosis and has shown some efficacy in anti-viral treatments, including herpes. It also treats malignant cancers including head and neck, lung, bladder and particular skin. \\nThe technology has also been tested for treatment of prostate cancer, both in a dog model and in prostate cancer patients.\\n\\n- Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent.\\nRisk factors for glaucoma include increased pressure in the eye, a family history of the condition, migraines, high blood pressure, and obesity. For eye pressures a value of greater than is often used with higher pressures leading to a greater risk. However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma. The mechanism of open-angle glaucoma is believed to be slow exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork while in closed-angle glaucoma the iris blocks the trabecular meshwork. Diagnosis is by a dilated eye examination. Often the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping.\\nIf treated early it is possible to slow or stop the progression of disease with medication, laser treatment, or surgery. The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure. A number of different classes of glaucoma medication are available. Laser treatments may be effective in both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. A number of types of glaucoma surgeries may be used in people who do not respond sufficiently to other measures. Treatment of closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency.\\nAbout 11 to 67 million people have glaucoma globally. The disease affects about 2 million people in the United States. It occurs more commonly among older people. Closed-angle glaucoma is more common in...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 's. robert morgan' exhibits the relationship of 'medical condition'.

In the second group of 32 patients, the patella was realigned within its groove to alter tracking of the patella to the proximal femoral condyles when necessary. Fish-mouthing technique and insertion of a drain after surgery were done. After a two-year follow-up examination, there were two failures and five complications. A third group of nine patients was treated with Ferguson's modification of Maquet's operation using a 1.25-cm tibial tubercle elevation through a transverse incision; two of the nine had complications, subsequently treated successfully by converting Ferguson's operation into the Maquet operation, as modified for Group II.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal√©vy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper M√©rim√©e. The opera was first performed by the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences.\\nBizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the \\"Habanera\\" from act 1 and the \\"Toreador Song\\" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.\\nThe opera is written in the genre of op√©ra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don Jos√©, a na√Øve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. Jos√© abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous torero Escamillo, after which Jos√© kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.\\nAfter the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883. Thereafter, it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of op√©ra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.\\nThe music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters....","target":"Georges","rationale":"Based on the context, Georges Bizet was a French composer who wrote an opera called Carmen.

The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure.

Glass is used to make eyeglasses, microscopes, telescopes, and many other extremely useful and necessary objects.\\nUntil the Second World War, most of the glass used for optical  instruments was imported from Europe. However, during the war Americans could not get European glass, and they were forced to make their own. Therefore, new kinds of glasses were developed that had been previously unknown. These new effects were achieved by mixing other chemical elements with the sand. Some of these new glasses are very strong and can resist many kinds of shocks. Legend has it that a very hard glass was invented by a Roman who showed his discovery to the Emperor. When the Emperor saw the glass he feared that it would become more valuable than gold and sliver, making his treasure worthless. Therefore, he had the glassmaker killed, and the secret was not discovered again for hundreds of years.\\nIn the present century, safety glass was invented for use in modern cars and planes.

The process of actually applying for citizenship is apparently a long, very expensive process with a low success rate, so that‚Äôs out of the question for her. I‚Äôm not gonna argue with people in the comments as I honestly do not have more knowledge on the subject.\\n\\nHer roommate, we‚Äôll call her D, agreed to marry her, probably back in April 2018. They already live together, D is a very socially-dependent person and very attached to her, my friend seems to be the only one who can balance out D‚Äôs personality, and they‚Äôre both low-key gay for each other though they won‚Äôt admit it. It‚Äôs perfect.\\n\\nExcept D has abandonment issues that present in the form of commitment anxiety, and she‚Äôs also afraid her parents will absolutely lose it if she marries her friend. She doesn‚Äôt want to be disowned. So she still hasn‚Äôt told them she‚Äôs marrying this friend. She tried bringing it up to her parents once, that this friend either needed to marry her or me, and her mother said something like ‚Äúwell I guess she‚Äôs marrying \\\\[TheAllMightiest\\\\], then.‚Äù\\n\\nSo D keeps not telling her parents. And she‚Äôs been not telling her parents for months and months, and time‚Äôs running out. It‚Äôs making my friend and I nervous, especially my friend. In September, worried that D would back out and this friend would get deported, I told her I would marry her if D backed out. I genuinely don‚Äôt want her to get deported, platonic marriage is a huge life goal for me, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about my family‚Äôs opinion. And at that point, I had no other major life plans in the works. I was content with the idea of platonic-marrying her.\\n\\nFast-forward to now. My friend only has about a month left before she needs to be hitched to someone. D still hasn‚Äôt told her parents, throws a fit about how she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt deal with this stress right now‚Äù every time my friend and I try to get her to either tell her parents or just back the hell out fully. I‚Äôm worried she will continue procrastinating until the last minute, have a breakdown over it, and then back out entirely.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the last several months, I‚Äôve really hit it off with someone. We were already friends, but we‚Äôve been talking more and more, discovering we have the same life goals, and we really enjoy each other‚Äôs company. What started off as joking about platonic marriage has turned into actual, genuine ‚Äúwe could do this???? oh my god????‚Äù I am in love with the idea of platonic marrying this person, getting a house with them, fostering children with them. They are reciprocal in their excitement. They keep bringing it up. It's obviously not a done deal as marriage is a huge commitment, but I want the opportunity to have that life with them.\\n\\nBut now I might be expected to green-card marry my friend.\\n\\nIf D backs out, AITA for going back on my word and not green-card marrying my friend? I'm asking the internet because I already feel like a huge A-hole just thinking about telling her and I want other's opinions.","target":"yes","rationale":"The person who needs the green card is unwilling to accept responsibility for getting married, and instead is putting pressure on others to do it. It is unethical to put pressure on others to make a decision that carries significant consequences. The author's friend wants her roommate, D, to green-card marry her. However, D has not told her parents she will be getting married because she fears they will disown her if they find out she plans on marrying a woman. Instead of being honest with them and telling them about it or telling my friend that she doesn't want to get married, D keeps procrastinating and not making up her mind until the last minute. If she waits too long, there might not be time left for my friend or my friends' other option (the author) before their visa expires.\\\\nIt would also be unethical for the author's roommate (D) to back out at the last minute just because it was too stressful for her when so much depends upon having a green card in time before their visa expires.

After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3. The Lions responded with two consecutive defensive touchdowns: first a 34-yard interception return by Bobby Carpenter, then a 56-yard pick-6 by Chris Houston. The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter). The Lions defense held off Dallas for the win. Like the previous week, the Lions came back and won it in the final moments of the game after being down by a large margin at halftime. This was also the largest comeback the Dallas Cowboys have ever allowed, and it is the largest comeback by a road team in NFL history as the Cowboys were up by 24 in the 3rd quarter. It was the first time the Lions started 4-0 since 1980. This also was its franchise-record fifth straight road win.

More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius for political reasons and also during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of Arab raids in Cyprus, more arrived by the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the Kingdom of Cilicia was established. Between 1136-1138, Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus moved the entire population of the Armenian city of Tell Hamdun to Cyprus.

The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place. Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmany of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles‚ÄìSalt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action.

Tampa Bay sailed off to a good start in the first quarter with a 20-yard touchdown run from running back Cadillac Williams.  However, the Panthers would tie the game in the second quarter with running back DeAngelo Williams getting a 20-yard touchdown run. During the second quarter, punt returner Clifton Smith left the game due to a concussion caused by Panthers cornerback Dante Wesley ramming into Smith.  Wesley was flagged for unnecessary roughness and was ejected. Carolina would take the lead in the third quarter with quarterback Jake Delhomme completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeff King and running back Jonathan Stewart getting a 26-yard touchdown, yet the Buccaneers immediately got themselves back into the game as rookie wide receiver Sammie Stroughter returned the kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay tied the game with safety Tanard Jackson's 26-yard interception return for a touchdown.

While in his first year studying at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the neck down after a diving accident, severing the spinal cord at C5. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, and later developing a career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. He was a weekly panelist on PBS news program Inside Washington from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013.\\nContext: Meg Greenfield, editorial page editor for The Washington Post who edited Krauthammer's columns for 15 years, called his weekly column \\"independent and hard to peg politically. It's a very tough column. There's no 'trendy' in it. You never know what is going to happen next.\\" Hendrik Hertzberg, also a former colleague of Krauthammer while they worked at The New Republic in the 1980s, said that when the two first met in 1978, Krauthammer was \\"70 percent Mondale liberal, 30 percent 'Scoop Jackson Democrat,' that is, hard-line on Israel and relations with the Soviet Union\\"; in the mid-1980s, he was still \\"50-50: fairly liberal on economic and social questions but a full-bore foreign-policy neoconservative.\\" Hertzberg now calls Krauthammer a \\"pretty solid 90-10 Republican.\\" Krauthammer has been described by some as a conservative.  Krauthammer's major monograph on foreign policy, \\"Democratic Realism: An American Foreign Policy for a Unipolar World,\\" is critical both of the neoconservative Bush doctrine for being too expansive and utopian, and of foreign policy \\"realism\\" for being too narrow and immoral; instead, he proposes an alternative he calls \\"Democratic Realism.\\" In a 2005 speech (later published in Commentary Magazine) he called neoconservatism \\"a governing ideology whose time has come.\\" He noted that the original \\"fathers of neoconservatism\\" were \\"former liberals or leftists.\\"  More recently, they have been joined by \\"realists, newly mugged by reality\\" such as Condoleezza Rice, Richard Cheney, and George W. Bush, who \\"have given weight to neoconservatism, making it more diverse and, given the newcomers' past experience, more mature.\\" In \\"Charlie Gibson's Gaffe\\" in The Washington Post, September 13, 2008, Krauthammer elaborated on the changing meanings of the Bush Doctrine in light of Gibson's questioning of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin regarding what exactly the Bush Doctrine was, which resulted in criticism of Palin's response. Krauthammer states that the phrase originally referred to \\"the unilateralism that characterized the pre-9/11 first year of the Bush administration,\\" but elaborates, \\"There is no single meaning of the Bush doctrine. In fact, there have been four distinct meanings, each one succeeding another over the eight years of this administration.\\"  Krauthammer refused to vote for Donald Trump, and believes there is evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government.\\nQuestion: What did Condoleezza Rice and Richard Cheney do?. Whats the answer?","target":"have given weight to neoconservatism, making it more diverse and, given the newcomers' past experience, more mature.","rationale":"In the context, Condoleezza Rice and Richard Cheney are referred to as \\"\\"newcomers\\"\\" in relation to neoconservatism.

The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than $450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The $175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied. Funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective orders remains in place, said Milne and Stewart Ralphs, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake.
