Arbanon had long been an autonomous principality within Epirus, and the Nicaean conquest around 1255 was resented. The rebellion was a reaction to the imposition of Nicaean rule in the person of governor Constantine Chabaron. The rebels were active in Durrë, Ohrid, Debar and Mat. The Nicaean forces were under the command of George Akropolites, who described the events himself in his history. In the autumn of 1257, Akropolites left Thessaloniki and by way of Kastoria entered Kounavia, Mat and Debar in an effort to convince the local chieftains to abandon the Despot of Epirus, Michael II, and submit to imperial rule. Yet, in February 1258 the Nicaean garrisons were annihilated. Taking advantage of the situation, Michael II started his campaign against the Nicaeans and captured Chabaron in Kanina. The Albanians drove back the imperial troops sent as reinforcements and Akropolites set fresh troops in the move, opening his way to Ohrid and Prespa, but without having a chance to engage the rebels in the inner regions. He was forced to return to Prilep and fell captive to Michael II. The revolt was suppressed after troops from Asia Minor were sent in the spring of 1259, headed by John Komnenos. The most decisive battle was fought in the city of Devol.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time.

Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade. He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997.\\n\\nIn August 2005 author Lewis Perdue unsuccessfully sued Brown for plagiarism, on the basis of claimed similarity between The Da Vinci Code and his novels, The Da Vinci Legacy (1983) and Daughter of God (2000). Judge George Daniels said, in part: \\"A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that The Da Vinci Code is substantially similar to Daughter of God.\\"  In April 2006 Brown's publisher, Random House, won a copyright infringement case brought by authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, who claimed that Brown stole ideas from their 1982 book Holy Blood Holy Grail for his 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code. It was in the book Holy Blood Holy Grail that Baigent, Leigh, and co-author Henry Lincoln had advanced the theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had a child and that the bloodline continues to this day. Brown apparently alluded to the two authors' names in his book. Leigh Teabing, a lead character in both the novel and the film, uses Leigh's name as the first name, and anagrammatically derives his last name from Baigent's. Mr Justice Peter Smith found in Brown's favor in the case, and as a private amusement, embedded his own Smithy code in the written judgment.  On March 28, 2007, Brown's publisher, Random House, won an appeal copyright infringement case. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the efforts from Baigent and Leigh, who became liable for paying legal expenses of nearly US$6 million.  Brown has been sued twice in U.S. Federal courts by the author Jack Dunn who claims Brown copied a huge part of his book The Vatican Boys to write The Da Vinci Code (2006-07) and Angels & Demons (2011-12).

Passage 1:The Midnight Ghost Train was originally formed by Steve Moss in Buffalo, NY. The band's name comes partially from a Hank William's song lyric in I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry. TMGT's first release was \\"Johnny Boy EP\\" in 2008, and in 2009 they self-released their first full length album which was self-titled. The album was self-recorded in their home studio after the band relocated to Kansas. They followed up with their 2012 album \\"Buffalo\\", released on Karate Body Records. It was recorded entirely analog by Dave Barbe in Athens, Georgia. Displaying the band's delta blues influences, the album features a Lead Belly cover of Cotton Fields done a cappella. In 2013, TMGT performed at the Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands, and released \\"Live at Roadburn 2013\\" shortly thereafter. After losing their previous bass player, they went through several lineup changes before finding permanent bassist Mike Boyne. In 2014, TMGT signed with the Austrian based metal label, Napalm Records, which released TMGT's \\"Cold Was The Ground\\" on February 28, 2015. The album had a much faster tempo than previous releases, with more emphasis on song construction. The release boosted their popularity allowing them to appear at major festivals such as Hellfest and Graspop Metal Meeting. Napalm released their fourth full length album \\"Cypress Ave.\\" on July 28, 2017. Once again progressing into a more mature sound with a wide array of genres. Including a hip hop track featuring Sonny Cheeba from Camp Lo. TMGT has been most commonly described as hard rock, and related to bands like Kyuss, Black Sabbath, and Clutch. The band built the majority of their fan base from consistent touring, and exciting live performances. In 2018 TMGT called it quits in order to focus more on family life, after playing their last show at the Maryland Doom Fest.\\n Passage 2:Goswami was born in Guwahati, Assam on 7 March 1973 to an Assamese family.

Goswami's father is Colonel (Retd.) Manoranjan Goswami and his mother is Suprabha Gain-Goswami. Manoranjan has been a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party and contested the 1998 Lok Sabha Polls as the BJP candidate for the Guwahati to Lok Sabha of Assam where he was defeated by Congress candidate Bhubaneshwar Kalita.

However, in 1086 the Domesday Book indicated that Wigginton had not been gifted to him but was probably acquired by force by Robert from two adjacent estates close to Tring, one of which had previously been in the hands of Edith of Wessex. During the 13th century Wigginton formed part of the estate at Little Gaddesden passing first to the de Broc family and then, through marriage to the de Lucys. After the death of Sir William Lucy in 1466 it was in the ownership of the Corbets for over 130 years. The manor was then the subject of successive legal challenges fought out in the Court of Chancery until it came into the possession of Sir Richard Anderson of the manor of Pendley during the 1650s. Elizabeth Spencer (née Anderson) inherited Wigginton and became the third wife of Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt 1703. The manor remained in the Harcourt family until the 1860s. Colonel Charles Harcourt had died in 1831 leaving the manor to his three daughters, Sarah, Elizabeth and Alice who jointly sold it to Rev. James Williams in 1868.

Cyclin D1, an EGFR target gene, is frequently overexpressed in HNSCC, has been implicated in its pathogenesis, and is strongly associated with poor prognosis in this disease. Therefore, we examined the relationship between deregulated cyclin D1 expression and sensitivity to gefitinib to determine whether this frequently occurring oncogenic change affected the cellular response to gefitinib.', 'A panel of six EGFR-overexpressing HNSCC cell lines was used to correlate CCND1 gene copy number, cyclin D1 expression, and response to gefitinib. The effect of constitutive overexpression of cyclin D1 was assessed by establishing stably transfected clonal SCC-9 cell lines.', 'Three of six cell lines displayed cyclin D1 amplification and/or overexpression, and these cell lines were resistant to gefitinib. SCC 9 clones overexpressing cyclin D1 continued to proliferate and maintained their S-phase fraction when treated with gefitinib, whereas empty vector control clones and the parental SCC 9 cells were profoundly inhibited and displayed marked reductions in S-phase. The resistance of cyclin D1-overexpressing clones and cyclin D1-amplified cell lines was associated with maintenance of cyclin D1 expression after gefitinib treatment.\\nAnswer: These data suggest that deregulated cyclin D1 overexpression may be associated with resistance of HNSCC to EGFR inhibitors. Therefore, the role of cyclin D1 as a marker of therapeutic response and its utility as a prognostic marker in HNSCC warrant additional analysis.","target":"Is deregulated cyclin D1 expression associated with decreased efficacy of the selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines?","rationale":"The given answer presents the relationship between cyclin D1 expression and sensitivity to gefitinib.

A given mass of water releases more than five times as much heat for a 1°C temperature change as does the same mass of limestone or granite. Consequently, coastal regions of our planet tend to have less variable climates than regions in the center of a continent. After absorbing large amounts of thermal energy from the sun in summer, the water slowly releases the energy during the winter, thus keeping coastal areas warmer than otherwise would be expected (Figure 5.13 \\"The High Specific Heat of Liquid Water Has Major Effects on Climate\\"). Water’s capacity to absorb large amounts of energy without undergoing a large increase in temperature also explains why swimming pools and waterbeds are usually heated. Heat must be applied to raise the temperature of the water to a comfortable level for swimming or sleeping and to maintain that level as heat is exchanged with the surroundings. Moreover, because the human body is about 70% water by mass, a great deal of energy is required to change its temperature by even 1°C. Consequently, the mechanism for maintaining our body temperature at about 37°C does not have to be as finely tuned as would be necessary if our bodies were primarily composed of a substance with a lower specific heat.

Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his...","target":"Cooke","rationale":"The description above explains how Mahler wrote his Seventh Symphony.

Research in the sixties found the opposite. Bilingual people scored higher than monolinguals, people who speak only one language. So which is it?\\nResearchers presented their newest studies last month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The latest evidence shows that being bilingual does not necessarily make people smarter. But researcher Ellen Bialystok says it probably does make you better at certain skills.\\nEllen Bialystok said, \\"Imagine driving down the highway. There're many things that could\\ncapture your attention and you really need to be able to monitor all of them. Why would bilingualism make you any better at that?\\"\\nAnd the answer, she says, is that bilingual people are often better at controlling their attention -- a function called the executive control system.\\nMs. Bialystok is a psychology professor at York University in Toronto, Canada. She says the best method to measure the executive control system is called the Stroop Test. A person is shown words in different color1s. The person has to ignore the word but say the color1. The .problem is that the words are all names of color1s.\\nEllen Bialystok said, \\"So you would have the word blue written in red, but you have to say red. But blue is so salient , it's just lighting up all these circuits  in your brain, and you really want to say blue. So you need a mechanism  to  _ that so that you can say red. That's the executive control system.\\"\\nHer work shows that bilingual people continually practice this function. They have to, because both languages are active in their brain at the same time. They need to suppress  one to be able to speak in the other.\\nThis mental exercise might help in other ways, too. Researchers say bilingual children are better able to separate a word from its meaning, and more likely to have friends from different\\ncultures. Bilingual adults are often four to five years later...\\nQuestion: In the Stroop Test, supposing you have the word yellow written in white, you will have to say   _  .\\nOptions: A: white\\nB: yellow\\nC: blue\\nD: red","target":"A","rationale":"The article mentions the Stroop Test, which is a method to measure executive control.

His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity.\\n\\nand a hint : To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis.

Fram left Christiania on 24 June 1893, seen on her way by a cannon salute from the fort and the cheers of thousands of well-wishers. This was the first of a series of farewells as Fram sailed round the coast and moved northward, reaching Bergen on 1 July (where there was a great banquet in Nansen's honour), Trondheim on 5 July and Tromsø, north of the Arctic Circle, a week later.  The last Norwegian port of call was Vardø, where Fram arrived on 18 July.  After the final provisions were taken on board, Nansen, Sverdrup, Hansen and Blessing spent their last hours ashore in a sauna, being beaten with birch twigs by two young girls.The first leg of the journey eastward took Fram across the Barents Sea towards Novaya Zemlya and then to the North Russian settlement of Khabarova where the first batch of dogs was brought on board.  On 3 August Fram weighed anchor and moved cautiously eastward, entering the Kara Sea the next day. Few ships had sailed the Kara Sea before, and charts were incomplete. On 18 August, in the area of the Yenisei River delta, an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander. Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned. The crew also experienced the dead water phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by energy dissipation caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water. On 9 September a wide stretch of ice-free water opened up, and next day Fram rounded Cape Chelyuskin—the second ship to do so, after Nordenskiöld's...","target":"Sverdrup Island","rationale":"The article mentions that an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander.

Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old.\\n\\nUsher developed a friendship with American record producer, Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; the record led to his popularity reaching in the country. It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album's second single, \\"Nice & Slow\\", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States.  \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States.  Usher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto.  Usher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was slated to be released in early 2001. The first single, \\"Pop Ya Collar\\", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles \\"U Remind Me\\" and \\"U Got It Bad\\" each topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States.  Usher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \\"U Remind Me\\". The next year, he won the same award for \\"U Don't Have to Call\\", making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In summer 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy's \\"I Need a Girl, Part I\\". The year closed out with a trio of TV series appearances, all in November, on The Twilight Zone, 7th Heaven, Moesha, and American Dreams, the latter in which Usher portrayed Marvin Gaye.  On October 16, 2015, Usher released an interactive music video exclusively on the music streaming platform Tidal called \\"Chains\\" that featuring artist Nas and Bibi Bourelly. \\"Chains\\" literally forces the viewer to confront the issue of racial profiling and police brutality head-on: By utilizing the webcam on the viewer's computer as well as facial recognition technology, \\"Chains\\" paused mid-song whenever the viewer's eyes deviate from the video. Usher performed the song for the first time at the Tidal X:1020 concert on October 20, 2015, at Brooklyn's Barclays Arena. On January 14, 2016, after continual delays of his eighth album, Usher announced via Daniel Arsham Instagram post that he changed the title of the album from UR to Flawed. It was scheduled to be released in April 2016, but has been pushed back with no release date. On June 9, 2016, Usher released a new single from his expected forthcoming album Flawed on the music streaming platform Tidal titled \\"No Limit\\" featuring Young Thug, along with a second single titled \\"Crash\\" on June 10 for all digital platforms.  On June 12, 2016, it was reported that Raymond signed a management deal with business partner Scooter Braun. Braun already represented Justin Bieber and had a joint venture with Raymond and Bieber. This report was confirmed by Usher during a sit down interview with Ryan Seacrest at the 73rd annual Cannes Festival on June 21, 2016. Usher furthered his acting career, starring as American former professional boxer Sugar Ray Leonard in the 2016 American-Panamanian biographical sports film Hands of Stone about the career of Panamanian former professional boxer Roberto Duran.

On September 13, 2016, both \\"Missin U\\" and \\"Rivals\\" were sent to radio as the album's third and fourth singles.  The album Hard II Love was released on September 16, 2016, and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. It debuted at number 5 on the US Billboard 200, and sold 28,000 copies in the United States in its first week. It also became his seventh consecutive top ten album in the United States. The lead single, \\"No Limit\\" featuring rapper Young Thug initially was serviced to Urban radio on June 9, and eventually peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 9 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.

According to the list, \\"password\\" is the worst and most common password. Many others on the list are numbers in order either forward (for example,1234) or backward. Letters on the keyboard in order, such as \\"qwerty\\" are also common, as well as some first names and animals. \\"Hackers can easily break into many accounts  just by trying common passwords again and again, \\" said Morgan Slain, CEO of Splash Data.\\nHow can you make a strong password? It should be eight characters or more, with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. One way to create a long and easy-to-remember password is to separate short words with spaces or numbers. Having safe passwords is necessary for surfing the Internet safely. But it's not the only thing you must do to keep safety online. Here are some other web safety tips:\\n*Never give out information that will allow someone to find you offline. That includes your full name, address and phone number.\\n*Don't include your real name as part of your online screen name.\\n*Never meet people you met on the Internet in person.

His family had migrated to California as many other families from the United States due to the California Gold Rush. His father, Joseph \\"Joe\\" Hooper, was born in Morrell, Prince Edward Island in Canada. Joe was the fourth child and second boy born to English-born William Hooper, Harry's grandfather, and his Portuguese wife Louisa.\\n\\nBefore the 1921 season, the media questioned whether Hooper would re-sign with the Red Sox for the coming season, saying that Hooper may have been disappointed not to be given an opportunity at manager. Since 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee had been getting rid of expensive veteran players in what has been called a \\"fire-sale\\". Hooper was traded to the Chicago White Sox in March 1921 in exchange for Shano Collins and Nemo Leibold. Newspaper accounts said that Hooper had not been warned about the trade, that he would demand a higher salary from the White Sox and that he was prepared not to play unless the team met his demands.  Hooper had some of his best offensive production with the White Sox. He hit over .300 in three out of the five seasons he spent with the team and he hit a career-high 11 home runs and 80 runs batted in during the 1922 season. In 1922 and again in 1924, Hooper was involved in eight double plays, which led the league for outfielders in both of those seasons. In 1925, Hooper asked for his release from Chicago so that he could pursue a position as a manager.  Hooper was a career .281 hitter with 75 home runs, 817 RBI, 1429 runs, 2466 hits, 389 doubles, 160 triples, and 375 stolen bases in 2309 games. He holds the Red Sox franchise records for most triples (130) and stolen bases (300), as well as Fenway Park records for triples (63) and stolen bases(107). Hooper is only one of two players (Heinie Wagner being the other) to be a part of four Red Sox World Series championships.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school.

Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour.

Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.\\nTo create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.\\nFollowing the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company.

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground.

The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.\\n\\nand the situation: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.\\n\\nAnswer the following question: In which organism cellular respiration would occur, sample A or sample B?","target":"sample A","rationale":"According to the background information, cellular respiration occurs when energy is converted from glucose into ATP molecules.

Cell adhesion to extracellular matrices (ECM) has also been proposed to activate Rho, but this point has been controversial due to the difficulty of distinguishing changes in Rho activity from the structural contributions of ECM to the formation of focal adhesions. To address these questions, we established an assay for GTP-bound cellular Rho. Plating Swiss 3T3 cells on fibronectin-coated dishes elicited a transient inhibition of Rho, followed by a phase of Rho activation. The activation phase was greatly enhanced by serum. In serum-starved adherent cells, LPA induced transient Rho activation, whereas in suspended cells Rho activation was sustained. Furthermore, suspended cells showed higher Rho activity than adherent cells in the presence of serum. These data indicate the existence of an adhesion-dependent negative-feedback loop. We also observed that both cytochalasin D and colchicine trigger Rho activation despite their opposite effects on stress fibers and focal adhesions. Our results show that ECM, cytoskeletal structures and soluble factors all contribute to regulation of Rho activity.","target":"Regulation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho by cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nRegulation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho by cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and is Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres (250,900 sq mi) with a widely varied landscape, stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south.\\nAboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the late 17th century, fur traders arrived on two major river systems, what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system. A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert's Land. During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg. The assertion of Métis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba. There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province.\\nManitoba's capital and largest city, Winnipeg, is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada.

Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not.

Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. Many modern trombone models also utilize a rotary valve as a means to lower pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves like those on the trumpet.\\n\\n- A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. \\n\\n- Don Lang ( born Gordon Langhorn , 19 January 1925 -- 3 August 1992 ) was an English trombone player and singer , who led his own band , Don Lang & his Frantic Five .\\n\\n- The embouchure is the use of facial muscles and the shaping of the lips to the mouthpiece of woodwind instruments or the mouthpiece of the brass instruments. The word is of French origin and is related to the root \\"bouche\\" (fr.), 'mouth'. The proper embouchure allows the instrumentalist to play the instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to one's muscles.\\n\\n- A brass instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips. Brass instruments are also called \\"labrosones\\", literally meaning \\"lip-vibrated instruments\\".\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'don lang ' and 'jazz'?","target":"genre","rationale":"The genre of music known as jazz originated in the United States, specifically New Orleans.

Not long before his birth, his parents had moved from his father's native Ireland to Cornwall, where his mother came from, in order for his father to find work as a policeman. Fitzsimmons received his early education at the National school in Helston. In 1873, the family moved again; James, Jane and their youngest five children sailed on the Adamant for the 93 day journey to Lyttelton, New Zealand.\\n\\nIn 1896, Fitzsimmons won a disputed version of the World Heavyweight Championship in a fight in Langtry, Texas, against the Irish fighter Peter Maher. On 17 March 1897, in Carson City, Nevada, he knocked out American Jim Corbett, generally recognised as the legitimate World Heavyweight Champion (having won the title from John L. Sullivan in 1892) in round 14. This constituted a remarkable achievement, as Jim Corbett, a skilled boxer, weighed one stone 3 pounds (17 lb) more than Fitzsimmons. He out-boxed Fitzsimmons for several rounds, knocked him down in the sixth round and badly damaged his face with his jab, left hook and right hand, but Fitzsimmons kept coming and Corbett began to tire. In the 14th round, Fitzsimmons won the title with his \\"solar plexus\\" punch. Corbett collapsed in agony. Fitzsimmons' \\"solar plexus\\" punch became legendary, although he himself may never have used the phrase. The entire fight was filmed by Enoch J. Rector and released to cinemas as The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight, the longest film ever released at the time. Using her maiden name, it was covered by Nellie Verrill Mighels Davis, the first woman to report a prize fight.  Fitzsimmons spent the rest of 1897 and 1898 doing stage tours. In 1899, Fitzsimmons fought James J. Jeffries at the Coney Island Athletic Club near Brooklyn, New York. Most people gave Jeffries little chance, even though at over 15 stones (95 kg) he massively outweighed his opponent and was far younger, but Jeffries lifted the World Heavyweight Champion from Fitzsimmons with an 11th-round knockout.  In June 1901 Fitzsimmons took part in a wrestling match against Gus Ruhlin. He lost and went back to boxing. He then enjoyed legitimate boxing knockouts of leading contenders Ruhlin and Tom Sharkey.  In 1901 he published a book Physical Culture and Self-Defense (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment.

When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461.\\n\\nRichard's Council of the North, described as his \\"one major institutional innovation\\", derived from his ducal council following his own viceregal appointment by Edward IV; when Richard himself became king, he maintained the same conciliar structure in his absence. It officially became part of the royal council machinery under the presidency of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in April 1484, based at Sandal Castle in Wakefield. It is considered to have greatly improved conditions for northern England, as it was, in theory at least, intended to keep the peace and punish law breakers, as well as resolving land disputes. Bringing regional governance directly under the control of central government, it has been described as the king's \\"most enduring monument\\", surviving unchanged until 1641.  In December 1483, Richard instituted what later became known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal representation could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.  Richard's death at Bosworth resulted in the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, which had ruled England since the succession of Henry II in 1154. The last legitimate male Plantagenet, Richard's nephew, Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of Richard III's brother Clarence), was executed by Henry VII in 1499. The only extant direct male line of Plantagenets is the House of Beaufort, headed today by Henry Somerset, 12th Duke of Beaufort.

At this time, the Smashing Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement, with Corgan protesting, \\"We've graduated now from 'the next Jane's Addiction' to 'the next Nirvana', now we're 'the next Pearl Jam'.\\"  Amid this environment of intense internal pressure for the band to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record so far away from their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened to the point where he contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.  Despite all the problems in its recording, Siamese Dream debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 chart, and sold over four million copies in the U.S. alone. Alongside the band's mounting mainstream recognition, the band's reputation as careerists among their former peers in the independent music community was worsened. Indie rock band Pavement's 1994 song \\"Range Life\\" directly mocks the band in its lyrics, although Stephen Malkmus, lead singer of Pavement, has stated, \\"I never dissed their music. I just dissed their status.\\" Former Husker Du frontman Bob Mould called them \\"the grunge Monkees\\", and fellow Chicago musician/producer Steve Albini wrote a scathing letter in response to an article praising the band, derisively comparing them to REO Speedwagon (\\"by, of and for the mainstream\\") and concluding their ultimate insignificance. The opening track and lead single of Siamese Dream, \\"Cherub Rock\\", directly addresses Corgan's feud with the \\"indie-world\\".

It felt manipulative and I couldn't really process anything at all anymore so I told her she needed to leave me alone. \\n\\nI blocked her from my phone and that's really the only way to get a hold of me. She has my main email address and I never let it get out of control but shes never emailed. I could no longer handle the instability and unpredictability of her meltdowns. I think I had recently told her that and then like a day later a meltdown happened. It was like she was pretending not to hear me and would specifically do what I told her stressed me out.\\n\\nFast forward 1 year ago:\\n\\nThere was another wedding and literally, everyone was invited. I hadn't talked to my mother since the last one. I didn't sit with her at the ceremony or the after thing (the dance/ eating/ party thing after the church. I get confused on the terms, sorry.). I got pretty drunk and I think I started talking to her about my 17 years younger half-brother. He's basically illiterate and now aged in the double digits. I think she left shortly after? I know another aunt came over and tried to reconcile differences at some point. Deciding she would mediate but I think she had chosen to fight for my mom so not true meditation.  I know I got way drunk I can't remember much? I don't think I talked to my mom during this time through text.\\n\\nWithin a week:\\n\\nI've been doing great! I was constantly a nervous wreck most of my life. I always had terrible acne but I've been getting good sleep and eating well. My face is clear, I make great grades, and I'm making friends.\\n\\nI play Fortnite with my little brother and he has expressed that he planned on going to graduation. I texted my mother at the start of this semester, my senior year, to start coordinating plans for graduation. Earlier last week I texted her and asked if it would be okay to call, she agreed. The phone call went well. She was acting very nervous at first but I can't really guess why. She was like almost expecting a certain thing but sounded generally happy. I think she thought I was calling because I was like dying or something? I ended up having to hang up because of a quick emergency. So, I texted her back 5 minutes later and said it was good talking to you and said sorry for just springing up out of nowhere to talk. She responded with a massive text talking about how much I hurt her and that she'll remember these things \\"until the day I die\\" saying she left the most recent wedding early because of me. I accepted fault and said I was pretty drunk. Then it was just text after text of her resaying all the same stuff and not really listening to what I had to say. Similar to the last time we texted and maybe as it has always been?\\n\\nI recently read a book, the laws of human nature, and I have been considering peoples backgrounds when how they act. I have learned to understand my mother's behavior and I was trying to forgive her. I don't want to act the way she acts. This book explains it is very likely I will fall into the same habits if I don't stay conscious about it. I don't know why I reached out, I guess it's my mom. I want to be able to have a stable relationship.  \\n\\nAnyway, I asked my mom if it would be okay if I visit over the current winter break. She started sending all the texts about how disrespectful I was and that there need to be rules I have to accept if I'm to see my little brother. Honestly, it has been two years and she had acted cool in the texts earlier this semester about coming to graduation. Well, I didn't like the tone of the conversation so I said we would go back to not talking. She started being whishy-washy and tried to make it sound like it was her idea to not talk? Idk it sounds petty but I think it is relevant to say it was my choice.\\n\\nPrevious 24 hours:\\n\\nShe is obviously pissed and was talking about years of grief. When I expressed one thing specifically that she constantly makes me feel bad about she acted as if she was never mad about that and made it seem like it was actually me who was mad over this event 14 years in the past. She graduated from college and moved me into my dads while she lived with the aunt I mentioned earlier. I decided to stay with my dad once she got an apartment and shes always told me how it hurt her and never accepts an apology for it. I mentioned this grievance and she made it seem like she was never mad about me staying with my dad and that she thought I was the one mad this whole time. Like what do I even have to be mad about that I stayed living with my dad?\\n\\nI decided to uninvite her to my graduation. It is way too much stress. She hasn't helped me with the price of a cheeseburger since I started. She never really makes me feel good about myself. I just don't want to talk to her at all anymore. I've started a new book about surviving psychological abuse and she is a textbook abuser. \\\\*cue I can see clearly now\\\\*. \\n\\nI texted her and I think I'll just copy paste? me: Well, I put a lot of thought into it. I don’t want you at my graduation. I’m no longer interested in maintaining a relationship. You had a lot of terrible things to say and if I ever try to explain how you make me feel you minimize or ignore it maybe you say I have the wrong memory all-together. Anyway, I don’t wanna deal with it anymore. I was really trying to be nice when I reached out, you’re very angry. I think you project a lot so I feel like I sound like you when I’m trying to explain what you do but that’s for you to figure out! Bye I guess \\n\\nHer: You know what Erick, I’m done with you son. You’ve been so disrespectful and shitty towards me since you were about 11. You’ve got issues, and you need to grow up! I’m a good mom and was a “great” mom to you. You totally don’t deserve me. Thank God I have \\\\[little bro\\\\] because if all I had as a reference as a mom and you were my only child I’d probably have shot myself. Don’t contact me again.\\n\\nSo, grand-finale, my mother just told me she would have killed herself if I was her only son and that I've been terrible since I was 11? Who gets mad at an 11-year-old. She has a social work degree, I would think they tell you it is never the child's fault?\\n\\nI think I'm better off. I think she's being manipulative and knows full well what she does.\\n\\nTL;DR  First, I think you need to read it all, I know I needed to write it! Haven't talked to my mom in 2 years. She hasn't talked with most of her family in as long or much much longer. I told her she is not invited to my college graduation and that I don't want to talk to her anymore. She said she would have killed herself if I was her only son and to not contact her anymore.\\n\\nJust here for the judgment.

Tom tilled his land, while Brad applied the no-till gardening method.\\n\\nHint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.","target":"Brad","rationale":"The paragraph above mentions that Brad applied the no-till gardening method, which means he did not till his land.

This is mainly due to the fact that all my friends have gone back to university due to classes starting on the 7th on January. Because I am on a co-op term, I have to stay in my home city which is hours away from my university. Basically, I'll have no friends to hang out with this year. \\n\\nBut y'see, I joined this nifty online Discord community so I thought that I would still be able to spend time with some close online friends. Unfortunately for me, many of them are also busy with school and exams and whatnot. However, one of my closer friends, let's refer to her as Sam, doesnt study a lot and spends most of her time playing League of Legends, which I also play with her often. So my birthday hits, I finish work and get home at 7pm where I expect to find Sam online. I see her playing some League of Legends as expected and I ask if she wants to play with me after I finish dinner. She agrees so I promptly head out to dinner so I can finish quicker and have time to play with her. Note: I sleep at 10:30pm due to an early work schedule and Sam is aware of this fact.\\n\\nSo I finish my birthday dinner and am heading back at around 8pm. I message her to reconfirm that she's available to play with me once I get home. She confirms this fact and I head home. So I get home at around 8:20 and I give Sam a call. She doesn't pick up so I wait in the empty call by myself for a couple minutes before me messages me saying that she will be home in a bit. I'm a bit taken aback by this because I wasn't even aware that she had gone out. So I just so \\"ok\\" and go watch some youtube for a bit. So fast forward half an hour and Sam has not messaged me since. I ask her what's up and she says she's still not home yet. At around 9pm, she finally msgs me to tell me she's home so I give her a call and get prepared to spend the rest of the day playing some League of Legends with Sam. Before she picks up she messages me \\"if ur too tired you can sleep and we can play another time\\". I'm completely dumbstruck by that statement and I got the impression that she lowkey didnt want to play so I quickly hang up the call. She notices that and tries to recover by saying \\"Oh unless you want to play today\\" but I'm not having any of it. Her lack of apologies for being late, lack of notice for her absence, and implying I sleep off my birthday pissed me off. I log off discord and am in such a bad state that I go to get some alcohol. It seems a bit pathetic but I was lonely and bored so I didn't really care at that point that I was drinking alone. Sam calls my phone a couple times and I ignore them and continue drinking because at that point we would only be able to squeeze 2 or 3 games in and in the mood I was in they wouldn't be any fun anyways. So I spent the rest of the day drinking my sorrows away.\\n\\nI wake up today and log back in on discord and I get a message from Sam saying \\"let's play league today!\\".

We argue for a bit with her saying I misunderstood her message and me just getting pissed at her for what she did yesterday.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians.

Terrapins do not form a taxonomic unit, and may not be related. Many belong to the families Geoemydidae and Emydidae. \\n\\n- China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\\n\\n- The turtle shell is a highly complicated shield for the ventral and dorsal parts of turtles, tortoises and terrapins (all classified as \\"turtles\\" by zoologists), completely enclosing all the vital organs of the turtle and in some cases even the head. It is constructed of modified bony elements such as the ribs, parts of the pelvis and other bones found in most reptiles. The bone of the shell consists of both skeletal and dermal bone, showing that the complete enclosure of the shell probably evolved by including dermal armor into the rib cage.\\n\\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- Tortoises are a family, Testudinidae, of land-dwelling reptiles in the order Testudines. Tortoises are shielded from predators by a shell. The top part of the shell is the carapace, the underside is the plastron, and the two are connected by the bridge. The carapace is fused to both the vertebrae and ribcage, and tortoises are unique among vertebrates in that the pectoral and pelvic girdles are inside the ribcage rather than outside. Tortoises can vary in size from a few centimeters to two meters. They are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally reclusive animals.\\n\\n- Testudinata is the group of all tetrapods with a true turtle shell . It includes both modern turtles ( Testudines ) and many of their extinct , shelled relatives ( stem - turtles ) . Though it was first coined as the group containing turtles by Klein in 1760 , it was first defined in the modern sense by Joyce and colleagues in 2004 . Testudinata does not include the primitive stem - turtle Odontochelys , which only had the bottom half of a shell .\\n\\n- Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country.

During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\").

The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".\\n\\n- The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.\\n\\n- Odontochelys semitestacea (meaning \\"toothed turtle with a half-shell\\") is a Late Triassic relative of turtles. Prior to the discovery of \\"Pappochelys\\" it was considered the oldest undisputed stem turtle. It is the only known species in the genus Odontochelys and the family Odontochelyidae. \\"O. semitestacea\\" was first described from three 220-million-year-old specimens excavated in Triassic deposits in Guizhou, China.\\n\\n- A dermal bone or membrane bone is a bony structure derived from intramembranous ossification forming components of the vertebrate skeleton including much of the skull, jaws, gill covers, shoulder girdle and fin spines rays (lepidotrichia), and the shell (of tortoises and turtles). In contrast to endochondral bone, dermal bone does not form from cartilage that then calcifies, and it is often ornamented.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \\nQuestion: Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago near Lisbon following the orders of which leader? \\nIs the correct answer Henry the Navigator?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The passage mentions that Zarco was sailing in the service of Prince Henry, who is also known as Henry The Navigator.

An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectic state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"paraelectric","rationale":"The question is asking for a potential crystalline form.

Due to Muslim successes in the Holy Land, the Order sought new missions in Europe. Duke Konrad I of Masovia in west-central Poland appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Prussians in 1226. After the subjugation of the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights fought against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians in the Battle of Saule in 1236, coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia, the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order, allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region. Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253, hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders' attacks, which it did not. The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue pagan Lithuania, which officially converted to  Christianity in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the 11-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. However, even after the country was officially converted, the crusades continued up until the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, when the Lithuanians and Poles, helped by the Tatars, Moldovans and the Czechs, defeated the Teutonic knights. The Teutonic Order's attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia , an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, accompanied the Northern Crusades. One of the major blows for the idea of the conquest of Russia was the Battle of the Ice in 1242. With or without the Pope's blessing, Sweden also undertook several crusades against Orthodox Novgorod.\\n\\nWhat happened first, the Battle of the Ice or Battle of Grunwald?","target":"Battle of Grunwald","rationale":"The goal of this problem is to compare the time when Battle of Grunwald and Battle of Ice happened.

But the fact was that these students were only average ,and they were not the best students at all. Well, guess what? At the end of the year, all the five average students scored among the highest in the class.\\nWhat made these average students change so much to become top students?The only difference was the change in their teachers' attitude . Because the teachers believed that these five kids were the top students,they expected  more from them. And so these five average students began to believe and expect more from themselves. So they worked harder to do as well as they could.\\nDo you know why? If you expect the best from people, they'll usually want to give you their best. A great leader said, \\"Treat  a person just how he appears to be on the outside, and you'll make him even worse. But treat a person like he's already a success,and you'll help make him the best he can be.\\"\\nLike the true story of 7-year-old Johnny, his teacher got so angry with him that one day she said,\\"Johnny,you're the naughtiest  boy in this class.

But do you know that I don't believe a word of it.\\" And every day after that, this new teacher treated Johnny as if he was one of the smartest students even when Johnny did naughty things. Later on, Johnny became a school leader.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: You are on vacation at the beach. You take your flip-flops off so you can go swimming. The sand is so hot it hurts your feet. You have to run to the water. Now imagine if it were hot enough for the sand to melt. Some places inside Earth are so hot that rock melts. Melted rock inside the Earth is called magma. Magma can be hotter than 1,000C. When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is known as lava, as Figure 3.17 shows. Minerals form when magma and lava cool. Most water on Earth, like the water in the oceans, contains elements. The elements are mixed evenly through the water. Water plus other substances makes a solution. The particles are so small that they will not come out when you filter the water. But the elements in water can form solid mineral deposits. Fresh water contains a small amount of dissolved elements. Salt water contains a lot more dissolved elements. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved substances. When the water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid layer of minerals, as Figure 3.18 shows. At this time, the particles come together to form minerals. These solids sink to the bottom. The amount of mineral formed is the same as the amount dissolved in the water. Seawater is salty enough for minerals to precipitate as solids. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California, or Utahs Great Salt Lake, can also precipitate salts. Salt easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite, as Figure 3.19 shows. The limestone towers in the figure are made mostly of the mineral calcite. The calcite was deposited in the salty and alkaline water of Mono Lake, in California. Calcium-rich spring water enters the bottom of the lake. The water bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The Underground water can be heated by magma. The hot water moves through cracks below Earths surface. Hot water can hold more dissolved particles than cold water. The hot, salty solution has chemical reactions with the rocks around it. The water picks up more dissolved particles. As it flows through open spaces in rocks, the water deposits solid minerals. When a mineral fills cracks in rocks, the deposits are called veins. Figure 3.20 shows a white quartz vein. When the minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals grow. These rocks are called geodes. Figure 3.20 shows a geode that was formed when amethyst crystals grew in an open space in a rock. \\n Question: Which type of feature may form in open spaces inside rocks?","target":"geode","rationale":"The text 'geode' is present in the context paragraph.

A well - educated and successful lawyer , he was repeatedly sent as envoy to Ostrogothic Italy in the prelude to the Gothic War of 535 -- 554 . Despite his diplomatic skill , he was not able to avert war , and was imprisoned by the Goths in Ravenna for a few years . Upon his release , he was appointed to the post of magister officiorum , head of the imperial secretariat , which he held for an unparalleled 26 years . In this capacity , he was one of the leading ministers of Emperor Justinian I ( r. 527 -- 565 ) , playing an important role in the Byzantine emperor 's religious policies and the relations with Sassanid Persia ; most notably he led the negotiations for the peace agreement of 562 that ended the 20 - year - long Lazic War . His historical writings survive only in fragments , but provide unique source material on early Byzantine ceremonies and diplomatic issues between Byzantium and the Sassanids .\\n\\n- The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.\\n\\n- A diploma (from Greek µ \\"díplma\\", meaning \\"folded paper\\") is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as a college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study, or (US) recording that an academic degree has been awarded. In some countries, e.g. the United Kingdom and Australia, the word diploma also refers to an academic award (e.g. diploma of higher education, graduate diploma, postgraduate diploma). Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document, thus diplomatic, diplomat and diplomacy via the \\"Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus\\".\\n\\n- A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it. Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Although \\"historian\\" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians, though, are recognized by publications or training and experience. \\"Historian\\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere.\\n\\n- An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used \\"honorific\\" for remarkable lawyers, such as in \\"Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili\\". The broad equivalent in many English law-based jurisdictions can be a \\"barrister\\". However, in Scottish, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, advocate is also a word to indicate lawyers of superior classification.\\n\\n- Justinian I  (482 14 November 565), traditionally known as Justinian the Great and also Saint Justinian the Great in the Eastern Orthodox Church, was a Byzantine (East Roman) emperor from 527 to 565. During his reign, Justinian sought to revive the empire's greatness and reconquer the lost western half of the historical Roman Empire. Justinian's rule constitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the Later Roman empire, and his reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized \\"renovatio imperii\\", or \\"restoration of the Empire\\".\\n\\n- The Kingdom of the Lombards also known as the Lombard Kingdom; later the Kingdom of (all) Italy, was an early medieval state established by the Lombards, a Germanic-speaking people, on the Italian Peninsula in the latter part of the 6th century. The king was traditionally elected by the highest-ranking aristocrats, the dukes, as several attempts to establish a hereditary dynasty failed. The kingdom was subdivided into a varying number of duchies, ruled by semi-autonomous dukes, which were in turn subdivided into gastaldates at the municipal level. The capital of the kingdom and the center of its political life was Pavia in the modern northern Italian region of Lombardy.\\n\\n- A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- Ravenna (also locally ) is the capital city of the Province of Ravenna, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. It was the capital city of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths until it was re-conquered in 540 by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Afterwards, the city formed the centre of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until the invasion of the Lombards in 751, after which it became the seat of the Kingdom of the Lombards.\\n\\n- The Sasanian Empire (or ), also known as Sassanian, Sasanid, Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire), known to its inhabitants as rnshahr in Middle Persian, was the last imperial dynasty in Persia (Iran) before the rise of Islam, ruled by and named after the Sasanian dynasty from 224 to 651 AD. The Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighboring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years.\\n\\n- The magister officiorum (Latin literally for \\"Master of Offices\\", in , \\"magistros tn offikin\\") was one of the most senior administrative officials in the late Roman Empire and the early centuries of the Byzantine Empire. In Byzantium, the office was eventually transformed into a senior honorary rank, until it disappeared in the 12th century.\\n\\n- History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.\\n\\n- Romagna (Romagnol: \\"Rumâgna\\") is an Italian historical region that approximately corresponds to the south-eastern portion of present-day Emilia-Romagna. Traditionally, it is limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region). The region has been recently formally expanded with the transfer of seven comuni (Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant'Agata Feltria, Talamello) from the Marche region, which are a small number of comuni where Romagnolo dialect is spoken.\\nEtymology.\\nThe name \\"Romagna\\" comes from the Latin name \\"Romània\\", which originally was the generic name for \\"land inhabited by Romans\\", and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century.\\nIt later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek).\\nThus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\".\\n\\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times.\\nHistory.\\nPrehistory.\\nA number of archaeological sites in the region, such as Monte Poggiolo, show that Romagna has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'peter the patrician' has the relation 'languages spoken or written' with?","target":"medieval greek","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"medieval greek\\"."},{"source":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: who was 1961 USC Trojans coach?","target":"John McKay","rationale":"In 1961, John McKay was the coach for USC Trojans."},{"source":"Question: when does the new american horror story series start??\\nAnswer:","target":"2018","rationale":"The new American Horror Story Series is expected to start in 2018."},{"source":"Where does an audience come every week to listen to a person speaking?\\n- hockey game\\n- church\\n- sporting event\\n- movie theater\\n- phone call\\n\\nThe best answer is","target":"church","rationale":"The context in this question is that of an audience coming to listen to a person speaking every week.

On a frigid Sunday Night game, these Seahawks were able to accomplish what few of their predecessors managed - to come out of Denver with a win. Carrying on their recent troubling tendency of weak first half performances, the Seahawks fell behind 13-7 to the Broncos, who were led by first-time starter Jay Cutler. The Seahawks managed only 2 first downs and 67 yards of total offense in the first half, but remained in the game thanks to Darryl Tapp's 25-yard return of an intercepted Cutler pass for a TD. In the second half, the teams traded punts and one turnover apiece until Seattle got the ball on its own 39-yard line with 9:42 left in the game. Two long pass completions from Matt Hasselbeck to Darrell Jackson put the Seahawks on the Broncos one-yard line. Shaun Alexander quickly took the ball into the endzone for a 14-13 Seahawks lead. The Broncos fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Joe Tafoya recovered. Assisted by a holding penalty on third down, the Seahawks moved the ball into range for Josh Brown to kick a 44-yard field goal. The Broncos held onto the following kickoff, but on their first play Cutler threw an interception to Jordan Babineaux for Seattle's  9th takeaway in the past two games. The Seahawks again had to settle for a Brown 23-yard field goal for a 20-13 lead with 3:01 remaining, keeping Denver in the game. The failure to score a TD proved costly, as Cutler connected with WR Brandon Marshall on a 71-yard pass and run play for a game tying TD, assisted by some poor tackling by Seattle. The Seahawks started the last drive at their own 14-yard line with 2:31 remaining. A key third down reception by Nate Burleson kept the drive alive, and Hasselbeck led the team down to the Broncos 32-yard line with 10 seconds remaining. Josh Brown came on to kick a game-winning, 50-yard FG, his fourth such kick of the season to tie an NFL record. With the win the Seahawks' lead in the NFC West increased to three games over the 49ers and Rams as they improved to 8-4.\\nHow many defensive touchdowns were scored in the first half?","target":"1","rationale":"To find how many defensive touchdowns were scored in the first half, we should check how many of them occurred before halftime.

Recent attempts to retain this simplicity while alleviating the gradient problem are based on proper initialization schemes or orthogonality/unitary constraints on the RNN’s recurrency matrix, which, however, comes with limitations to its expressive power with regards to dynamical systems phenomena like chaos or multi-stability. Here, we instead suggest a regularization scheme that pushes part of the RNN’s latent subspace toward a line attractor configuration that enables long short-term memory and arbitrarily slow time scales. We show that our approach excels on a number of benchmarks like the sequential MNIST or multiplication problems, and enables reconstruction of dynamical systems which harbor widely different time scales.","target":"We develop a new optimization approach for vanilla ReLU-based RNN that enables long short-term memory and identification of arbitrary nonlinear dynamical systems with widely differing time scales","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe develop a new optimization approach for vanilla ReLU-based RNN that enables long short-term memory and identification of arbitrary nonlinear dynamical systems with widely differing time scales."},{"source":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article:\\n\\nSteven Van Zandt (born November 22, 1950) is an American musician and actor, who frequently goes by the stage names Little Steven or Miami Steve.

He is also known for his roles on television dramas such as Silvio Dante on The Sopranos (1999-2007) and Frank Tagliano / Giovanni \\"Johnny\\" Henriksen on Lilyhammer (2012-2014). Van Zandt also has had his own solo band called Little Steven and The Disciples of Soul, active on and off since the 1980s.\\n\\nVan Zandt became a songwriter and producer for fellow Jersey shore act Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes in 1974, penning their signature song \\"I Don't Want to Go Home\\", co-writing other songs for them with Springsteen, and producing their most-acclaimed record, Hearts of Stone. As such, Van Zandt became a key contributor to the Jersey Shore sound. He also produced two Gary U.S. Bonds' albums. Van Zandt then went on to share production credits on the classic Springsteen albums The River and Born in the U.S.A. The first Springsteen song he co-produced was \\"Hungry Heart.\\" In 1989, Jackson Browne covered the 1983 Van Zandt composition \\"I Am A Patriot\\" on his World in Motion album. Van Zandt has produced a number of other records, including an uncredited effort on the Iron City Houserockers' Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive). Less successful was his work on Lone Justice's second album Shelter, which was a career-ending flop for the Los Angeles cowpunk band.  In 1989, Van Zandt wrote \\"While You Were Looking at Me\\" for Michael Monroe's album Not Fakin' It and co-wrote videohits \\"Dead, Jail or Rock'n Roll\\" and \\"Smoke Screen\\". He was an arranger and backing vocalist for a few songs on the album. In 1992, he produced Austin TX-based Arc Angels' debut album. In 1991 Van Zandt produced a successful album, Spirit of Love, for Nigerian superstar and raggae icon, Majek Fashek. In 1993, Van Zandt wrote and produced \\"All Alone on Christmas\\" for the soundtrack of the Chris Columbus film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, which yielded singer Darlene Love her first hit since \\"A Fine, Fine Boy\\" from 1963, thirty-one years earlier.  In 1994, Van Zandt produced the eponymous debut album of the punk rock band Demolition 23 which featured ex-Hanoi Rocks members Michael Monroe and Sami Yaffa. Van Zandt also co-wrote six songs for the album with Monroe and Jude Wilder. In 1995, Van Zandt aided Meat Loaf with the song \\"Amnesty Is Granted\\" off of his Welcome to the Neighborhood album.

I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next.\\nMurray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors.\\nShe set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like?\\nStarting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.\\nQuestion: Why did Juliette start the program\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. not enough information\\n\\nB.

Students in her area were not applying to study theatre","target":"C","rationale":"The context explains that Juliette wanted to encourage students from her local area who were not applying for medical school, potentially because they had a limited understanding of medicine and the work involved. So she began offering opportunities for them to gain real experience working in hospital settings.\\nJuliette's goal is stated as getting more people interested in studying medicine: \\"persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors.\\" This suggests option C or D are most likely correct answers. Option A doesn't provide an answer at all, while B seems less likely based on what we already know about Juliette's goals with this program."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- John Cameron Fogerty (born May 28, 1945) is an American musician, singer and songwriter, early in his career best known as the lead singer, lead guitarist and principal songwriter for the band Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) and later as a successful solo recording artist.

The name \\"bayou\\" can also refer to a creek whose current reverses daily due to tides and which contains brackish water highly conducive to fish life and plankton. Bayous are commonly found in the Gulf Coast region of the southern United States, notably the Mississippi River Delta, with the states of Louisiana and Texas being famous for them. A bayou is frequently an anabranch or minor braid of a braided channel that is moving much more slowly than the mainstem, often becoming boggy and stagnant. Though fauna varies by region, many bayous are home to crawfish, certain species of shrimp, other shellfish, catfish, frogs, toads, American alligators, American crocodiles, herons, turtles, spoonbills, snakes, leeches, and a myriad of other species.\\nEtymology.\\nThe word was first used by the English in Louisiana and is thought to originate from the Choctaw word \\"bayuk\\", which means \\"small stream\\". The first settlements of Bayou Teche, and other bayous, were by the Creoles, and that is why bayous are associated with Creole culture.\\n\\n- The United States Congress is the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States consisting of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Congress meets in the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a gubernatorial appointment. Members are usually affiliated to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party, and only rarely to a third party or as independents. Congress has 535 voting members: 435 Representatives and 100 Senators. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members in addition to its 435 voting members.

It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way inspired hard rock, Southern rock, and heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists.\\n\\n- Roots rock is rock music that looks back to rock's origins in folk, blues and country music. It is particularly associated with the creation of hybrid subgenres from the later 1960s including country rock and Southern rock, which have been seen as responses to the perceived excesses of dominant psychedelic and developing progressive rock. Because \\"roots music\\" (Americana) is often used to mean folk and world musical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any rock music that incorporates elements of this music. In the 1980s, roots rock enjoyed a revival in response to trends in punk rock, new wave and heavy metal music.\\n\\n- Jann Simon Wenner (born January 7, 1946) is the co-founder and publisher of the popular culture biweekly magazine \\"Rolling Stone\\", as well as the current owner of \\"Men's Journal\\" and \\"Us Weekly\\" magazines.

He dropped out, but while at Berkeley he participated in the Free Speech Movement. Wenner, with his mentor Ralph J. Gleason, co-founded Rolling Stone in 1967 with the help of a loan from family members and his soon to be wife. Later in his career, several musicians would allege that Wenner was unfairly biased against their work, thus hindering their induction into the Hall of Fame. Wenner received the Norman Mailer Prize in 2010 for his work in the publishing industry.\\n\\n- \\"Down on the Corner\\" is a song by the American band Creedence Clearwater Revival.

There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause hearing loss and brain disorders in children and, in severe cases, can kill. Vaccination coverage needs to be around 95 percent to prevent the virus circulating in communities - so-called “herd immunity”. In many countries, anti-vaccine campaigners seek to dissuade parents from getting their children immunized, despite strong scientific evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. In Italy, the co-ruling anti-establishment Five Star Movement has questioned the safety of some vaccines and loudly denounced efforts to make vaccinations mandatory. In the WHO’s European region, which covers nearly 900 million people, some 82,600 in 47 countries contracted measles last year - the highest number this decade. Of those, 72 cases were fatal. Six of the 53 countries did not report. In 34 of the countries, estimated coverage with a second dose of measles vaccine was below 95 percent. “(Immunization) gaps at local level still offer an open door to the virus,” the WHO’s European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said in a statement. Professor Arne Akbar, president of the British Society for Immunology, said the figures were “extremely concerning”. Heidi Larson, a specialist in vaccines and public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the increase in cases was a “wake-up call on the importance of building confidence in vaccination”. A report published by the European Commission last year and compiled by a team led by Larson found that measles immunization coverage has fallen in 12 EU countries since 2010, and that seven out of the 10 countries with the lowest vaccine confidence in the world are in Europe.

In particular, Paragraph 6 mentions anti-vaccination campaigners who dissuade parents from immunizing their children.

The paragraph corroborates with this claim as it also suggests that declining vaccination rates could be responsible for the rise in measles cases. Moreover, there is no evidence provided by the text which contradicts this claim i.e., there is no indication given by any other source (such as doctors or scientists) stating any other reason for the increase in measles cases apart from declining vaccination rates (or even suggesting anything which might suggest otherwise).

The US government even requires milk as part of the National School Lunch Program, saying that students should drink one cup of fat-free or low-fat milk every meal.\\nHowever, a group of doctors asked the government to take it away from the lunch program. The US 'Physician Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) says, \\"Milk is high in sugar, fat and animal protein,\\" all of which have negative effects on health. The PCRM says there are better and healthier ways to get calcium such as eating beans, broccoli, cereals and tofu. Orange juice and soymilk that have calcium added to them also supply the nutrient. \\"One of the only reasons people prefer milk is that it is going to help build strong bones,\\" says Dr Neal Barnard, president of the PCRM.

Passage 1:In 1991, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further in an already tense SFR Yugoslavia. The Serb politicians left the Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become part of the unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina, which had the intention on achieving independence from Croatia. As tensions rose, Croatia declared independence in June 1991. However, the declaration was suspended for three months, until 8 October 1991. The suspension came about as the European Economic Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe urged Croatia that it would not be recognized as an independent state because of the possibility of a civil war in Yugoslavia. The tensions escalated into the Croatian War of Independence when the Yugoslav People's Army and various Serb paramilitaries mobilized inside Croatia. On 3 October, the Yugoslav Navy renewed its blockade of the main ports of Croatia. This move followed months of standoff and the capture of Yugoslav military installations in Dalmatia and elsewhere. These events are now known as the Battle of the barracks. That resulted in the capture of significant quantities of weapons, ammunition and other equipment by the Croatian Army, including 150 armoured personnel carriers, 220 tanks and 400 artillery pieces of caliber or larger, 39 barracks and 26 other facilities including two signals centres and a missile base. It also coincided with the end of Operation Coast-91, in which the Yugoslav forces failed to occupy the coastline in an attempt to cut off Dalmatia's access to the rest of Croatia.\\n Passage 2:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.\\n Passage 3:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences.

DP is a system for sharing information about a dataset publicly by describing groups' patterns within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset. DP can be achieved if the we are willing to add random noise to the result. For example, rather than simply reporting the sum, we can inject noise from a Laplace or gaussian distribution, producing a result that’s not quite exact, that masks the contents of any given row.  It intuitively requires that the mechanism that outputs information about an underlying dataset is robust to one sample's any change, thus protecting privacy. A mechanism \${f}$ is a random function that takes a dataset $\\\\mathcal {N}$ as input, and outputs a random variable \${f}(\\\\mathcal {N})$. For example, suppose $\\\\mathcal {N}$ is a news articles dataset, then the function that outputs compound score of articles in $\\\\mathcal {N}$ plus noise from the standard normal distribution is a mechanism [7].","target":"How does the differential privacy mechanism work?","rationale":"The best question should be \\"How does the differential privacy mechanism work?\\", which requires an answer that explains the framework of differential privacy: injecting random noise to avoid masking individual records."},{"source":"Read the following context and choose the best option to answer the question.\\nContext: He 'd have died naturally from it , but they did n't want him to sit around in pain for the last day or two of his life .

Afterwards, the Bills ended the half as Lindell kicked a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Bills drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, along with a 33-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got into position to kick a 51-yard field goal. They got the kick, but Head Coach Joe Gibbs called timeout. When the Bills tried to kick again, Gibbs called timeout again, but unintentionally got his team an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty which not only moved the Bills 15 yards closer to their end zone but reduced Lindell's field goal attempt to 36 yards.

The genus is usually placed in the birch family Betulaceae, though some botanists split the hazels (with the hornbeams and allied genera) into a separate family Corylaceae. The fruit of the hazel is the hazelnut.\\n\\n- Hornbeams are hardwood trees in the flowering plant genus \\"Carpinus\\" in the birch family Betulaceae. The 3040 species occur across much of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.\\n\\n- Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\"\\n\\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).\\n\\n- The birch family, the Betulaceae, includes six genera of deciduous nut-bearing trees and shrubs, including the birches, alders, hazels, hornbeams, hazel-hornbeam, and hop-hornbeams numbering a total of 167 species. They are mostly natives of the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species reaching the Southern Hemisphere in the Andes in South America. Their typical flowers are catkins and often appear before leaves.\\n\\n- Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.\\n\\n- BIRCH (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an unsupervised data mining algorithm used to perform hierarchical clustering over particularly large data-sets. An advantage of BIRCH is its ability to incrementally and dynamically cluster incoming, multi-dimensional metric data points in an attempt to produce the best quality clustering for a given set of resources (memory and time constraints). In most cases, BIRCH only requires a single scan of the database.\\n\\n- Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of .\\n\\n- In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.\\n\\n- Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\\n\\n- A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.\\n\\n- Alder is the common name of a genus of flowering plants (Alnus) belonging to the birch family Betulaceae. The genus comprises about 35 species of monoecious trees and shrubs, a few reaching a large size, distributed throughout the north temperate zone with a few species extending into Central America, as well as the northern and southern Andes.\\n\\n- Betula raddeana is a species of plant in the Betulaceae family . It is found in Georgia and Russia .

The defining feature that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea) is that they have membrane-bound organelles, especially the nucleus, which contains the genetic material and is enclosed by the nuclear envelope. The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name, which comes from the Greek  (\\"eu\\", \\"well\\" or \\"true\\") and  (\\"karyon\\", \\"nut\\" or \\"kernel\\"). Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. In addition, plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Eukaryotic organisms may be unicellular or multicellular. Only eukaryotes form multicellular organisms consisting of many kinds of tissue made up of different cell types.\\n\\n- Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area.

European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia.\\n\\n- The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America.

The defendants aided in defrauding two funds managed by the Claims Conference, the Article 2 Fund and the Hardship Fund, of $45 million and $12.3 million, respectively, according to court documents. The Article 2 Fund makes monthly payments of around $400 to survivors of Nazi persecution who make less than $16,000 per year \\"and either lived in hiding or under a false identity for at least 18 months,\\" according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's office.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements.

Following his famous predecessor Saint Ambrose of Milan, he named Mary as the Mother of the Church during the Second Vatican Council. Paul VI sought dialogue with the world, with other Christians, other religions, and atheists, excluding nobody. He saw himself as a humble servant for a suffering humanity and demanded significant changes of the rich in North America and Europe in favour of the poor in the Third World. His positions on birth control, promulgated most famously in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae, and other political issues, were often controversial, especially in Western Europe and North America. Answer: What did Pope Paul VI re-convene when he became Pope?","target":"the Second Vatican Council","rationale":"The context states that Pope Paul VI was the first to take the name \\"Paul\\" since 1605. This is likely a reference to Saint Paul, who is known for spreading Christianity across Europe and Asia Minor. Thus, it can be inferred from this statement that one of his goals as pope would have been to spread Catholicism or perform missionary work in other countries.\\nUpon taking office, he re-convened an event called the Second Vatican Council; such councils are held every few decades by Catholic leaders to discuss problems within their faith and establish policies accordingly. Given its timing shortly after Montini became pope and his stated interest in missionary work, we can infer that it must have had some sort of relationship with these issues."},{"source":"Read the given text and if it has abusive content then indicate via \\"yes\\".

Passage:Pratt gave much of his time and wealth to Baltimore’s cultural and charitable institutions. He served as a trustee of the Peabody Institute, founded in 1857, which began construction in 1860 and opened/dedicated in 1866, in the presence of its benefactor, fellow Bay Stater and friend, George Peabody, (1795-1869), who also formerly made his original fortune in \\"The Monumental City\\" during the 20 years of his first business, 1815-1835, at the time was the wealthiest man in the Americas. The new Institute's various cultural programs that were to be established of an art gallery, reference library, series of educational lectures, a music conservatory, and system of scholarship honors (engrossed certificates and monetary prizes with gold or silver medals) for honored graduates of the city's new public high schools (\\"Peabody Prizes\\"), which were continued for 130 years. A decade later, nine years after his death, the east wing of the Institute with its noted gallery of cast-iron balconies for the book stacks, ceiling skylight and impressive architecture by Edmund G. Lind for its scholarly, non-circulating reference library, (now known as The George Peabody Library) was completed in 1878, and was one of the reasons that the first President Daniel Coit Gilman of the new Johns Hopkins University opening in February 1876, temporarily located its first campus a few blocks away on North Howard Street, rather than at Hopkins' summer/country estate of \\"Clifton\\" in northeast Baltimore. These acts of generous philanthropy further inspired Pratt, by his friend and fellow Massachusetts-born and Baltimore industrialist/financier George Peabody, [1795-1869], who earned his fortune beginning during his earlier twenty years in the city during 1815-1835 and his other friend and fellow merchant Johns Hopkins, (1795-1873). He founded the \\"House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children\\" which he offered on his former farm property at Cheltenham (in Prince George's County), and the Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb located at Frederick on South Market Street. In 1865, he donated a free school and public library (The Pratt Free School in 1856, and further endowed upon its 1865 incorporation - which later became a public grammar school preparing students for advancement to the local Middleborough High School, founded 1873), to his hometown of Middleborough in Massachusetts.","target":"a","rationale":"The passage mentions Daniel Coit Gilman, who held the position of the first President of Johns Hopkins University.

At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\\n\\n- The Bealey River is a small river located in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. It is a tributary of the Waimakariri River. Its valley forms the eastern approach to Arthur's Pass. The river and the Bealey settlement are named for Samuel Bealey, a 19th-century Superintendent of Canterbury Province and pastoralist.\\n\\n- The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.\\n\\n- Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.\\n\\n- Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.\\n\\n- Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island.

We analyzed the outcome of 46 consecutive patients with primary lung cancer on whom mechanical ventilators were utilized. Although seven patients were ultimately weaned and survived for at least 24 hours, three of them subsequently died prior to discharge from the hospital. The remaining 39 patients died while using the ventilator. Patient age, tumor cell type, and the etiology of respiratory failure were not significantly different between the weaned and unweaned populations. A difference was noted in the duration of mechanical ventilation: none of the patients who could be weaned required mechanical ventilation for more than six days (range, two to six days).

This poses a critical challenge to machine learning security, and impedes the wide application of machine learning in many important domains such as computer vision and malware detection.   Unfortunately, even state-of-the-art defense approaches such as adversarial training and defensive distillation still suffer from major limitations and can be circumvented.   From a unique angle, we propose to investigate two important research questions in this paper: Are adversarial examples distinguishable from natural examples?   Are adversarial examples generated by different methods distinguishable from each other?   These two questions concern the distinguishability of adversarial examples.   Answering them will potentially lead to a simple yet effective approach, termed as defensive distinction in this paper under the formulation of multi-label classification, for protecting against adversarial examples.   We design and perform experiments using the MNIST dataset to investigate these two questions, and obtain highly positive results demonstrating the strong distinguishability of adversarial examples.   We recommend that this unique defensive distinction approach should be seriously considered to complement other defense approaches.","target":"We propose a defensive distinction protection approach and demonstrate the strong distinguishability of adversarial examples","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose a defensive distinction protection approach and demonstrate the strong distinguishability of adversarial examples."},{"source":"In this task, you are given an input list.

The Giants were able to hold the Bucs to six three and outs in their first seven possessions.  On offense, Eli Manning and Tiki Barber were effective if not spectacular.  Near the end of the first quarter, the Giants started a 54-yard drive, culminating on a seven-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Plaxico Burress. Midway through the second quarter, the defense struck again as Cadillac Williams fumbled a pitch and tackle Fred Robbins recovered for New York at the Bucs' 28.  The Giants then used a deep pass to Burress and hard-nosed running to extend their lead to 14-0.  The touchdown was scored on a one yard plunge by Brandon Jacobs.  Tampa Bay had chances to get back into the game over the next 20 minutes, but several dropped passes and questionable fourth down plays doomed them.  Overall, rookie quarterback Bruce Gradkowski played well for Tampa Bay, but it wasn't enough.  The Giants clinched the win late in the fourth quarter with some power running from Jacobs and Barber.  Jay Feely added a 31-yard field goal to provide the final points in the 17-3 win.

Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies. Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage. Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal.

Passage:Piccaver was born on 5 February 1884 in the Lincolnshire town of Long Sutton to chemist Frederick Herman Piccaver (born 1864, died 17 February 1916) and his wife Sarah Ann Sissons. The Piccavers had been farm laborers, but there were also claims of Spanish ancestry dating back to the Spanish Armada. At a young age, Alfred emigrated with his family to the United States of America. The family resettled in Albany, NY and took American citizenship. Frederick Piccaver worked as head brewer of the Beverwyck Brewery. Alfred joined the choir of Albany's St. Peter's Episcopal Church as a boy soprano. He also became a soloist at the North Reformed Church in Watervliet. The young Piccaver went on to study voice with S. Graham Nobbes, who had been chief instructor of the Emma Willard Conservatory of Music and with Allan Lindsay, conductor of the Troy Conservatory of Music. Alfred later trained to be electrical engineer but he had a talent for singing and in 1905 he enrolled at the Metropolitan School of Opera.

He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.

After being stopped on their first possession, the Browns were forced to punt. Paul Ernster fumbled the snap, which resulted in a poor kick, and the Browns were called for four penalties on the play. The Steelers took possession on the Browns' 22-yard line and scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Ben Ben Roethlisberger to Hines Ward. On the Browns' next possession, Charlie Frye threw an interception to Deshea Townsend, which eventually led to the Steelers' second score of the game, a 26-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. The Brown next possession ended when Jamal Lewis fumbled the ball at the Browns' 40-yard line. The Steelers quickly converted the turnover, with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes on the next play to bring the score to 17-0. After being sacked five times and throwing for only 34&#160;yards on 4-of-10 passing, Frye was removed from the game and was replaced by second-string quarterback Derek Anderson. In the second quarter, Willie Parker fumbled the ball and gave the Browns possession. However, the team was forced to punt, and just two drives later, the Browns fumbled the ball again - this time on a sack by Ryan Clark of Anderson. The Browns were able to hold the Steelers scoreless through the second quarter as Roethlisberger failed to connect on his last six pass attempts of the quarter. However, the Steelers also held the Browns scoreless, and the teams entered halftime with the Steelers ahead 17-0. The second half began well for the Steelers, with an eight-play, 71-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie Matt Spaeth. The Browns countered with a long drive of 76&#160;yards that ended with a one-yard touchdown pass from Anderson to second-year fullback Lawrence Vickers, cutting the deficit to 24-7. However, this would be the Browns' only score of the game. On the next drive, the Steelers answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Heath Miller, giving the Steelers a 31-7 advantage. The Browns punted on their next possession, and the Steelers capped an eight-minute drive with a 31-yard field goal by Reed, giving the Steelers a 34-7 lead, which they never surrendered. On the Browns' next offensive possession, Braylon Edwards dropped a pass from Anderson, which was ruled a fumble. Following a Steelers punt, Anderson threw an interception to Ike Taylor on a pass intended for Edwards, and Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch ran the clock out, securing the win. The loss put the Browns record at 0-1, and allowed the Steelers to take a one-game lead in the overall series, 56 wins to 55. Following the game, head coach Romeo Crennel stated that he didn't know who would start at quarterback in the next game versus the Cincinnati Bengals. He also stood by his decision not to insert rookie Brady Quinn into the game, even after chants were heard from the home crowd hoping otherwise.

The Browns are the first team since 1970 to trade their starting quarterback before Week 2.

Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.

Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar.

It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.\\n\\nand the situation: The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not.\\n\\nAnswer the following question: Which city will need to inspect their dams more often?","target":"Reslie","rationale":"Soil piping occurs when there is a rapid salination of the soil. Soil that experiences this sort of damage will lose its structural integrity, and thus be subject to more erosion as well as dam failure should one exist in proximity. Because Reslie has experienced soil piping while Tichago hasn't (yet), Reslie's dams are at greater risk of failing due to increased levels of erosion. Therefore, Reslie would need to inspect their dams much more often than Tichago does."},{"source":"What is the answer for the question: Who does the paraplegic girl fall in love with? from the following article ?\\n\\nThe story takes place entirely in New York.

Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents the high level of interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had spent a good deal of time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, as well as that of Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.","target":"Charlotte","rationale":"The answer to the question is Charlotte.\\nWhy?

The clash of metal rang through the forest. An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge.

They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart.

He was a member of the prominent Abashidze family. The youngest son of Prince Paata Abashidze, he was served as a priest until about 1684 when he entered politics after the death of his elder brother Paata Abashidze and began aggressively expanding his patrimonial fiefdom. He dispossessed the Chkheidze family of Shorapani, and the Agiashvili of Tsutskhvati, and took control of the royal domain in Upper Imereti. His daughter, Tamar, was married to the two successive kings of Imereti, Alexander IV and George V. During the reign of the latter monarch, Abashidze effectively ran the government and acted as an all-powerful kingmaker. In 1699, he gave his daughter Anika in marriage to King Simon of Imereti, but they divorced in 1700. In 1701, Abashidze compelled King Mamia of Imereti to abdicate and seized the throne for himself. He managed to establish a degree of stability in Imereti and ceased to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire, triggering a military response in 1703. He also patronized culture and learning. Deposed after a revolt by the nobles, in favour of the rightful Bagrationi king George VII, Abashidze took refuge at the court of Vakhtang VI of Kartli in Tbilisi.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato's lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \\"Island of Timber. \\" The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \\n\\nQuestion: Why might a Castillian source have known about the existence of Madeira around the time Zarco was exploring?\\nI think \\"The Canary Islands, which: were 445 km (275 miles) to the south of Madiera, had occupied busy shipping lanes for nearly a century\\" is a valid answer.

There are several subcategories, dominantly focusing on rock, pop, or urban music. Used alone, \\"CHR\\" most often refers to the CHR-pop format.

Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.\\n\\n- Teen pop is a subgenre of pop music that is created, marketed and oriented towards preteens and teenagers. Teen pop copies genres and styles such as pop, R&B, dance, electronic, hip hop, country and rock.\\nTypical characteristics of teen pop music include auto-tuned vocals, choreographed dancing, emphasis on visual appeal (photogenic faces, unique body physiques, immaculately attended hair and designer clothes), lyrics focused on teenage issues such as love/relationships, finding yourself, friendships, coming of age, fitting in and growing up (regardless of the artists' age) and repeated chorus lines.\\n\\n- Bubblegum pop (also known as bubblegum music or simply bubblegum) is a genre of pop music with an upbeat sound contrived and marketed to appeal to pre-teens and teenagers, that may be produced in an assembly-line process, driven by producers and often using unknown singers. Bubblegum's classic period ran from 1967 to 1972.
