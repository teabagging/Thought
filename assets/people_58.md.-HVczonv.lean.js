If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\\n\\nI was so upset by my landlady!

Instead of calling me first she just made a knee jerk decision and called to have my car towed. I had to incur the expenses of the impound yard. To recover these costs I have decided to sue my landlady. There was no reason for her to go to that extreme and I am certain I will recover the costs.

A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \\"distributive efficiency\\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\\"the additional dollar\\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies[2][32] have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.\\n\\nParagraph: Finland has one of the lowest economic inequality in the world.

Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Two lands applied different economical measures over the last decade.

He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world.

If the blood is too different from your own, the transfusion could kill you.\\nThere are four basic types of blood; A, B, AB, and O. A simple test can make sure of a person's blood type. Everybody is born with one of these four types of blood. Blood type, like hair color1 and height, is received from parents.\\nThe four groups must be transfused carefully. A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. O can give to any other group; therefore, it is often called the universal donor  . For the opposite reason, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient . However, because so many reactions   can happen in transfusions , patients usually receive only salt of plasma (liquid part of blood) until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible in the blood bank of a hospital. In this way, it is possible to prevent the transfusion from any bad reactions.\\nQuestion: Which of the following statement is NOT true?\\nAnswer:","target":"AB is the mixture of A and B","rationale":"The article explains that there are four types of blood, A, B, AB and O. Blood type is determined by the proteins on red cells in a person's blood. There are two main proteins: antigens A and B. People with Type A have antigen A on their red cells; those with Type B have antigen B (but not antibody); people with both antigens have Type AB; and those who neither one or other protein present in their blood have Type O. Therefore the statement \\"AB is the mixture of A and B\\" does NOT refer to how this blood type occurs naturally but rather describes it as if mixed from different types of blood for transfusion purposes which can be dangerous since patients need compatible donors for safe transfusions according to medical guidelines explained after this statement in"},{"source":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens with a woman walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street.

The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these associations by sharing data from many studies.   \\n METHODS Collaborative analyses were undertaken of baseline BMI versus mortality in 57 prospective studies with 894 576 participants, mostly in western Europe and North America (61% [n=541 452] male, mean recruitment age 46 [SD 11] years, median recruitment year 1979 [IQR 1975-85], mean BMI 25 [SD 4] kg/m(2)). The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study. To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded, leaving 66 552 deaths of known cause during a mean of 8 (SD 6) further years of follow-up (mean age at death 67 [SD 10] years): 30 416 vascular; 2070 diabetic, renal or hepatic; 22 592 neoplastic; 3770 respiratory; 7704 other.   \\n FINDINGS In both sexes, mortality was lowest at about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). Above this range, positive associations were recorded for several specific causes and inverse associations for none, the absolute excess risks for higher BMI and smoking were roughly additive, and each 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was on average associated with about 30% higher overall mortality (hazard ratio per 5 kg/m(2) [HR] 1.29 [95% CI 1.27-1.32]): 40% for vascular mortality (HR 1.41 [1.37-1.45]); 60-120% for diabetic, renal, and hepatic mortality (HRs 2.16 [1.89-2.46], 1.59 [1.27-1.99], and 1.82 [1.59-2.09], respectively); 10% for neoplastic mortality (HR 1.10 [1.06-1.15]); and 20% for respiratory and for all other mortality (HRs 1.20 [1.07-1.34] and 1.20 [1.16-1.25], respectively). Below the range 22.5-25 kg/m(2), BMI was associated inversely with overall mortality, mainly because of strong inverse associations with respiratory disease and lung cancer. These inverse associations were much stronger for smokers than for non-smokers, despite cigarette consumption per smoker varying little with BMI.   \\n INTERPRETATION Although other anthropometric measures (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) could well add extra information to BMI, and BMI to them, BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular disease and is probably largely causal. At 30-35 kg/m(2), median survival is reduced by 2-4 years; at 40-45 kg/m(2), it is reduced by 8-10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking). The definite excess mortality below 22.5 kg/m(2) is due mainly to smoking-related diseases, and is not fully explained.","target":"True","rationale":"This abstract includes a topic sentence that states the main purpose of the study (\\"The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these associations by sharing data from many studies\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

With an NFL-record regular season crowd on hand, Dallas would play a Sunday night game against their NFC East rival, the New York Giants. In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early as Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes got a 30-yard field goal.  Dallas responded with running back Marion Barber getting a 2-yard touchdown run, but New York retook the lead as cornerback Bruce Johnson returned an interception 34 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, the Giants added a Tynes 28-yard field goal to make the score 13-7.  The Cowboys responded with a 1-yard Tony Romo touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, yet New York went back on top as quarterback Eli Manning completed a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mario Manningham, this pass however was juggled but still ruled as a touchdown.  Dallas closed out the half as kicker Nick Folk made a 47-yard field goal. The Cowboys would regain the lead in the third quarter as Romo ran for a 3-yard touchdown.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Giants again got the lead as Manning completed a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Smith, followed by Tynes kicking a 36-yard field goal. Dallas responded with a 7-yard touchdown run from running back Felix Jones.

How many more touchdown runs were there than touchdown passes?","target":"1","rationale":"The passage says \\"Dallas responded with running back Marion Barber getting a 2-yard touchdown run\\" and \\"Dallas closed out the half as kicker Nick Folk made a 47-yard field goal\\". Thus, there are two touchdowns runs. The article also mentions that Romo completed three touchdown passes to Jason Witten (1 yard), Mario Manningham(22 yards) and Steve Smith (22 yards).

You have to classify the questions into \\"Extractive\\", \\"Abstractive\\", or \\"Yes-no\\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from a context into a summary while answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. Yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. Typically, the choices are either yes or no.\\n\\nComparing Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 with Eq.DISPLAY_FORM22, we can see that Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 is actually a soft form of $F1$, using a continuous $p$ rather than the binary $\\\\mathbb {I}( p_{i1}>0.5)$. This gap isn't a big issue for balanced datasets, but is extremely detrimental if a big proportion of training examples are easy-negative ones: easy-negative examples can easily dominate training since their probabilities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hard-negative examples and positive ones, which has a huge negative effect on the final F1 performance.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we propose to multiply the soft probability $p$ with a decaying factor $(1-p)$, changing Eq.DISPLAY_FORM22 to the following form:\\n\\nOne can think $(1-p_{i1})$ as a weight associated with each example, which changes as training proceeds. The intuition of changing $p_{i1}$ to $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ is to push down the weight of easy examples. For easy examples whose probability are approaching 0 or 1, $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ makes the model attach significantly less focus to them. Figure FIGREF23 gives gives an explanation from the perspective in derivative: the derivative of $\\\\frac{(1-p)p}{1+(1-p)p}$ with respect to $p$ approaches 0 immediately after $p$ approaches 0, which means the model attends less to examples once they are correctly classified.\\n\\nA close look at Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 reveals that it actually mimics the idea of focal loss (FL for short) BIBREF16 for object detection in vision. Focal loss was proposed for one-stage object detector to handle foreground-background tradeoff encountered during training. It down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples by adding a $(1-p)^{\\\\beta }$ factor, leading the final loss to be $(1-p)^{\\\\beta }\\\\log p$. \\n Question: How are weights dynamically adjusted?","target":"Extractive","rationale":"The question can be answered by extracting the following sentence from the passage: \\"easy examples can easily dominate training since their probabilities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily\\".

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster.

The individual scutes as shown above have specific names and are generally consistent across the various species of turtles. Terrestrial tortoises do not shed their scutes. New scutes grow by the addition of keratin layers to the base of each scute. Aquatic chelonii shed individual scutes. The scute effectively forms the skin over the underlying bony structures; there is a very thin layer of subcutaneous tissue between the scute and the skeleton. The scutes can be brightly colored in some species, but the basal color is a grey to dark brown color dorsally; the plastral scutes are often white to yellow in base color. A turtle's shell consists of three rows of scutes, numbering 4, 9, and 25 from the inside out. These are the squares of the first three prime numbers, viz. 2, 3, and 5.

Passage:Fram Reykjavík won the second-tier championship of 1. deild karla in 2006 and finished 7th in the Landsbankadeild (the then name for the premier division) in 2007. They bought the Swedish striker Patrik Redo, whom they later had to sell to Keflavík Football Club. In 2008 Fram played their best season in many years when they finished 3rd in the Landsbankadeild. In 2009 the club was number 4, and played in the Icelandic Cup Final but lost to Breiðablik UBK in a penalty shootout. Now it seems as if Fram Reykjavík is back among the best again. Fram's woes continued in the spring of 2006. In 2008 things changed a lot though a new manager came that had been playing for Fram Reykjavík in the famous 86–91 team Þorvaldur Örlygsson. He started by buying Auðun Helgason, a former Icelandic international football player Assistant manager. For the third time in three years, a new coach would take the helm and most of the time it seemed as if nobody could lead Fram Reykjavík out of the dark. This time, however, it was a complete success. Fram Reykjavík won four straight games, gobbling up KR's lead as team number 3 in the table (a qualifying position for the UEFA Cup), and finally overtaking them. Fram Reykjavík against FH Hafnarfjörður where they won away which was for the first time in many years, the team that was supposed to be unbeatable they managed to win. The following weekend, Fram Reykjavík beat Keflavík, securing the club's third position in the league for the first time since 1992. Fram Reykjavík was back in European competition: the team that almost drew at Nou Camp 18 years ago was back, and there was more good news to come, Þorvaldur Örlygsson accepted a new offer to be the manager. The summer of 2009 came out to be not as good as expected in Úrvalsdeild Fram Reykjavík finished 4th, which was an obvious disappointment. And in Visa-Bikar 2009 Fram Reykjavík made it to the finals but lost in penalty kickout against Breiðablik UBK where Paul McShane missed the last penally for Fram Reykjavík, in UEFA Cup 2009 Fram won The New Saints F.C. easily in the first round but in the second round Fram Reykjavík traveled to Czech Republic to play Sigma Olomouc the first match went 1–1 where Sigma scored a goal almost in the last second of the match. The second match Sigma Olomouc won but Fram Reykjavík was told to have played maybe their best matches of the summer there and they showed that on a good day they could play like the big teams in Europe. Before the 2009 season Þorvaldur Örlygsson brought several new players to Fram Reykjavík, one of them being Jón Gunnar Eysteinsson who Þorvaldur Örlygsson knew well from Fjarðabyggð, he was supposed to come instead of Auðun Helgason that went to Grindavík and Some other players like the English brothers which both started their career playing for Chelsea F.C., Joe Tillen and Sam Tillen the team of 2010 was one of the youngest teams ever in Icelandic football, the oldest player was 25 years old.

Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream...\\n\\nParagraph: Bobby and Sally are siblings that currently live in different cities. Bobby lives in a city that has wildfires on a regular basis.

Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg.

Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. \\n\\n- Frank Conrad (May 4, 1874  December 10, 1941) was an electrical engineer, best known for radio development, including his work as a pioneer broadcaster. He worked for the Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for half a century. His experimental radio station provided the inspiration, and he acted in an advisory role, for the establishment of Westinghouse's first broadcasting service, over radio station KDKA.\\n\\n- In electronics, a vacuum tube, an electron tube, or just a tube (North America), or valve (Britain and some other regions), is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container.\\nVacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.\\n\\n- Analog television (or analogue television) is the original television technology that uses analog signals to transmit video and audio. In an analog television broadcast, the brightness, colors and sound are represented by rapid variations of either the amplitude, frequency or phase of the signal.\\n\\n- The digital television transition , also called the digital switchover or analog switch - off ( ASO ) , is the process in which analog television broadcasting is converted to and replaced by digital television . This primarily involves the conversion of analog terrestrial television to digital terrestrial . However , it also involves analog cable conversion to digital cable , as well as analog to digital satellite . In many countries , a simulcast service is operated where a broadcast is made available to viewers in both analog and digital at the same time . As digital becomes more popular , it is likely that the existing analog services will be removed . In some cases this has already happened , where a broadcaster has offered incentives to viewers to encourage them to switch to digital . In other cases government policies have been introduced to encourage or force the switchover process , especially with regard to terrestrial broadcasts . Government intervention usually involves providing some funding for broadcasters and , in some cases monetary relief to viewers , to enable a switchover to happen by a given deadline . The switchover for individual countries varies ; in some countries it is being implemented in stages as in India and the United Kingdom , where each region has a separate date to switch off . In others , the whole country switches on one date , such as the Netherlands , which switched off all analog services on 11 December 2006 . Some countries have different switch off dates for each channel , such as China where CCTV channels 1 - 5 were switched off first .\\n\\n- The electromagnetic spectrum is the collective term for all known frequencies and their linked wavelengths of the known photons (electromagnetic radiation). The \\"electromagnetic spectrum\\" \\"of an object\\" has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object.\\n\\n- Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or, in the 2010s, light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.\\nAnalog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation.\\n\\n- Motorola, Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications company based in Schaumburg, Illinois, United States. After having lost $4.3 billion from 2007 to 2009, the company was divided into two independent public companies, Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions on January 4, 2011. Motorola Solutions is generally considered to be the direct successor to Motorola, Inc., as the reorganization was structured with Motorola Mobility being spun off. Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo in 2014.\\n\\n- Color television is a television transmission technology that includes information on the color of the picture, so the video image can be displayed in color on the television set. It is an improvement on the earliest television technology, monochrome or black and white television, in which the image is displayed in shades of grey (greyscale). Television broadcasting stations and networks in most parts of the world upgraded from black and white to color transmission in the 1960s and 1970s. The invention of color television standards is an important part of the history of television, and it is described in the technology of television article.\\n\\n- Arris Group is an American telecommunications equipment manufacturing company that provides cable operators with high-speed data, video and telephony systems for homes and businesses. The company is headquartered in Suwanee, Georgia, and has design, engineering, manufacturing, distribution, service and sales office locations throughout the world.\\nTwo of the company's popular home telephony modems are the TM402P and the TM502G. The firm also produces the SBG6580 wireless cable modem-and-router (residential gateway) unit, among other telecommunications and data-transfer products.\\n\\n- Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.\\n\\n- In electronics and telecommunications a transmitter or radio transmitter is an electronic device which generates a radio frequency alternating current. When a connected antenna is excited by this alternating current, the antenna emits radio waves.\\n\\n- A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world.\\n\\n- Digital cable is any type of cable television distribution using digital video compression for USE. The technology was originally developed by General Instrument before being acquired by Motorola and subsequently acquired by ARRIS Group. Cable companies converted to digital systems during the 2000s, around the time that television signals were converted to the digital HDTV format, which was not compatible with earlier analog cable systems. In addition to providing higher resolution HD video, digital cable systems provide expanded services such as pay-per-view programming, cable internet access and cable telephone services. Most digital cable signals are encrypted, which reduced the high incidence of cable theft which occurred in analog systems. \\n\\n- General Instrument (GI) was an American electronics manufacturer based in Horsham, Pennsylvania specializing in semiconductors and cable television equipment. The company was active until 1997, when it split into General Semiconductor (power semiconductors, which was later acquired by Vishay Intertechnology in November 2001), CommScope and NextLevel Systems.\\n\\n- A telephone, or phone, is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals suitable for transmission via cables or other transmission media over long distances, and replays such signals simultaneously in audible form to its user.\\n\\n- An analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., \\"analogous\\" to another time varying signal. For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves. It differs from a digital signal, in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of a finite number of values. The term analog signal usually refers to electrical signals; however, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals.\\nAn analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information. In an electrical signal, the voltage, current, or frequency of the signal may be varied to represent the information.\\nAny information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as sound, light, temperature, position, or pressure. The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a transducer. For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in air pressure (that is to say, sound) strike the diaphragm of a microphone which induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone, or the voltage produced by a condenser microphone. The voltage or the current is said to be an \\"analog\\" of the sound.\\nAn analog signal has a theoretically infinite resolution. In practice an analog signal is subject to electronic noise and distortion introduced by communication channels and signal processing operations, which can progressively degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In contrast, digital signals have a finite resolution. Converting an analog signal to digital form introduces a constant low-level noise called...\\n\\n- Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.\\n\\n- Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners.\\n\\n- Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.\\n\\n- Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and display of moving visual media.\\n\\n- Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.\\n\\n- Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signal, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television. Digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth. It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s. Several regions of the world are in different stages of adaptation and are implementing different broadcasting standards. Below are the different widely used digital television broadcasting standards (DTB):\\n\\n- Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.\\n\\n- An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of insulated wire wound into a coil. A current through the wire creates a magnetic field which is concentrated in the hole in the center of the coil. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.\\n\\n- Pay-per-view (PPV) is a type of pay television service by which a subscriber of a television service provider can purchase events to view via private telecast. The broadcaster shows the event at the same time to everyone ordering it (as opposed to video-on-demand systems, which allow viewers to see recorded broadcasts at any time). Events can be purchased using an on-screen guide, an automated telephone system, or through a live customer service representative. Events often include feature films, sporting events, and other entertainment programs. With the rise of the Internet, the term Internet pay-per-view (iPPV) has been used to describe pay-per-view services accessed online. PPV is most commonly used to distribute combat sports events, such as boxing, mixed martial arts, and professional wrestling.\\n\\n- An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called \\"readers\\"), theatre, music (in which they are called \\"listeners\\"), video games (in which they are called \\"players\\"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception.\\n\\n\\n\\n'digital television transition' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'part of'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 2000s\\n - 2010s\\n - 20th century\\n - art\\n - back\\n - boxing\\n - broadcasting\\n - center\\n - communication\\n - communication technology\\n - company\\n - december\\n - design\\n - education\\n - electromagnetic radiation\\n - electromagnetic spectrum\\n - electronic\\n - electronics\\n - engineering\\n - equipment\\n - event\\n - evolution\\n - floor\\n - hand\\n - human\\n - internet\\n - martial arts\\n - mass\\n - may\\n - medium\\n - mixed martial arts\\n - music\\n - part\\n - participation\\n - production\\n - radiation\\n - station\\n - system\\n - technology\\n - telecommunication\\n - television programming\\n - the collection\\n - the wire\\n - work","target":"technology","rationale":"The digital television transition refers to the process of converting analog systems into a fully digitized system.

The Patriots marched deep into their own territory on the opening drive of the game, but were forced to punt. The Jets responded with an 11 play, 75-yard drive, aided by a defensive holding penalty on Ras-I Dowling giving the Jets a first down, and scoring on a Shonn Greene 1-yard touchdown run. Devin McCourty returned the ensuing kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots raced 58 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, taking a 14-7 lead. Two possessions later, Mark Sanchez fumbled the snap and kicked the ball out of the end zone for a safety, increasing the Patriots lead to 16-7 early in the second quarter. After a Patriots punt, the Jets drove to the Patriots 36, but Sanchez was intercepted by Dennard at the Patriots 2 for no gain. The Patriots drove to the Jets 45, but punted, as well. Starting at their own 5, the Jets raced to the Patriots 36, and Nick Folk nailed a 54-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 16-10 at halftime. Joe McKnight returned the kickoff 37 yards to the Jets 32. With the decent starting field position, the Jets drove 66 yards to the Patriots 3, but the Patriots defense stiffened and forced the Jets to settle for Folk's 21-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 16-13. The Patriots countered on their next drive, putting together a 15 play, 67-yard drive in just under six minutes, converting three third-downs, and scoring on a two-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 23-13. Two possessions later, the Jets engineered a 14 play, 91-yard drive, converting three third-downs, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Sanchez to Dustin Keller, trimming the deficit to 23-20.

His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include  Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann  played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it. Then, from the same drawer, she took a package done up in coarser paper, and opened it likewise, looked at it, smelt it, and touched it with the tip of her tongue very cautiously indeed. It was white, too, but coarser than the medicine. She was very careful in tasting it, and she immediately rinsed her mouth with water, before she tied up the package again, shut the drawer, and put the key into her pocket. \\nQuestion: What type of paper was the second medicine wrapped? \\nIs the correct answer Coarse paper?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The text indicates that the second package was wrapped in coarser paper. The passage also indicates that Matilde could read and write fairly well, but not sufficiently to understand her own doctor's handwriting or Latin abbreviations, thus it is unlikely she would have written a prescription for herself, which means Elettra likely carried back only one medicine from the drugstore. This leads us to conclude that both medicines were intended as an arsenic-containing mixture because they were described with identical words: \\"fine white powder\\", suggesting same composition; additionally another match between them was their appearance - again fine/coarse description suggests similarity of physical properties i.e., particle size vs fineness (powderiness).\\nThis leads us to answer Yes"},{"source":"Where are you if your bieifcase is going through an x-ray machine?\\n\\n[Options]\\n- luggage store\\n- courtroom\\n- airport\\n- office building\\n- hand","target":"airport","rationale":"Briefcases are found in airports.

Also in 1913, the Irish Citizen Army was founded by the trade unionists and socialists James Larkin and James Connolly following a series of violent incidents between trade unionists and the Dublin police in the Dublin lock-out. In June 1914, Nationalist leader John Redmond forced the Volunteers to give his nominees a majority on the ruling committee. When, in September 1914, Redmond encouraged the Volunteers to enlist in the British Army, a faction led by Eoin MacNeill broke with the Redmondites, who became known as the National Volunteers, rather than fight for Britain in the war. Many of the National Volunteers did enlist, and the majority of the men in the 16th  Division of the British Army had formerly served in the National Volunteers. The Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army launched the Easter Rising against British rule in 1916, when an Irish Republic was proclaimed. Thereafter they became known as the Irish Republican Army . Between 1919-21 the IRA claimed to have a total strength of 70,000, but only about 3,000 were actively engaged in fighting against the Crown. The IRA distrusted those Irishmen who had fought in the British Army during the First World War, but there were a number of exceptions such as Emmet Dalton, Tom Barry and Martin Doyle. The basic structure of the IRA was the \\"flying column\\" which could number between 20 and 100 men.

At the same time, Alejandro gets a burst of adrenaline and presses down \\nvery hard on the gas pedal in his car.\\n\\nHint: A car’s gas pedal, like the one in Figure below , is sometimes called the accelerator. That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force.","target":"Alejandro","rationale":"The context of the situation is that Jordan and Alejandro are currently in an intense car race.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.\\n\\nand the situation: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants.

We identify how local maxima can emerge from the marginal log-likelihood of pPCA, which yields similar local maxima for the evidence lower bound (ELBO). We show that training a linear VAE with variational inference recovers a uniquely identifiable global maximum corresponding to the principal component directions. We provide empirical evidence that the presence of local maxima causes posterior collapse in deep non-linear VAEs. Our findings help to explain a wide range of heuristic approaches in the literature that attempt to diminish the effect of the KL term in the ELBO to reduce posterior collapse.","target":"We show that posterior collapse in linear VAEs is caused entirely by marginal log-likelihood (not ELBO).

Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\\nThat’s right, you STOP!\\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\\nThis isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators.

The purpose of the lessons in this unit is to help Ohio students in grades 5-7 learn the characteristics of the literary text MOOD and SETTING indicators that they must master for their respective Ohio achievement tests. Definition of Mood. As a literary device, mood is the emotional feeling or atmosphere that a work of literature produces in a reader. All works of literature produce some sort of emotional and psychological effect in the audience; though every reader may respond differently to the same work of literature there is often a similar type of mood produced. Some of the best examples of this are below. 1  Frozen as a horror film: 2  Mary Poppins as a horror film: Video Player. 3  Dumb and Dumber was turned into a horror film, Lurk and Lurker: Video Player. 4  The Shining was transformed from horror film into a feel-good romantic comedy: Video Player. Whatever tone, mood, and style you decide on for your stories, realize that those elements contribute to the story’s feel. _____ Recognize that even if you don’t purposely create tone and mood, they are still created for your stories and scenes. They may be muddled and the cause of weak responses to your fiction, but they’re there, in the story. Make a point to purposely work tone and mood to the story’s advantage by your style choices. Mood is the emotions that you (the reader) feel while you are reading. Some literature makes you feel sad, others joyful, still others, angry. The main purpose for some poems is to set a mood. Writers use many devices to create mood, including images, dialogue, setting, and plot. Often a writer creates a mood at the beginning of the story and continues it to the end. However, sometimes the mood changes because of the plot or changes in characters. Summary: Mood Literary Definition. Define mood in literature: The definition of mood in literature is the overall feeling and author creates for his audience. Mood is the atmosphere the text creates. In a way, it’s all of the “unsaid” elements that create a feeling the text provides for the audience. Mood is essential to engage readers. Let us see how writers use the afore-mentioned elements in their literary works to create a particular mood. Creating Mood through Setting Setting is the physical location in a piece of literature that provides background in which the events of the narrative take place. A particular setting not only provides support to the contents of the story, but also sets the mood of the readers. Let us analyze a few examples of mood developed using a setting: Mood (literature) In literature, mood is the atmosphere of the narrative. Mood is created by means of setting (locale and surroundings in which the narrative takes place), attitude (of the narrator and of the characters in the narrative), and descriptions. Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree. Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story. For example, during the Great Depression, the mood in the USA was somber. People lost their jobs, went hungry and experienced a wide range of emotions. Words such as frightened, panicked and depressed are commonly used to describe people's moods during this time. Moods in Literature In literature, mood is the feeling created in the reader. This feeling is the result of both the tone and atmosphere of the story. The author's attitude or approach to a character or situation is the tone of a story. The tone sets the mood of the story. Atmosphere is the feeling created by mood and tone. The atmosphere takes the reader to where the story is happening and lets them experience it much like the characters. Some common moods found in literature include: Style, tone, and mood combine to make your stories your own, something no one else could create. And if you changed the tone or mood of multiple scenes or of a story as a whole, you’d create a new story quite unlike the original.

Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work. According to The Times: \\"Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from Bowie\\". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \\"parting gift\\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \\"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day.

Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as Pac-Man would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions.

New Orleans Head Coach and former Dallas Offensive Coordinator, as well as Passing Coordinator, Sean Payton thoroughly dissected the Cowboys defense by showcasing the talents of Drew Brees, Reggie Bush, and Deuce McAllister.  Perhaps more surprising was the performance of  Mike Karney.  Previously an unknown fullback who had never had a touchdown in his 43 NFL games, Karney scored a hat trick (three touchdowns).  Brees topped 4,000 season passing yards for the first time in his career, having 26 completions for 38 attempts and 384 yards and five touchdowns.  Deuce McCallister and Reggie Bush both proved their worth with 135 and 162 all-purpose yards, respectively.  Payton was even feeling so confident as to attempt an onside kick early in the third quarter, further demoralizing the Cowboys and increasing momentum for the Saints when they recovered it.  With 3 minutes left in the game and the ball deep in Cowboys territory, Payton's Saints went to kneeling, either to let Parcells keep some of his pride intact, or to make a statement. The Cowboys had one of the worst games of their season.  Payton's defense never gave them a chance to get into a rhythm, and Tony Romo threw for 16 completions of 33 attempts for 249 yards for a single touchdown and a pair of interceptions.  The Cowboys started out promising, stopping the Saints' offense and Julius Jones responding with a career record 77-yard touchdown run.  Though after that play, nothing seemed to go right.  Gramatica missed another crucial field goal, soaring wide right, and the only other touchdown came from a fourth-down pass to Terrell Owens that could have been an interception had cornerback Fred Thomas not had a cast on his hand. New Orleans defeated Dallas 42-17, snapping Dallas' four-game winning streak and dropping them to 8-5 while improving their own record to 9-4.

From 1975 to 1983, the Undertones consisted of Feargal Sharkey (vocals), John O'Neill (rhythm guitar, vocals), Damian O'Neill (lead guitar, vocals), Michael Bradley (bass, vocals) and Billy Doherty (drums). Much of the earlier Undertones material drew influence from punk rock and new wave; the Undertones also incorporated elements of rock, glam rock and post-punk into material released after 1979, before citing soul and Motown as the influence for the material released upon their final album. The Undertones released thirteen singles and four studio albums between 1978 and 1983 before Sharkey announced his intention to leave the band in May 1983, citing musical differences as the reason for the break up.\\nContext: By 1977 the band were performing their own three-chord pop punk material, which was performed alongside cover versions at concerts, primarily at The Casbah, where the band began to perform in February. The Undertones had occasionally earned money at venues where they had performed throughout 1976, but these gigs at The Casbah were the first performances for which the Undertones were paid on a regular basis, as performing at The Casbah earned the group up to PS40 a week. This inspired the band to write and rehearse further material, as a means of remaining a popular act at this venue. By mid-year, the concerts the Undertones performed would include the song \\"Teenage Kicks\\", which had been written by guitarist John O'Neill in mid-1977. The gigs performed at The Casbah gave the Undertones increased confidence in their musical ability, and in June 1977 they performed concerts outside Derry for the first time, supporting a Dublin punk group named The Radiators from Space.  In March 1978, the Undertones recorded a demo tape at Magee University in Derry and sent copies of the tape to various record companies in the hope of securing a record deal, but only received official letters of rejection. The band had also sent a copy of their recordings to influential BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, requesting he play the songs on his radio programme. Peel replied to the band, offering to pay for a recording session in Belfast. On 16 June 1978, the band recorded their debut four-song EP \\"Teenage Kicks\\" on a budget of only PS200. The EP was engineered by Davy Shannon at Wizard Sound Studios, Belfast - and was released on Belfast's Good Vibrations record label. The title song became a hit with support from John Peel, who considered Teenage Kicks his all-time favourite song, an opinion he held until his death in 2004.  Seymour Stein, the president of Sire Records - in London on business - heard John Peel play \\"Teenage Kicks\\" on BBC Radio 1 and became interested in the band. Stein sent a London-based representative named Paul McNally to Derry to discuss a record deal with the band. McNally saw the band play live in what would ultimately prove to be their final performance at The Casbah on 29 September 1978. The following day, McNally convened with the Undertones to discuss a record contract. Three members of the band signed the proposed contract on this date, with the understanding that Feargal Sharkey and Michael Bradley would discuss negotiations to the contract with Seymour Stein in person in London.\\nQuestion: What else is significant about this?.

Pepper (Marissa Rago) angrily erupts over being awakened, but July (Nanea Miyata) jumps to Molly's defense. Annie breaks up the scuffle, and comforts Molly by telling her she was just having another nightmare. Molly admits that he misses her parents terribly, but Pepper, apparently believing that heavy armor is the surest defense, curtly reminds her that they are orphans, that they neither have, nor ever will have, parents. Annie retorts that she is not an orphan - that her parents are alive and are coming back for her, and Molly chirps triumphantly that Annie has a note to prove it. Molly asks Annie to read the note aloud once more, something Annie has done so often that the other girls know its contents quite well:\\"Please take care of our little darling. Her name is Annie.

Passage 1:In 1996 Guillermo Martinez began wrestling under the name \\"Bombero Infernal\\", complete with a mask and ring gear adorned in flames and diabolical images. He had only worked under that name for just over a year when he became involved in a storyline feud against El Pantera, the rivalry escalated to the point where both wrestlers agreed to put their masks on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", the most prestigious match type in Lucha Libre. The match took place on December 7, 1997 in International Wrestling Revolution Group's (IWRG) Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico with Bombero Infernal losing the match, which forced him to unmask in the middle of the ring, state his birthname and how long he had been a wrestler. Oftentimes losing the mask means the end of a specific ring character, but Martinez stuck with the Bombero Infernal ring characters in the years after his loss. On January 10, 1999 Bombero Infernal won the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship from Mr. Niebla and held the championship for 146 days straight. The title change was part of a long running storyline between Bombero and Mr. Niebla that saw Mr. Niebla regain the championship on June 6, 1999 but ultimately lose it to Bombero Infernal once again on October 24, 1999. His second reign ended at the hands of Último Vampiro on December 16, 1999 when he defeated Bombero Infernal. In late 2000 Bombero Infernal teamed up with Cripta and El Enterrador to defeat the team of Super Caló, Alan Stone and Moto Cross to win the Distrito Federal Trios Championship. On November 19, 2000 Bombero Infernal regained the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship from Último Vampiro. Bombero's time as a double champion ended on February 11, 2001 when Los Oficiales (Guardia, Oficial and Virgilante) won the DF Trios Championship. A month later he also lost the Middleweight Championship to Black Dragon. Later that year Bombero Infernal defeated Último Vampiro to win the Middleweight Championship for a fourth time, at the time someone other than the previous Último Vampiro was playing the character. The match between the two ended in a controversial fashion, leading IWRG to take the championship away from Bombero Infernal only one week later. In 2002 Bombero Infernal rekindled his storyline with El Pantera, going so far as to put his hair on the line against Pantera's Middleweight Championship, in a match that saw Bombero victoriously claim his fifth IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 134 resources, which included 112 contributing buildings, one contributing site, 20 non-contributing buildings, and one non-contributing structure. This neighborhood first developed as a sparsely populated rural area, and between World War I and World War II developed into an automobile suburb. It grew along with the University of Iowa when it expanded to the west side of the Iowa River, and it borders the large University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics complex. Among the prominent people who lived here was Howard Jones who coached the Iowa football team from 1916 to 1923. Other prominent residents included professors and local professionals and politicians. \\n Passage 3:The Sweden national football team has traditionally been a strong team in international football, with eleven World Cup appearances—collecting one silver and two bronze medals—and three medals in the Olympics, including one gold. Sweden played its first international game against Norway in 1908 and competed in an international tournament, the Summer Olympics, for the first time the same year. Since then, Sweden has regularly qualified for the World Cup and the Olympics as well as the European Championships. The best results in the World Cup are a second place (as hosts) in the 1958 and two third places in 1950 and 1994. In the Olympics, Sweden has won the gold medal in 1948 as well as two bronze medals in 1924 and 1952.

Davidson was a nationally acclaimed expert in folklore, especially that of Colorado and the West. He was born in Eureka, Illinois May 16, 1894, one of four children. Because his grand uncle was past-President of Eureka College, a Christian seminary, Davidson was reared in the school's shadow with the option of becoming either a teacher or a preacher. He chose teaching and was awarded his B.A. from Eureka in 1915. A year later he received his A.M. degree from the University of Illinois where he received Phi Beta Kappa honors. In 1917 he earned his M.A. in social science and history at Harvard University. __During World War I, he served with the Tenth Infantry of the Forty-Sixth Division and also served as an army sergeant in Intelligence. Davidson and his wife Mary, also a graduate of Eureka, were married in 1918. At the end of the war, Davidson simultaneously taught and studied at the University of Michigan where he earned a Ph.D. in languages and literatures in 1922. He arrived in Denver later that year and began teaching at the University of Denver. Before arriving in Colorado, his academic specialty was eighteenth century England. Once in Denver, he realized that Western literature and folklore would be his life work. Davidson taught at the University of Denver until his death in 1957. His course topics ranged from studies of Shakespeare and other English literature, to folklore in the West. He began teaching news writing and eventually founded the journalism department at the University as well as the board of publications and the press club. He was the first faculty member elected to serve as president of the University Senate. In 1940 he became head of the English Department and from March to August 1953 he served as interim Chancellor. At the time of assuming his post, he remarked: There is hardly an organization on campus that I have not been connected with at one time or another. Davidson was named University Lecturer for 1956. Davidson was a director of the Colorado State Historical Society, the Modern Languages Association, the American Folklore Society, and the American Dialect Society. He was a charter member of the Denver Posse of the Westerners, an organization devoted to western folklore. In spare moments, Davidson conducted research, wrote outlines for plays, and authored a large number of articles. He contributed to a wide range of magazines from Western American to Shakespeare Quarterly. Additionally, Davidson authored several books on folklore. The most widely recognized is Rocky Mountain Tales, which presents regional folklore as well as true accounts of early events in the area. Levette Davidson died May 14, 1957.","target":"b","rationale":"The passage provides information about Davidson's education, but not where he got his M.A. Therefore, the passage can't be used to answer the question."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences where the second sentence is missing.

Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum.\\n\\n- A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\\n\\n- In mathematics , a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements . For example , the sequence \\\\ langle A , B , D \\\\ rangle is a subsequence of \\\\ langle A , B , C , D , E , F \\\\ rangle obtained after removal of elements C , E , and F. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a preorder . The subsequence should not be confused with substring \\\\ langle A , B , C , D \\\\ rangle which can be derived from the above string \\\\ langle A , B , C , D , E , F \\\\ rangle by deleting substring \\\\ langle E , F \\\\ rangle . The substring is a refinement of the subsequence .\\n\\n- In mathematics, especially in order theory, a preorder or quasiorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive. Preorders are more general than equivalence relations and (non-strict) partial orders, both of which are special cases of a preorder.\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is at the same time a reflexive relation, a symmetric relation and a transitive relation. As a consequence of these properties an equivalence relation provides a partition of a set into equivalence classes.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed. Like a set, it contains members (also called \\"elements\\", or \\"terms\\"). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the \\"length\\" of the sequence. Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first \\"n\\" natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length \\"n\\"). The position of an element in a sequence is its \\"rank\\" or \\"index\\"; it is the integer from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or of a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1. When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the \\"n\\"th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with \\"n\\" as subscript; for example, the \\"n\\"th element of the Fibonacci sequence is generally denoted \\"F\\".\\n\\n- In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in \\"there are \\"six\\" coins on the table\\") and ordering (as in \\"this is the \\"third\\" largest city in the country\\"). In common language, words used for counting are \\"cardinal numbers\\" and words used for ordering are \\"ordinal numbers\\".\\n\\n- Order theory is a branch of mathematics which investigates the intuitive notion of order using binary relations. It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as \\"this is less than that\\" or \\"this precedes that\\". This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions. A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the order theory glossary.\\n\\n- Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a binary relation on a set \\"A\\" is a collection of ordered pairs of elements of \\"A\\". In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product \\"A\\" = . More generally, a binary relation between two sets \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" is a subset of .

I’m in my last year now. A couple of days ago, my sister also moved back with plans to start grad school in the fall. So...it’s a little crowded. My sister rented a uhaul for her stuff and had it parked in front of the house. My mom and I took it back yesterday, with my mom driving the truck and me following behind in my car. Then, we drove back home together.\\n\\nMy family and I live in a row house. There’s a parking spot right in front of the house, and another one down the street. Those spots are where my parents park, and I usually park on the street. So I’m driving my mom home and I go to park where I usually park, and she tells me to just park in the spot in front of the house. I kind of protest, because I don’t want to have to move my car later, and tell her I’ll just drop her off in front of the house and then go park on the street. At this point she gets a little irritated with me and tells me to just park in front of the house and leave it alone. I’m like, fine, whatever, not a big deal. \\n\\nLater that day my dad comes home and asks why I’m parked in front of the house. I told him what happened with my mom. I can tell he’s kind of annoyed that I parked there, but I don’t think it’s a big deal so I just brush it off. \\n\\nNow today, I have the day off and I’m just hanging out at home. I go to the basement and am working out on the treadmill when my dad comes down the stairs. He says: “hey, so your mother and I had a discussion about the parking spot and it’s okay if you move your car”. Now at this point I’m irritated. I said something along the lines of “what are you talking about? I know I’m ALLOWED to move my car, all I said is that I parked there because mom told me to and I didn’t feel like arguing with her!” Now I know I kind of blew up here, but I was annoyed because  i could tell he just wanted me to move my car and I don’t like when people beat around the bush. \\n\\nI finished my workout, took a shower, then I’m just in the living room when here comes my dad again. He looks at me and says “you know, whatever issues your mother and I are having with the parking spot, you don’t have to get into the middle of them”.\\n\\nSo now I’m furious. I tell him “I have no idea what you’re talking about! If you want me to move my car, just ask me to!” And he just walks away.\\n\\nSo I’ve decided I’m not moving the car unless he explicitly asks me to. It’s now apparent to me that my mom told me to park in the spot to piss off my dad. But honestly that’s none of my business and I had no idea when I parked in the spot.

Substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants. Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products. Reactants and products can be elements or compounds. A chemical reaction can be represented by this general equation: Reactants ! Products The arrow (!) shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. The reaction may occur quickly or slowly. For example, foam shoots out of a fire extinguisher as soon as the lever is pressed. But it might take years for metal to rust. In chemical reactions, bonds break in the reactants and new bonds form in the products. The reactants and prod- ucts contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants. Look at the example in Figure 8.2. It shows how water forms. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. Then new bonds form in molecules of water. In both reactants and products, there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. But the atoms are combined differently in water. You can see another example at this URL: [Link] The arrow in Figure 8.2 shows that the reaction goes from left to right, from hydrogen and oxygen to water. The reaction can also go in the reverse direction. If an electric current passes through water, water molecules break down into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction would be represented by a right-to-left arrow ( ) in Figure Many other reactions can also go in both forward and reverse directions. Often, a point is reached at which the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. When this happens, there is no overall change in the amount of reactants and products. This point is called equilibrium, which refers to a balance between any opposing changes. You can see an animation of a chemical reaction reaching equilibrium at this URL: Not all changes in matter involve chemical reactions. For example, there are no chemical reactions involved in changes of state. When liquid water freezes or evaporates, it is still water. No bonds are broken and no new products are formed. How can you tell whether a change in matter involves a chemical reaction? Often, there is evidence. Four common signs that a chemical reaction has occurred are: Change in color: the products are a different color than the reactants. Change in temperature: heat is released or absorbed during the reaction. Production of a gas: gas bubbles are released during the reaction. Production of a solid: a solid settles out of a liquid solution. The solid is called a precipitate.

Compared with the EPO (n = 33) and Control (n = 32) groups, the pUCB (n = 31) group had significantly higher scores on the GMPM and BSID-II Mental and Motor scales at 6 months. DTI revealed significant correlations between the GMPM increment and changes in fractional anisotropy in the pUCB group. 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed differential activation and deactivation patterns between the three groups. The incidence of serious adverse events did not differ between groups. In conclusion, UCB treatment ameliorated motor and cognitive dysfunction in children with CP undergoing active rehabilitation, accompanied by structural and metabolic changes in the brain.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract is organized into three sections, which provide an introduction to the study, a description of the methods used in the study, and a summary of the main findings.

We established an assay system for the measurement of small amounts of anti-CPAg IgE antibody, both in an antigen-specific and isotype-specific manner, and a culture system to induce antigen-driven IgE antibody synthesis in vitro. By using these methods, we clarified that the function of the HLA-DR molecule in the CPAg-driven IgE response is similar to that of I-A or I-E molecule in mice, namely the product of immune response genes (Ir-genes), because anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody blocked the response, and the interaction between monocyte and monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to respond to CPAg was restricted by HLA-DR. Furthermore, PBL from nonresponders revealed a specific IgE response to CPAg when the Leu-2+3- T cell fraction was depleted, thereby suggesting that even nonresponders have Leu-2-3+ T cell and B cell clones specific for CPAg, and they apparently show no response due to the presence of CPAg-specific Leu-2+3- suppressor T cells. This suppressor T cell fraction abolished the IgE response of the autologous B + monocyte + Leu-2-3+ T cell in a CPAg-specific manner. The current cellular analysis together with our previous genetic analysis strongly suggest that the HLA-linked IgE nonresponse to CPAg is mediated by CPAg-specific suppressor T cells. The HLA-linked gene controlling the nonresponsiveness to CPAg is thus designated as the immune suppression gene for CPAg (Is-CPAg). Mapping of Is-CPAg within HLA-DQ subregion is discussed. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data in the form of numbers and percentages that are used to quantify the results of different measurements.

Both types of cells exhibit elevated permeabilities to sodium and potassium, in the case of sickle cells, when deoxygenated. The ouabain-insensitive fluxes of sodium and potassium were equivalent, however, in both cell types under these conditions. When incubated 18 hours in vitro, sickle cells lost cations but only when deoxygenated. This cation depletion was blocked by ouabain, removal of external potassium, or pretreatment with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, which blocks the increase in cation permeability induced by deoxygenation. The loss of cation exhibited by oxygenated xerocytes similarly incubated was also blocked by ouabain. These data support the hypothesis that the elevated \\"passive\\" cation fluxes of xerocytes and deoxygenated sickle cells are not directly responsible for cation depletion of these cells; rather, these pathologic leaks interact with the sodium pump to produce a net loss of cellular cation.","target":"Cation depletion by the sodium pump in red cells with pathologic cation leaks.

He led the league in receiving touchdowns twice, and is a member of the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team. He is the Bears' all-time leader in receiving touchdowns, with 50.\\nContext: Kavanaugh was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. He graduated from Little Rock Central High School in 1936.  Kavanaugh arrived at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1936 and joined the LSU football varsity team in 1937. As an end, he was quickly able to fill the void in the offense left by the departure of two-time All-American Gaynell Tinsley. At 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m), Kavanaugh was a large receiver for his time, and used his size to outreach defenders. Bernie Moore, Kavanaugh's head coach at LSU, said Kavanaugh \\"was a pass completer rather than a receiver, simply because he'd catch passes no one else could get to.\\" He was named to the Associated Press (AP) All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) second alternate team after the 1937 season. In 1938, the AP named him a first-team All-SEC selection, and he was a second-team selection by the United Press.  In 1939, in a game against Holy Cross, Kavanaugh caught four touchdown passes in the 26-7 win. According to Kavanaugh and teammate Young Bussey, Kavanaugh found four rusty nails on the sideline during the game. The next week against Rice, he found another nail and scored another touchdown to give LSU a 7-0 win. The pattern continued against Loyola and Vanderbilt, as Kavanaugh found two nails before each game and in each scored two touchdowns. A sportswriter for the Baton Rouge Advocate claimed he saw coach Bernie Moore at a local store stocking up on nails before LSU's game against No. 1 Tennessee. Kavanaugh failed to score in the game, however, as the Tigers lost 20-0.  The Nashville Banner named Kavanaugh co-MVP of the Southeastern Conference for 1939 along with Bob Foxx of Tennessee. Kavanaugh was a consensus All-America selection for the 1939 All-America Team, being named to the team by five of the nine official selectors.

Because they were observing radio silence, Nishimura was unable to synchronize with Shima and Kurita. Nishimura and Shima had failed to even coordinate their plans before the attacks – they were long-time rivals and neither wished to have anything to do with the other. When he entered the narrow Surigao Strait at about 02:00, Shima was 22 miles (40 km) behind him, and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea, several hours from the beaches at Leyte. As they passed Panaon Island, Nishimura's force ran into a trap set for them by the U.S.-Australian 7th Fleet Support Force. R. Adm. Jesse Oldendorf had six battleships, four heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, 29 destroyers and 39 PT boats. To pass the strait and reach the landings, Nishimura had to run the gauntlet. At about 03:00 the Japanese battleship Fusō and three destroyers were hit by torpedoes and Fusō broke in two. At 03:50 the U.S. battleships opened fire. Radar fire control meant they could hit targets from a much greater distance than the Japanese. The battleship Yamashiro, a cruiser and a destroyer were crippled by 16-inch (406 mm) shells; Yamashiro sank at 04:19. Only one of Nishimura's force of seven ships survived the engagement.

It does not require the sample to be ionized, and it does not produce any secondary ions or fragments. This makes the TCD a universal detector, which responds to the concentration of analytes in the mobile phase. The flame ionization detector (FID) is also a universal type of gas chromatography detectors that is sensitive to almost all kinds of hydrocarbon gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, it requires the analyte molecules in gaseous state at high temperature for its operation. Hence, option (2) is incorrect as FID can only respond to certain types of hydrocarbons gases and VOCs but not all types of analytes. Option <3> correctly states that TCD responds to analyte concentration; hence it cannot be selective based on this property alone as stated in option <1>. The nitrogen phosphorus detection system (NPD) uses thermal conductivity measurement for detecting nitrogen-containing compounds like amino acids, amines etc., which are thermally labile when subjected to high temperatures during their separation by GC column; so NPD cannot be a selective type of detector for these types of compound as per option <4>. The thermocalorimeter detects compounds based on their degree or extent of molecular interaction with other substances present in the mobile phase; so its response may vary depending upon different samples being analyzed with respect to different concentrations and components present in them making it an integral rather than differential type instrument as per option <5>."},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the hapless housemaid?\\n\\nTom is chasing Jerry around Mammy Two Shoes, while she is yelling out confusing instructions on where to chase Jerry.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...\\n\\nParagraph: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers.

There's been a lot of buzz about the fact that this book wasn't popular when it was by an unknown author and then became bestselling after people found out it was written by J.K. Rowling. This has led to speculation about what this means for the publishing industry, what it means for unknown authors trying to get published, etc. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT. True, I may not have picked up this book if it hadn't been written by Ms. Rowling, but regardless, I did read it and I liked it, so there you go.Also, my husband kindly bought a copy of this for me on our recent trip to London, so I technically read the \\"British\\" version--I'm sure some things have been \\"Americanized\\" in the version available in the U.S., but I'm guessing there aren't any substantive differences.All disclaimers aside, I thought this was a really, REALLY well done private investigator procedural. The plot was exciting, and I thought the characters were marvelous. J.K. Rowling is such a keen observer of people, I think, and it really shows in her writing. Cormoran Strike, our hero, is perfectly flawed in just the way I love characters to be.There was such an interesting dynamic between the two main characters, unlike any I have ever read. Cormoran Strike is the private investigator, and Robin is a temp who shows up at Strike's office on a Monday morning. However, Strike thought he canceled the temp arrangement, due to the fact that he has pretty much no money. The scene where Robin and Strike meet (actually physically crash into each other) is just so perfect. There's nothing overtly hilarious about it, but I love how Rowling uses subtle humor. For example, soon after Robin arrives for her first day of work, a client shows up (an extremely rare event). Robin does not want to let on to the client that she is not the regular secretary, thinking it will reflect poorly on Strike. So she suffers through Strike calling her Sandra multiple times, and then asks them very professionally if she can get them anything to drink. They both ask for coffee with sugar:-------------He saw her mouth twist as she closed the door behind her, and only then did he remember that he did not have any coffee, sugar or, indeed, cups.-------------I know what you're thinking--oh the characters get together and it's a romance, too! Nope. That's part of what I loved about it--it's such an unusual relationship to write. The down-on-his-luck PI trying to solve a difficult case and his temp secretary who he's just met trying to assist him. So original.The central mystery of the story is very well done, and I kept flipping the pages faster and faster to try to get to the bottom of it. At one point, I remember thinking to myself, \\"There are literally 15 people who I think are possibly guilty at this point.\\" That's like Agatha Christie level of skill, people. It's Murder on the Orient Express, except, you know, without the train. And the way it did end I thought was completely masterful. Twist after twist and turn after turn, there is no way you will see it coming.We know Strike has a huge backstory, most of which we only get in bits and pieces throughout this novel. I guess that is my one and only complaint about this one--there were a lot of things that felt unfinished (and some parts that seemed like digressions from the main story)--but I suppose this makes sense for the first book in a series. I can't wait for future installments to find out more about what exactly happened to him in the army, why he left, more about the history between him and his ex-fianc&eacute;e, and to see if anything except mutual respect ever develops between him and Robin. There were also some interesting things alluded to about Robin's past, and I hope those are also explored in more detail.To me, the fact that this book is written by J.K. Rowling doesn't come as much of a surprise. Good writing: check. Well-developed characters with room for more development: check. Intricate and detail-oriented plot: check. Also, I read somewhere that if you think about it, the Harry Potter novels are sort of like thrillers/mysteries. So it's not surprising to me that Rowling can keep the page-turning suspense going, just using a slightly different medium.BOTTOM LINEI LOVED IT. I consumed like 100 pages of this book at a time. Seriously, if you are a fan of detective fiction, good writing, excellent characters, and a book that will continually keep you guessing, you should pick this one up. I personally can't wait to read more about the adventures of Cormoran Strike, PI, and am anxiously awaiting the second book in the series! Do you ever finish a book and then just really miss the characters and wish you were still reading it? And even if you pick up another book that is quite good, you sort of glance longingly at the previous book, remembering all the good times you had together?

It revived interest in the bolero genre and was the first record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil, Taiwan, and the United States.

When asked why he chose not to record more boleros, he replied \\"I wanted to try my music, just forgetting a little bit about those boleros that everyone knows\\". He began working with the composers for the album a year before recording in a studio in 1992; in Miguel's words, he wanted to \\"discuss the works, the themes, and melodies; ...

However, recognition of eosinophiluria by Wright's staining is technically difficult, and the spectrum of disorders causing eosinophiluria is not completely defined. We have adapted Hansel's stain for the examination of urinary sediment. Whereas there was a variable uptake of Wright's stain by eosinophils in the urine, such eosinophils were readily recognized with Hansel's stain by the presence of bright red granules. The prevalence of eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis was 10 of 11 patients, in acute tubular necrosis none of 30, in acute pyelonephritis none of 10, in acute cystitis 1 of 15, in postinfectious glomerulonephritis 1 of 6, in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis 4 of 10, and in acute prostatitis 6 of 10. Eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis was demonstrated by Hansel's stain in 10 of 11 patients but by Wright's stain in only 2 of 11 patients. We conclude that Hansel's stain substantially improves the recognition of eosinophiluria as compared with Wright's stain.

A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages.

A penguin only needs to move 2cm in any direction for its neighbor to do the same thing.

Pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) influenza A virus caused massive infection in 2009 and currently circulates worldwide. Avian influenza A H9N2 (H9N2/G1) virus has infected humans and has the potential to be the next pandemic virus. Antiviral function and immunomodulatory role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection have not been investigated. Methods. In this study, MBL wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) murine models were used to examine the role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection. Results. Our study demonstrated that in vitro, MBL binds to pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 viruses, likely via the carbohydrate recognition domain of MBL. Wild-type mice developed more severe disease, as evidenced by a greater weight loss than MBL KO mice during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, MBL WT mice had enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with MBL KO mice, suggesting that MBL could upregulate inflammatory responses that may potentially worsen pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infections.

Single B cell sorting and cloning of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-and light-chain variable regions (V H and V L ) is a powerful technology for defining anti-viral B cell repertoires. However, the Ig-cloning step is time-consuming and prevents high-throughput analysis of the B cell repertoire. Novel linear Ig heavy-and light-chain gene expression cassettes were designed to express Ig V H and V L genes isolated from sorted single B cells as IgG1 antibody without a cloning step. The cassettes contain all essential elements for transcriptional and translational regulation, including CMV promoter, Ig leader sequences, constant region of IgG1 heavy-or Ig light-chain, poly(A) tail and substitutable V H or V L genes. The utility of these Ig gene expression cassettes was established using synthetic V H or V L genes from an anti-HIV-1 gp41 mAb 2F5 as a model system, and validated further using V H and V L genes isolated from cloned EBV-transformed antibody-producing cell lines. Finally, this strategy was successfully used for rapid production of recombinant influenza mAbs from sorted single human plasmablasts after influenza vaccination.

Bach is a fictitious composer invented by musical satirist \\"Professor\\" Peter Schickele. Schickele developed a five-decade-long career, performing the \\"discovered\\" works of the \\"only forgotten son\\" of the Bach family. Schickele's music combines parodies of musicological scholarship, the conventions of Baroque and classical music, and slapstick. The name \\"P. D. Q.\\" is a parody of the three-part names given to some members of the Bach family that are commonly reduced to initials, such as C. P. E., for Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach.\\n\\nSchickele's works attributed to P. D. Q. Bach often incorporate comical rearrangements of well-known works of other composers. The works use instruments not normally used in orchestras, such as the bagpipes, slide whistle, kazoo, and fictional or experimental instruments such as the pastaphone (made of uncooked manicotti), tromboon, hardart, lasso d'amore, and left-handed sewer flute.  There is often a startling juxtaposition of styles within a single P. D. Q. Bach piece. The Prelude to Einstein on the Fritz, which alludes to Philip Glass' opera Einstein on the Beach, provides an example. The underlying music is J.S. Bach's first prelude from The Well-Tempered Clavier, but at double the normal speed, with each phrase repeated interminably in a minimalist manner that parodies Glass's. On top of this mind-numbing structure is added everything from jazz phrases to snoring to heavily harmonized versions of \\"Three Blind Mice\\" to the chanting of a meaningless phrase (\\"Koy Hotsy-Totsy,\\" alluding to the art film Koyaanisqatsi for which Glass wrote the score). Through all these mutilations, the piece never deviates from Bach's original harmonic structure.  The humor in P. D. Q. Bach music often derives from violation of audience expectations, such as repeating a tune more than the usual number of times, resolving a musical chord later than usual or not at all, unusual key changes, excessive dissonance, or sudden switches from high art to low art. Further humor is obtained by replacing parts of certain classical pieces with similar common songs, such as the opening of Brahms' Symphony No. 2 with \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\", or rewriting Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture as the 1712 Overture, with \\"Yankee Doodle\\" replacing Tchaikovsky's melody, and \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" replacing \\"La Marseillaise\\".

Generally, some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on \\"the accumulation of close parallels\\", but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world. Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the ruler's court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain, the only likely point of transmission, after the establishment of the first medieval universities. In fact, there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and, most importantly, no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation, something they would have certainly found noteworthy. Rather, it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion. Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having \\"common problems: to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities, and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy\\"; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other, a view shared by Hugh Kennedy.","target":"transmission","rationale":"The question asks you to find the answer in \\"the following context\\".

Her eighteen books and numerous articles, on topics ranging from totalitarianism to epistemology, had a lasting influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century. As a Jew, Arendt chose to leave Nazi Germany in 1933, and lived in Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and France before escaping to the United States in 1941 via Portugal.\\n\\nArendt was born into a secular family of German Jews in Linden (now a part of Hanover), the daughter of Martha (born Cohn) and Paul Arendt. She grew up in Konigsberg (renamed Kaliningrad when it was annexed to the Soviet Union in 1946) and Berlin. Arendt's family was thoroughly assimilated and she later remembered: \\"With us from Germany, the word 'assimilation' received a 'deep' philosophical meaning. You can hardly realize how serious we were about it.\\"  Arendt came to define her Jewish identity negatively after encountering antisemitism as an adult. She came to greatly identify with Rahel Varnhagen, a nineteenth-century Prussian hostess who desperately wanted to assimilate into German culture, only to be rejected because she was born Jewish. Arendt later said of Varnhagen that she was \\"my very closest woman friend, unfortunately dead a hundred years now.\\"  After completing her high school studies in 1924, she enrolled at the University of Marburg, where she spent a year studying philosophy with Martin Heidegger. According to Hans Jonas, her only German-Jewish classmate, in her year at the university, Arendt began a long and problematic romantic relationship with Heidegger, for which she was later criticized because of his support for the Nazi Party while he was rector at the University of Freiburg. After a year at Marburg, Arendt spent a semester at Freiburg University, attending the lectures of Edmund Husserl.

High blood pressure can damage the cells of your arteries' inner lining. 2  Aneurysm. Over time, the constant pressure of blood moving through a weakened artery can cause a section of its wall to enlarge and form a bulge (aneurysm). The damage can build over time. The excess strain and resulting damage from high blood pressure (HBP or hypertension) causes the coronary arteries serving the heart to slowly become narrowed from a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances that together are called plaque. This slow process is known as atherosclerosis. High blood pressure with a known cause is called secondary hypertension. Between 5% and 15% of people with high blood pressure have secondary hypertension. In many of these people, high blood pressure results from a kidney disorder.

At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. Xenon gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"improves efficiency","rationale":"The question is asking about the effect of using Xenon gas in light bulbs. The provided context states that inert gases (including xenon) improve efficiency and reduce filament evaporation; however, since they also conduct heat from the filament, their use is limited to smaller lamps.\\nSo Xenon improves efficiency while reducing filament evaporation but causes cooling which reduces efficiency and only allows for small lamps so it doesn't reach its full potential."},{"source":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.\\nQuestion: Where is a large city hall usually located?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. detroit\\n\\nB. major city\\n\\nC. downtown area\\n\\nD. dallas\\n\\nE. towns","target":"C","rationale":"City halls are usually located in the center of a city, also known as downtown.\\nSo, the answer is C"},{"source":"An example of an electrical circuit running properly would be\\n\\nA -> dimming lights\\n\\nB -> swimming in pools\\n\\nC -> running outside\\n\\nD -> riding bikes\\n\\nIs the right answer A, B, C or D ?","target":"A","rationale":"The correct answer is A.

The city houses the magnificent Angkor Wat, one of Cambodia's popular tourist attractions.\\n\\n- Angkor Wat (or \\"Capital Temple\\") is a temple complex in Cambodia and the largest religious monument in the world, with the site measuring . It was originally constructed as a Hindu temple of god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple toward the end of the 12th century. It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Yaodharapura (present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious center since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture.

Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. \\n\\n- \\" The ranat thum lek is a metallophone used in the classical music of Thailand.

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art.

Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history.\\n\\nWhile Ozzy Osbourne was working on new solo album material in 2006, Rhino Records released Black Sabbath: The Dio Years, a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single \\"The Devil Cried\\" reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the 1981 Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about the name of the group, Iommi stated \\"it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [and] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again.\\" Ward was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with \\"a couple of the band members\\". He was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the Mob Rules (1981) and Dehumanizer (1992) albums.  Heaven & Hell toured the U.S. with openers Megadeth and Machine Head, and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled Live from Radio City Music Hall. In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year. In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the Metal Masters Tour, alongside Judas Priest, Motorhead and Testament. The box set, The Rules of Hell, featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the name of their debut studio album, The Devil You Know, released on 28 April.  On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.

Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children.\\nIf Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas.\\nCreativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something.\\nUnluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems.\\nIt is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.\\n\\n- BBC Worldwide Ltd. is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC, formed out of a restructuring of its predecessor BBC Enterprises in 1995.

Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.\\n\\n- Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada.

Passage:His signature appears as a witness on a document dated 1629 claiming to be a deed for the sale of land by Indians to a group of settlers led by John Wheelwright on the south side of the Piscataqua River in what is now New Hampshire. This document was alleged to be a forgery by 19th century historian James Savage, based in part on evidence that Vines was in England at the time of the sale. In 1630 he was definitely involved in the establishment of settlements around Cape Elizabeth, Maine as part of Gorges' efforts to establish the proprietary Province of Maine. Gorges did not receive a royal charter for the land and a commission as governor until 1639, at which time Gorges appointed his cousin Thomas as deputy governor. Thomas Gorges established the government of the colony, and in 1642 he and Vines led an exploratory expedition into the interior that reached as far as the White Mountains. Gorges returned to England in 1643 to fight in the English Civil War. Government of the colony devolved to a council, which elected Vines deputy governor in 1644.

Since 2009, he has sold over 3 million albums and 5 million singles worldwide. Lambert rose to fame in 2009 after finishing as runner-up on the eighth season of American Idol. Later that year, he released his debut album, For Your Entertainment, which debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200.\\n\\nLambert is best known for his theatrical performance style and meticulous attention to detail in all aspects of his personal presentation. He draws upon extensive stage experience in the ease with which he can refine and define his image through fashion and other imagery, which are essential to how he chooses to inhabit his songs, rivet his audiences and showcase his individuality. While a contestant on American Idol, Lambert's precise yet varied stagings of himself kept audiences and judges glued as much to his presentation as to his vocal talent. His signature flamboyance and glam rock styling was a break-out moment in men's fashion, duly noted by fashion publications and taste-makers, who compared him to Lady Gaga in terms of crossing style boundaries and being unabashedly individual.  Lambert made three fashion related TV appearances at the close of 2010. He fused his passion for music and fashion on MTV's \\"Talk@Playground\\", appearing in discussion with Skingraft designer Jonny Cota. He was a guest judge on Project Runway, in an episode that styled a rock band for their upcoming Rolling Stone cover. He was the subject for whom the young designers of \\"All on the Line with Joe Zee\\" created a modern look, which he then critiqued along with the show's hosts.  Lambert continued to grace the covers of magazines, moving more specifically into the fashion and culture space. Reflecting the mood and concept behind his album Trespassing, the Fault Magazine fashion shoot exemplified Lambert's commitment to aligning the elements of his artistic vision so that a cohesive narrative emerges. When Lambert appeared on the December 2012 cover of London-based high style magazine Fiasco's \\"Obsession\\" issue, he again took the opportunity to manipulate and provoke with his image and style. Sporting a sophisticated, minimalist look that recalled old Hollywood, Lambert played with male stereotypes and representations; and in the interview, emphasized that his fashion and presentation are often disparate from gay as well as straight regimes: \\"For the general audience, they look at the way I style myself and they go, 'Errrr, that's gay', but you ask a handful of gay guys and they're like, 'I would never wear that!'\\" In August, 2015, he was one of four artists to appear on the cover of Billboard's \\"Music's Men of Style\\" issue. He discussed his natural shift towards a cleaner, more classic look; and reiterated that the intersection of music and fashion--the constant motion of trends--is a fascination and part of being a pop musician.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.

The interactions that occur when the respiratory epithelium encounters these viral and bacterial pathogens are poorly understood. We used Agilent bovine gene microarray chips containing 44,000 transcripts to elucidate bovine bronchial epithelial cell (BBEC) responses following in vitro exposure to BHV-1 alone, M. haemolytica alone, or both BHV-1 and M. haemolytica. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (>2-fold) of 978 transcripts by BHV-1 alone, 2040 transcripts by M. haemolytica alone, and 2189 genes by BHV-1 and M. haemolytica in combination. M. haemolytica treatment produced significantly greater inductions (>10-fold) of several inflammation associated genes, such as CXCL2, IL-6, IL-1␣, e-selectin, and IL-8, than to BHV-1 alone. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in important biological processes such as inflammation (TNF-␣, IL-8, Tlr-2, IL-1, CXCL2, CSF2), vascular functions (VEGF, EDN2) and leukocyte migration (ICAM1, IL-16) during a co-infection with BHV-1 and M. haemolytica compared to either pathogen alone.

Passage:Since the 1990s, United States college soccer has played a significant role in the development of New Zealand players. This influence began when former Scotland international Bobby Clark returned to the U.S. after his 1994–96 stint as New Zealand head coach to take the head coaching job at Stanford University (he now holds the same position at Notre Dame). Clark began recruiting in New Zealand, and former New Zealand national players Ryan Nelsen and Simon Elliott played for him at Stanford. The trend that Clark started has continued to the present; more than two dozen New Zealanders are now playing for NCAA Division I men's programs in the U.S. A common next step in these players' career paths is a stint in Major League Soccer; ESPN soccernet journalist Brent Latham speculated in a March 2010 story that New Zealand's 2010 FIFA World Cup squad could have more MLS players than the U.S. squad. However, Latham's speculation did not prove true, as only one MLS player made the New Zealand squad for the World Cup. New Zealand formerly competed against Australia for top honours in the OFC. However, after Australia left to join the AFC in 2006, New Zealand were left as the only seeded team in the OFC. New Zealand qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup though exited the competition after the first round despite being the only team not to lose a game during the tournament. The tournament also featured one of New Zealand's most notable results, a 1–1 draw with the then world champions Italy. New Zealand drew their other two pool games with Slovakia and Paraguay and ultimately finished above Italy, who placed last, in the group. New Zealand drew all three games and finished third in their group. New Zealand were also the only undefeated team in the entire tournament thanks to Spain's defeat to Switzerland.\\n Links: a.

They constitute about 75% of the Sri Lankan population and number greater than 16.2 million. The Sinhalese identity is based on language, historical heritage and religion. The Sinhalese people speak the Sinhalese language, an Indo-Aryan language, and are predominantly Theravada Buddhists, although a small percentage of Sinhalese follow branches of Christianity.\\nContext: Sinhalese cuisine is one of the most complex cuisines of South Asia. Due to its proximity to South India, Sinhalese cuisine shows some influence, yet is in many ways quite distinct. As a major trade hub, it draws influence from colonial powers that were involved in Sri Lanka and by foreign traders. Rice, which is consumed daily, can be found at any occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. Some of the Sri Lankan dishes have striking resemblance to Kerala cuisine, which could be due to the similar geographic and agricultural features with Kerala. A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is Kiribath, meaning \\"Milk Rice.\\" In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat \\"Mallung\\"- chopped leaves mixed with grated coconut and red onions. Coconut milk is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour.  Sri Lanka has long been renowned for its spices. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka. In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special curry, accompanied by frikkadels (meatballs), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include roast beef and roast chicken. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat.  The island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a \\"main curry\\" of fish or chicken, as well as several other curries made with vegetables, lentils and even fruit curries. Side-dishes include pickles, chutneys and \\"sambols\\". The most famous of these is the coconut sambol, made of ground coconut mixed with chili peppers, dried Maldive fish and lime juice. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.\\nQuestion: What other food do they eat?.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Two brothers went to the doctor's office for a medical exam and blood tests. Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels.

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles.

After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described... contains an answer for the question: What are the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses?, what is it ?","target":"Euridice","rationale":"The article mentions the two separate works with identical names (Euridice) that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses.\\nSo, The answer to this question is Euridice"},{"source":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.\\nQuestion: James used the oven  to cook the meat.

There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.\\n\\nQ: did they have red dot sights in ww1?

There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time.

The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets.

Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although   on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\".\\nThere is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit.

This structure is key to keeping your abstract focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image.\\n\\nBACKGROUND Few studies have compared long-term status of bypass grafts between patients with and without diabetes, and uncertainty exists as to whether diabetes independently predicts poor clinical outcome after CABG.   \\n METHODS AND RESULTS Among 1526 patients in BARI who underwent CABG as initial revascularization, 99 of 292 (34%) with treated diabetes mellitus (TDM) (those on insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents) and 469 of 1234 (38%) without TDM had follow-up angiography. Angiograms with the longest interval from initial surgery and before any percutaneous graft intervention (mean 3.9 years) were reviewed. An average of 3.0 grafts were placed at initial CABG for patients with TDM (n=297; internal mammary artery [IMA], 33%) and 2.9 grafts for patients without TDM (n=1347; IMA, 34%). Patients with TDM were more likely than those without to have small (<1.5 mm) grafted distal vessels (29% versus 22%) and vessels of poor quality (9% versus 6%). On follow-up angiography, 89% of IMA grafts were free of stenoses > or =50% among patients with TDM versus 85% among patients without TDM (P=0.23). For vein grafts, the corresponding percentages were 71% versus 75% (P=0.40). After statistical adjustment, TDM was unrelated to having a graft stenosis > or =50% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.32).   \\n CONCLUSIONS Despite diabetic patients' having smaller distal vessels and vessels judged to be of poorer quality, diabetes does not appear to adversely affect patency of IMA or vein grafts over an average of 4-year follow-up. Previously observed differences in survival between CABG-treated patients with and without diabetes may be largely a result of differential risk of mortality from noncardiac causes.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that summarizes the study objectives (\\"BACKGROUND Few studies have compared long-term status of bypass grafts between patients with and without diabetes, and uncertainty exists as to whether diabetes independently predicts poor clinical outcome after CABG.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods (e.g., \\"Among 1526 patients in BARI who underwent CABG as initial revascularization, 99 of 292 (34%) with treated diabetes mellitus (TDM)...\\"), and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusion (\\"CONCLUSIONS Despite diabetic patients' having smaller distal vessels and vessels judged to be of poorer quality, diabetes does not appear to adversely affect patency of IMA or vein grafts over an average of 4-year follow-up.\\").

As the founder of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. Green's songs, such as \\"Albatross\\", \\"Black Magic Woman\\", \\"Oh Well\\", \\"The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)\\" and \\"Man of the World\\", appeared on the record charts, and several have been adapted by a variety of musicians. Green was a major figure in the \\"second great epoch\\" of the British blues movement.\\n\\nOn 27 June 1970, Green appeared at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music with John Mayall, Rod Mayall (organ), Ric Grech (bass) and Aynsley Dunbar (drums). Also soon after leaving Fleetwood Mac, he accompanied former bandmate keyboardist Peter Bardens (Peter B's Looners) on Bardens' solo LP The Answer, playing lead guitar on several tracks. In that same year, he recorded a jam session with drummer Godfrey Maclean, keyboardists Zoot Money and Nick Buck, and bassist Alex Dmochowski of Aynsley Dunbar's Retaliation; Reprise Records released the session as The End of the Game, Peter's first post-Fleetwood Mac solo album. In 1971 he had a brief reunion with Fleetwood Mac, helping them to complete a US tour after guitarist Jeremy Spencer had left the group, performing under the pseudonym Peter Blue. He recorded two tracks for the album Juju with Bobby Tench's band Gass; a solo single and another with Nigel Watson, sessions with B. B. King in London in 1972 and an uncredited appearance on Fleetwood Mac's Penguin LP in 1973, on the song \\"Night Watch\\". Green's mental illness and drug use had become entrenched at this time and he faded into professional obscurity.  In the early 2000s there were rumours of a reunion of the early line-up of Fleetwood Mac, involving Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer. The two guitarists and vocalists were apparently unconvinced of the merits of such a project, but in April 2006, during a question-and-answer session on the Penguin Fleetwood Mac fan website, bassist John McVie said of the reunion idea:  If we could get Peter and Jeremy to do it, I'd probably, maybe, do it.

A month later she tried to break up with me while I thought things were going well.  I drove to her house in the middle of the night to find out what she was so upset about.  Turns out that she was pregnant.  We had only started having sex a couple of weeks prior.  My naive dumb ass asked if it was mine and of course it turns out she's pregnant by one of the biggest losers in school, her ex-boyfriend whom she dumped after realizing what a piece of shit he was.  \\n\\n(Side note, this dude has 4 kids;  my step-daughter, her half-brother (adopted by a new awesome father), a child with down syndrome whom he had with this 40+yo wife who died in a car accident, and another girl who got pregnant and ran to Washington state to get away from him.)\\n\\nI digress.  The entire pregnancy was a nightmare.  The father would stir up drama every chance he got and caused nothing but problems.  Tried to fight me at the NICU she was in for 3 months as she was born 2 months early, started rumors at school, confronted me, etc.  My father-in-law sat us both down and gave us this talk:  \\"Life is about pussy. . .\\" basically made us shake hands and agree to be gentleman.  That didn't last long as he started stalking us.  Also, while it was his weekend with the baby, we would see him at the mall by himself or with friends and no baby.  When asked, of course his parents were watching her.  Fast forward many years of compulsive lying and general neglect, HE CALLS CPS...ON US.  Told his doctor we were putting cigarettes out on her which was in no shape or form true in any way.  She's a \\"picker\\" and had picked some bug bites or whatever and of course when you pick your wounds they look worse.  She still does it today.  We decided after all the drama and all the pain he's caused our beloved daughter that he didn't deserve to see her anymore.  The child support payments stopped immediately.  It's now been 7 years without a single payment, but this isn't about him. \\n\\nMy wife is a type 1 diabetic with multiple complications as a result of her not taking care of herself.  We have struggled to get her on any kind of insurance or coverage that would help her with her diabetes.  While I was in the Army, she had Tricare which was awesome and even left us with 6 months of supplies after the fact which was a life saver.  Her complications go from being like 90% blind (maybe worse, eye appointment upcoming) - can't read the big E on the eye chart to missing toes to nerve damage to diabetic gastroparesis.  We are days apart (age 31) and she's suffering badly.  Now, all that being said, she doesn't check her blood sugar regularly, doesn't take insulin properly, prefers to have a blood sugar &gt;200 as opposed to 100-200 where it's supposed to be because being \\"low\\" feels so much worse than a blood sugar high.  Food?  Psh.  Anything fried or covered in sugar is her favorite.  Donuts, french fries, burgers, anything sweet that isn't chocolate.  I KNOW I don't help.  My diet sucks, I eat fast food constantly and I'm a little overweight and I love the sweets too.  Here's the difference:  I know I eat like shit and I want to change it.  I've made several attempts to change my diet and excersize more only to fail over and over again.  I've managed to stick to a \\"low-carb, high vegetable, low-fat\\" diet for a few weeks at a time, during which she is AWFUL.  Complains constantly, never stops talking about ice cream or gummy bears.  When we were short on time one evening, I said \\"Hey, I'm going to burger king to get a salad...do you want one?\\" - trying to at least nudge her in the general right direction.  'No, get me the triple double bacon with cheese and extra fries with a giant diet coke'.  I've tried this HUNDREDS of times to convince her to eat right.  Here's the thing, she's beautiful, gorgeous and FAR from fat.  I'm not trying to get her to eat right so she'll lose weight, I'm trying to get her to eat right to save her fucking life.  We've accumulated probably over $1,000,000 in hospital bills due to 9-10 emergency room visits a year.  When she gets sick, they usually keep her in the hospital at least a week and the recovery at home can be 2-4 weeks at which point the cycle starts over again where she's getting sick in that timeframe and right back in the hospital with an infection, DKA, gastroparesis symptoms, etc.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe started couples counseling last year but it only lasted a couple of months.  I started therapy and seeing a medications-provider (pyschiatrist) at the same time.  I have VA care so I can use all the healthcare options they have available including couples counseling but it does not include my wife's personal care.  During counseling last year (\\\\~May 2018) our counselor asked to give our relationship 2 more months during counseling.  We did all kinds of \\"homework\\" like remembering how we felt when we were first together and all this emotional stuff, but, I don't think she understood(the therapist).  I LOVE my wife.  Deeply, strongly and faithfully.  I've never been unfaithful and I tell her everything.  She's the only person in the world I can literally be myself around and she won't hate me for it, at least that's how I feel.  But, I don't know if I explained everything right or what, but, my problems with my wife are tangible REAL problems, not emotional ones.  It was always difficult to get her in the mood for sex but now that she's been sick(3 years now), it's stopped pretty much completely.  When it DOES happen, it's awful for both of us.  I know that sex isn't everything so I've looked past that.  I've asked her at least 1,000 times to do any of the following:  A)  Get a job, go to work, do something.  B)  Apply for college, go back to school, get some student loans, etc.  C)  Apply for disability.  If you're too sick to work, then you must be disabled.  With disability and/or a job comes health insurance, with health insurance you can see the doctors you need to see.  With doctors comes the inevitable healthier lifestyle and therefore positive changes in her health.  I gave the counselor the two months she asked for and I thought HARD about my relationship for months, I'm still thinking about it.  That August, I told my wife that I had made my decision and I wanted to separate.  I told her that I wanted our daughter to finish 6th grade before we split up the family.  She just started middle school and is in band for the first time and she's really been struggling to find herself this year.  I love our daughter as much as I love my wife.  I have asked and begged and pleaded my wife not to take her away from me like we did her biological father.  She swears she's going to let me continue being her \\"dad\\" forever.  I have every intention of taking care of her until I'm incapable of doing so.  Here's the dad thing too - we've lost 2 babies to miscarriage and had 1 early pregnancy loss during our 10+year relationship.  I have no biological children and that bothers me a lot.  She knows and we've NEVER used protection, birth control, nor have I ever really pulled out.  We know that we SHOULDN'T have more children because it would endanger her life but she wanted to give me a child and I wanted to give her one.  Fortunately, now, that never happened.  It now appears that we will never conceive a child of our own nor will she ever DO ANYTHING with her life nor will she ever be able to drive herself again nor will she be able to take care of her own daughter by herself.  In the last 2 years she's missed Halloween, Christmas, first period, Thanksgiving...and more that I can't think of, because she was in the hospital.    \\n\\n\\nI don't blame her for being a diabetic, I don't blame her for all of the things that \\"just happened\\" to her.  I DO, however, blame her for her poor choices in taking care of herself.  I DO blame her for NOT CARING ENOUGH about her own life to get herself right for our daughter.  I have a small glimmer of hope, less than 1% chance, that she'll let our daughter stay with me when we separate.  I gave her almost an entire year to figure something out and here we are, 3 months away from the date that was set and she's WORSE now than last year instead of better.    \\n\\n\\nTL;DR:  Type 1 diabetic wife doesn't take care of herself, has serious complications from it, has no intentions of fixing anything or getting healthier and has been quoted as saying \\"I just want to get her to 18\\" (our daughter).  I'm letting her stay with me and I'm still taking care of her until May when we \\"separate\\" - probably followed by divorce.    \\n\\n\\nAITA?!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis is really hard for me to post because I have anxiety really bad and I think everyone is going to be angry at me.

Peak diaphragmatic activity (EMGdi) had a curvilinear relationship with TI during the ventilatory and occlusive phases such that TI shortened as EMGdi decreased during the ventilatory phase (r = 0.87, P less than 0.05) and it prolonged as EMGdi increased during the occlusive phase (r = 0.89, P less than 0.02). However, EMGdi vs. TI for the occlusive phase was shifted to the right of that for the ventilatory phase, reflecting the relatively longer TI during upper airway occlusion. TI also had a linear relationship with pleural pressure (r = 0.94, P less than 0.001) that remained unchanged during the ventilatory and occlusive phases such that it prolonged as negative inspiratory pressure increased. These results indicate that respiratory timing is continuously modified in patients with occlusive apnea as inspiratory neural drive fluctuates during NREM sleep and suggest that this modification is due to the net effects of changing inspiratory neural drive and afferent input predominantly from upper airway mechanoreceptors.","target":"Diaphragm","rationale":"From the abstract, it is clear that the research paper focuses on respiratory timing mechanisms in patients with occlusive apnea and how inspiratory neural drive fluctuates during NREM sleep.

This study describes the willingness to be vaccinated for H1N1 among healthcare workers (HCWs) in primary healthcare clinics with and without chronic medical conditions, their reasons for refusing vaccination and whether they sought additional information to make an informed decision for the vaccination. Materials and methods: An anonymous survey was conducted in November 2009 among all medical, nursing, allied health and operations HCWs in nine primary care clinics in Singapore. Participants were asked if they had any chronic medical conditions associated with influenza-related complications (example: asthma, stroke, heart disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, renal disease), their perception towards vaccination for H1N1 and against seasonal influenza within the preceding 2 years. Results: The initial response rate was 80%, of which 711 (54.7%) of the completed surveys were analysed. Among the 711 respondents, 16.6% reported having at least 1 chronic disease. Asthma (10.8%), hypertension (10.4%) and dyslipidaemia (9.8%) were the main chronic conditions. Only 39.4% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated against H1N1. Males were 2.07 (95% CI 1.19-3.62) times more likely than females to receive the H1N1 vaccination; the 45-54 and 55+ years old were 2.12 (95% CI 1.06-4.24) and 2.44 (95% CI 1.13-5.27) times more willing than those below 25 years old; and those who considered accepting the seasonal influenza vaccine were 7.0 times more likely than those who did not (95%CI 4.48-10.92).The 2 principal barriers were \\"fear of side effects\\" and \\"unsure of vaccine's effectiveness\\". Although 78% attended some H1N1-related talks, only 7% of all HCWs felt that they had sufficient information. Most wanted more information about the vaccine's safety profile and contraindications. Conclusion: Fewer than 40% of HCWs expressed willingness to receive the H1N1 vaccination, lower than past rates of influenza vaccine. HCWs in primary care clinics who had a chronic condition did not perceive themselves to be at higher risk of developing H1N1-related complications and were not more willing than the rest of the HCWs to accept H1N1 vaccination. Vaccine's side effects and effectiveness were the main concerns. Uptake of H1N1 vaccine may improve with targeted health information covering the vaccine's safety profile.","target":"Healthcare workers and H1N1 vaccination: Does having a chronic disease make a difference?","rationale":"The title should provide evidence that the vaccination rate for H1N1 among HCWs with chronic medical conditions is lower than the rest of HCWs, and examines whether this difference is due to variations in disease risk perception or other factors.
