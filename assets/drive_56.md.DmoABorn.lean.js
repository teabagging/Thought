He is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time. Hailed as the best halfback in the world for many years, he captained the Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League and participated in the team's only two premiership victories in 1997 and 2001, playing a club record 249 games for the Knights. Johns also represented his country at two World Cups, and on one Kangaroo tour, playing in total 21 Test matches for the national side.\\n\\nAndrew Johns broke one of the longest-standing records in Round 2 of the 2006 season as he amassed 30 points against the Canberra Raiders and in doing so claimed the points-scoring record for a player at a single club, surpassing Mick Cronin's 1,971 points for Parramatta.  Back in the NRL, playing for Newcastle during a Round 18 match against the Parramatta Eels, Johns' name entered the NRL record books for the second time in the year. A Johns conversion of a Newcastle try made Johns the highest points scorer in the 98-year history of first-grade rugby league in Australia, eclipsing Jason Taylor's previous record of 2,107 points. He rather coincidentally scored the record-breaking conversion in a 46-12 loss to the Eels, who were coached at the time by Jason Taylor.  Things did not start well for Johns in the 2007 season as he lasted only four minutes into Round 1. As Canterbury Bulldogs forward Sonny Bill Williams went to perform one of his trade-mark hits on Johns, the tackle strayed high leaving Johns lying concussed. Williams pleaded guilty at the judiciary to a reckless high tackle, and received a two-week suspension for the hit. Johns missed the following match but returned in Round 3 against the Canberra Raiders--which would be his last career match in the NRL. On the Thursday after the Canberra match, a tackle with Newcastle teammate Adam Woolnough in a training session resulted in his referral to a specialist to examine a neck injury. It was revealed that Johns had a bulging disc in his neck. It was confirmed that this had been present for some time and was not related to the training incident. All medical advice was that Johns should retire from professional football, since any further neck injury could prove life-threatening and on 10 April 2007, Johns announced his retirement from rugby league.  The Newcastle Knights' season would fall apart: they finished 15th of 16 teams on the ladder, narrowly missing out on the Wooden Spoon with a narrow two-point victory in their last match of the season. Johns tried to soften the blow of his retirement by saying he had been seriously considering retirement at the end of the 2007 season and was quoted in the press as saying \\"I knew this year would be my last year, it's just unfortunate it's stopped five months before the end of the season.\\" Commenting on his teammates' reaction to his retirement, Johns noted: \\"They were sort of relieved I think, after a couple of injuries this year ... I think the time's right.\\"  On his retirement a chorus of past league greats called for Johns to be immediately honoured as an immortal of the game. In the preceding 13 years, the former Cessnock junior had changed the game like few others before him. On October 2008 Johns completed a walk from Newcastle to Sydney to raise funds for the Black Dog Institute.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Andrew Johns","rationale":"The context is an account of the life and career of Andrew Johns, as well as his retirement from professional rugby league.

Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village.\\nOne morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought.

Passage:In 1944, Argentia served as one of the two stopover bases for the refuelling, maintenance, and crew changes of the six United States Navy (USN) K-class blimps that made the first transatlantic crossings of non-rigid airships. Blimps K-123 and K-130 from USN Blimp Squadron 14 (also known as ZP-14, Blimpron 14, or \\"The Africa Squadron\\") left South Weymouth Naval Air Station in Massachusetts on 28 May 1944 and landed at Argentia about 16 hours later. The two K-ships then flew for approximately 22 hours to Lages Field on Terceira Island in the Azores, the second stopover base for the transatlantic flights. The last leg was a ~20-hour flight to the squadron's final destination with Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 15 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco (now Kenitra, Morocco). Blimps K-123 and K-130 were followed by K-109 and K-134 then K-112 and K-101 which left South Weymouth on 11 and 27 June, respectively, in 1944. These six blimps initially conducted nighttime anti-submarine warfare operations to complement the daytime missions flown by FAW-15 aircraft (PBYs and PB4Y-2) using magnetic anomaly detection to locate U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar. Later, ZP-14 K-ships conducted minespotting and minesweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escort missions including that of the convoy carrying Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in early 1945. In late April 1945, K-89 and K-114 left NAS Weeksville (now Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City) in North Carolina and flew a southern route to NAS Bermuda, the Azores, and Port Lyautey, where they arrived on 1 May 1945.","target":"a","rationale":"The question requires the user to understand that the two USN airships landed at Argentia as their final destination in 1944.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die.

Anecdotal reports suggest that these adjustments may have negatively affected access to chemotherapy for Medicare beneficiaries.   \\n OBJECTIVE To compare patient wait times and travel distances for chemotherapy before and after the enactment of the MMA.   \\n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Analysis of a nationally representative 5% sample of claims from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the period 2003 through 2006. Patients were Medicare beneficiaries with incident breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, or lymphoma who received chemotherapy in inpatient hospital, institutional outpatient, or physician office settings.   \\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Days from incident diagnosis to first chemotherapy visit and distance traveled for treatment, controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, cancer type, geographic region, comorbid conditions, and year of diagnosis and treatment.   \\n RESULTS There were 5082 incident cases of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, or lymphoma in 2003; 5379 cases in 2004; 5116 cases in 2005; and 5288 cases in 2006. Approximately 70% of patients received treatment in physician office settings in each year. Although the distribution of treatment settings in 2004 and 2005 was not significantly different from 2003 (P = .24 and P = .72, respectively), there was a small but significant change from 2003 to 2006 (P = .02). The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy in inpatient settings decreased from 10.2% in 2003 to 8.8% in 2006 (P = .03), and the proportion in institutional outpatient settings increased from 21.1% to 22.5% (P = .004). The proportion in physician offices remained at 68.7% (P = .29). The median time from diagnosis to initial chemotherapy visit was 28 days in 2003, 27 days in 2004, 29 days in 2005, and 28 days in 2006. In multivariate analyses, average wait times for chemotherapy were 1.96 days longer in 2005 than in 2003 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-3.80 days; P = .04) but not significantly different in 2006 (0.88 days; 95% CI, -0.96 to 2.71 days; P = .35). Median travel distance was 7 miles (11.2 km) in 2003 and 8 miles (12.8 km) in 2004 through 2006. After adjustment, average travel distance remained slightly longer in 2004 (1.47 miles [2.35 km]; 95% CI, 0.87-2.07 miles [1.39-3.31 km]; P < .001), 2005 (1.19 miles [1.90 km]; 95% CI, 0.58-1.80 miles [0.93-2.88 km]; P < .001), and 2006 (1.30 miles [2.08 km]; 95% CI, 0.69-1.90 miles [1.10-3.04 km]; P < .001) compared with 2003.   \\n CONCLUSION There have not been major changes in travel distance and patient wait times for chemotherapy in the Medicare population since 2003, the year before MMA-related changes in reimbursement.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract is structured and includes a topic sentence that explains the context of the study, an objective statement that describes what the researchers are aiming to investigate, a description of the study design and setting and patient population, information about how data were collected during the study period, main outcome measures used to assess changes in wait times for chemotherapy treatment over time, results describing changes in chemotherapy settings before and after MMA implementation as well as travel distance to treatment sites across years of interest, and summary conclusions drawn from these results.

Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.\\n\\n- Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed.

With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress.\\nThe provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.\\n\\n- South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages.

Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes.

The title \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" was borrowed, tongue-in-cheek, from a mnemonic used to remember the musical notes that form the lines of the treble clef: EGBDF. The opening track \\"Procession\\" was the only item composed by all five band members, a fascinating track depicting the \\"evolution\\" of music, leading into Hayward's \\"Story in Your Eyes\\". Thomas's reflective \\"Our Guessing Game\\" and whimsical \\"Nice To Be Here\\" offset the deeper drama of Hayward's \\"You Can Never Go Home\\", Lodge's \\"One More Time To Live\\" and Pinder's \\"My Song\\". Edge, the long-standing drummer-poet, started writing lyrics intended to be sung, rather than verses to be spoken - his \\"After You Came\\" (1971) featured each of the four lead singers taking a vocal section. Then in 1972, Lodge's songs \\"Isn't Life Strange?\\" (No. 13) and \\"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\\" (No. 36) were lifted from Seventh Sojourn as charting UK singles. Sojourn also saw Pinder using the new Chamberlin instrument in place of the mellotron and Edge using an electronic drum kit. Pinder's stirring lament \\"Lost in a Lost World\\" opened this last \\"Core Seven\\" outing, while his sympathetic ode to Timothy Leary \\"When You're a Free Man\\", Thomas's romantic \\"For My Lady\\", and Hayward's serene \\"New Horizons\\" all stood out.  In an interview following the release of Seventh Sojourn, Graeme Edge told Rolling Stone: \\"We've got two Christians, one Mystic, one Pedantic and one Mess, and we all get on a treat.\\"  By this time, other bands were picking up their work. Pinder's songs \\"A Simple Game\\" (1968) and \\"So Deep Within You\\" (1969) were successfully covered by the Four Tops, Pinder winning an Ivor Novello Award for \\"A Simple Game\\", Elkie Brooks later covered Hayward's \\"Nights in White Satin\\". Pinder also appeared on John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" album in 1971, providing additional percussion on \\"I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier (I Don't Want to Die)\\". The 1968 to 1972 album sleeves, plus several solo sets up to Ray Thomas's \\"Hopes, Wishes & Dreams\\" in 1976, were characterised by striking surreal scenic sleeve artwork (mostly gatefold sleeves) by artist Phil Travers.  In late 1972, a re-issue of the five-year-old \\"Nights in White Satin\\" became the Moody Blues' biggest US hit, soaring to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming a certified million-seller; the song had \\"bubbled under\\" the Hot 100 charts on its original release.

Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.\\n\\n- Liverpool City Council is the governing body for the city of Liverpool in Merseyside, England. It consists of 90 councillors, three for each of the city's 30 wards. The council is currently controlled by the Labour Party and is led by Mayor Joe Anderson. It is a constituent council of Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.\\n\\n- Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 . It lies within the United Kingdom's second-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.55 million. Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council.\\n\\n- The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.\\n\\n- Merseyside is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 1.38 million. It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary, and comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, and the city of Liverpool. Merseyside, which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, takes its name from the River Mersey.\\n\\n- Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are an English electronic music band formed in Wirral, Merseyside in 1978. Spawned by earlier group The Id, the outfit was founded by Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals); amid rotating line-ups, Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Malcolm Holmes (drums) are the longest-serving additional members. OMD released their influential debut single, \\"Electricity\\", in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song \\"Enola Gay\\". The band achieved broader recognition via their seminal album \\"Architecture & Morality\\" (1981) and its three singles, all of which were international hits. Steadily resistant to celebrity status, the group earned acclaim for their adventurous recordings, which combined sonic experimentation and atypical subject matter with musical hooks.\\n\\n- A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.\\n\\n- Ian George Brown (born 20 February 1963) is an English musician.

He has worked at the SETI Institute since 1987 where he is a principal investigator and astrophysicist . His main area of study has been the formation and detection of extrasolar planets , but he has also worked on communications theory . In particular he has written on how patterns in animal communication relate to humans with an emphasis on cetaceans . He grew up on a dairy farm in Cambria , California and therefore did n't have much access to information about stars . But by reading books at the local library , Doyle was able to develop his knowledge in astronomy , and eventually obtain his Bachelor 's and Master 's of Science degrees in astronomy from San Diego State University . His first job was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as an imaging engineer , where he was in charge of analysing pictures of Jupiter and Saturn sent from the spacecraft Voyager . He moved to Heidelberg , Germany , to help analyse images of Halley 's Comet . He got his doctorate in Astrophysics at the University of Heidelberg . In May 2005 he appeared on a National Geographic Channel special titled Extraterrestrial . He also appeared in the episode \`\` Will We Survive First Contact '' , of The Science Channel series titled Morgan Freeman 's Through the Wormhole . Doyle is currently seeking to compare dolphin whistles and baby babble in an attempt to make predictions about extraterrestrial communications . He believes that by measuring the complexity of communications for different species on earth , we could get a good indication of how advanced an extraterrestrial signal is . His study determined that babies babble over 800 different sounds with the same amount of frequency as dolphins . As they grow older , those sounds decrease to around 50 and become more repetitious .

They find that dolphins not only understand the meaning of individual   words, but also understand the importance of word order in a sentence.\\nMost animals enjoy playing -- but dolphins seem to like making their games as challenging as possible.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the...\\nBased on the previous passage, Which passenger made an attempt to stop the hijackers? \\nIs \\"Daniel Lewin\\" a correct answer?","target":"Yes","rationale":"According to the passage, Lewin may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him.

The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning.

They are placed in their own kingdom, the Fungus Kingdom. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. These fungi are called molds. However, some fungi exist as single cells. These fungi are called yeasts. You can see examples of different types of fungi in Figure 9.7. For a funny, fast-paced overview of fungi, watch this video: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: For a long time, scientists classified fungi as members of the Plant Kingdom. Fungi share several obvious traits with plants. For example, both fungi and plants lack the ability to move. Both grow in soil, and both have cell walls. Some fungi even look like plants. Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified. The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago. They lived in the water. Fungi colonized the land around the same time as plants. That was probably between 400 and 500 million years ago. After that, fungi became very abundant on land. By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on land. Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older. Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores. A spore is a special reproductive cell. When fungi reproduce asexually, they can spread quickly. This is good when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation by sexual reproduction. This is beneficial when conditions are changing. Variation helps ensure that at least some organisms survive the changing conditions. Figure 9.10 shows how asexual and sexual reproduction occur in fungi. Refer to the figure as you read about each of them below. During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11. Sexual reproduction also occurs in most fungi. It happens when two haploid hyphae mate. During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse. The single fused cell that results is a diploid spore. It is genetically different from both parents. \\n Question: When did the earliest fungi evolve?","target":"600 million years ago","rationale":"The answer is present in the context passage as \\"The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago.\\""},{"source":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. \\n\\nWhen were the scientist's nerve endings near the surface of the skin stimulated less, during experiment A, or during B?\\n\\nA scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure.

He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B.\\n\\nHint: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood.

On 30 August 1917, an eclectic band of political prisoners, common criminals and insubordinate prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, the largest one in the region.

The initial success of the rebels was short-lived.  They managed to control the prison and the town's administrative buildings for six days, but were all expelled on the seventh day by French government reinforcements. According to French reports 107 were killed on the colonial side and fifty-six on the anti-colonial, including Quyen. French forces were not able to pacify the surrounding countryside until six months later. Can reportedly committed suicide in January 1918 to avoid capture.

But anyway my families been campaigning pretty hard to get my dad back in office and, one day, my family holds a raffle for an event, and that morning my mom wakes me up and tells me to wake my girlfriend up to sign a couple raffles on her way out the door. Me being super groggy, thinks why wake my girlfriend? I'll just quickly sign this with MY name and crash back out instead of waking her up. And what do you know, I win the Grand Prize of a signed guitar by my dad lol! It's funny and badass that it's signed by my dad, but my older brother who's actually been working pretty hard on the campaign aswell, texts me saying everyone agrees he should keep it because he's been one of the hardest workers, and I'm thinking 'Fuck that, if they thought that, why don't they just pitch in and grab him one?' And also, i was a little pissed they just gave it away right off the bat without saying anything to me. So they get back, and we're all checkin it out, and I just straight up say it, 'it's my guitar, I won it man.', and he goes 'we already agreed dude' and 'it's not even supposed to be yours, mom said tell *girlfriend* to sign it. It doesn't look good having his son participate in the family raffle, it's for the people.' I understood that last part, but completely spaced it out when I was filling them out that morning. But to be fair, I won it under MY name. He gives it to me kinda pissed. Then I tell my girlfriend, now she says it should be hers and she can give it to her brother who plays guitar. But then again, it was won under MY name. I was just as hopeful as any other raffle and genuinely felt pretty ecstatic to win the GRAND PRIZE. I definitely wasn't gonna give it up that easy.

Furthermore, given that elementary school students are generally anywhere between 11-13 years old (https://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/elementary-school-grades/) at this time frame and middle school students are 12-14 years old (https://www2.edugains.ca/teachersandleadership/resources_for_teachersandleadership/_docs%20PDFs%20Teaching%20Resources%20Growth%20and%20Development/_ElementaryMiddleSchoolSecondaryResources/_middleSchoolStudentDevelopmentOverviewofStudentDevelopmentalCharacteristicsKto12English6Oct2015x1hrpdfeditshortened102615VFfinaldocConvertedfile0b8a85c1d4b0106c5eab7ff8f33af4d6PDFcompressed1309KBpdf), assuming these events occurred during middle school would be reasonable as well since grades have not been mentioned explicitly;

Replicants are designed and built by the Tyrell Corporation, a giant multi-conglomerate headquartered in two pyramid-like towers. The latest version of replicant technology is the Nexus 6 model. Replicants are mostly used as manual laborers in the \\"off world\\" colonies out in space. Because of their advanced nature and tendency towards violence, replicants have been outlawed on Earth. Specialized police units, \\"blade runners,\\" are charged with the difficult task of detecting replicants who come to Earth.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them.\\nIn a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact.\\nMost recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third.\\nThe main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.\\nEating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\\nThe study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%.\\nIn the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

The average of $793,377 per theater stands as the largest ever achieved during a weekend. The wide release followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens.  The digital surround sound of the film led many of those theaters to implement Dolby Laboratories newest sound systems.

You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure .\\n    For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous.\\n    Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300.\\n    A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350.\\n    For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand.

I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band—or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.\\nCobain came up with the song's title when his friend Kathleen Hanna, at the time the lead singer of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill, wrote \\"Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" on his wall. Hanna meant that Cobain smelled like the deodorant Teen Spirit, which his then-girlfriend Tobi Vail wore. Cobain said he was unaware of the deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted it as a revolutionary slogan, as they had been discussing anarchism and punk rock.\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was, along with \\"Come as You Are\\", one of several songs written following Nirvana's first recording sessions with producer Butch Vig in 1990. Cobain began writing it a few weeks before recording Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, in 1991. When he presented the song to his bandmates, it comprised just the main guitar riff  and the chorus vocal melody, which bassist Krist Novoselic dismissed as \\"ridiculous\\". In response, Cobain made the band play the riff for an hour and a half. Eventually, Novoselic began playing the riff more slowly, inspiring drummer Dave Grohl to create the drum beat. As a result, it is the only song on Nevermind to credit all three band members as writers.Prior to the Nevermind recording sessions, the band sent Vig a cassette demo of song rehearsals including \\"Teen Spirit\\". While the sound of the tape was distorted due to the band playing at a loud volume, Vig felt the song had promise.

It was clear that whatever it was was hurt.\\nI was in a bit of a shock and didn't know what to do next. Fortunately it calmed down and tried to hide itself in a corner. I realized it was a sparrow chick . There are a few sparrow nests under the roof of our apartment, and this little fellow must have fallen out and hurt itself. It was also very young, and obviously far from ready to leave the safety of the nest.\\nI ran to the place and found a box. Having read somewhere that one shouldn't touch a baby bird with one's hands, I picked the chick up with a hand towel and put it in the box. I placed the box outside the front door in the hope that the parents would try to feed it. They never came near it and I brought it inside. I placed the box on a table and it slept for about twenty hours. We later learned that it is quite normal for a hurt bird to sleep so much after undergoing such a hurt experience.\\nWhen it finally woke up we carefully examined it for wounds, but fortunately there wasn't any. It had hurt its right wing and leg, which meant it must have landed on its right side when it fell out of the nest. We named it Lopsy.\\nAfter doing some research we felt there was a chance that it might survive, but we weren't sure that it would ever be able to fly.

The movement was given a doctrine by the architect and architectural theorist Robert Venturi in his 1966 book \\"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture\\". The style flourished from the 1980s through the 1990s, particularly in the work of Venturi, Philip Johnson, Charles Moore and Michael Graves. In the late 1990s it divided into a multitude of new tendencies, including high-tech architecture, neo-classicism and deconstructivism. \\n\\n- The Glass House or Johnson house, is a historic house museum at 798-856 Ponus Ridge Road in New Canaan, Connecticut.

While Dio claims that both the purpose-built naumachia of Augustus and the amphitheatre itself were flooded for two separate shows, Suetonius states only that the event took place on the old artificial lake (which would have been that of Augustus). Martial does not specify where the naumachiae took place, but he is clear that whatever location he is discussing could be flooded and drained at will:\\nIf you are here from a distant land, a late spectator for whom this was the first day of the sacred show, let not the naval warfare deceive you with its ships, and the water like to a sea: here but lately was land.

Suetonius writes that Titus' brother and successor, Domitian, staged sea-fights in the amphitheatre, but he had made alterations to the structure, which probably included adding the hypogeum—a complex of underground passages that may have allowed the arena to be quickly flooded and emptied. While Suetonius only records that Titus' recreations of naval battles took place, Dio gives some details:\\nFor Titus suddenly filled this same theatre with water and brought in horses and bulls and some other domesticated animals that had been taught to behave in the liquid element just as on land. He also brought in people on ships, who engaged in a sea-fight there, impersonating the Corcyreans and Corinthians; and others gave a similar exhibition outside the city in the grove of Gaius and Lucius, a place which Augustus had once excavated for this very purpose.\\n\\nGuess a valid title for it!","target":"Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre","rationale":"The context is about training captured animals to fight each other in the amphitheater. \\nDio and Suetonius state that naval battles were staged there, but Martial says they could not have been held in this location because it was difficult to flood the arena.

These findings were confirmed after controlling for phylogeny using a method of independent contrasts. Transient and/or young birds were an important feature of the Trinidad data, and studies that fail to allow for the presence of such birds risk underestimating adult survival.

The band was founded by J Mascis (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), Lou Barlow (bass, vocals), and Murph (drums). After three albums on independent labels earned the band a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock, creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who later formed Sebadoh and Folk Implosion. His replacement, Mike Johnson came aboard for three major-label albums.\\n\\nDinosaur recorded much of their second album You're Living All Over Me with Sonic Youth engineer Wharton Tiers in New York. During the recording process, tension emerged between Mascis and Murph because Mascis had very specific ideas for the drum parts. Barlow recalled, \\"J controlled Murph's every drumbeat...And Murph could not handle that. Murph wanted to kill J for the longest time.\\" Gerard Cosloy was excited by the completed album, but was devastated when Mascis told him the band was going to release it on California-based SST Records. Mascis was reluctant to sign a two-album deal with Homestead, but Cosloy felt betrayed, \\"There was no way I couldn't take it personally.\\" After the album's completion Mascis moved to New York, leaving the rest of the band feeling alienated.  You're Living All Over Me was released in 1987; early copies of the record in the Boston area were packaged with the Weed Forestin' tape, the first release by Barlow's side project Sebadoh. The album received much more attention in the indie-rock community than the debut. While the previous record had featured different musical styles for each song, You're Living All Over Me found the band's various disparate influences merging into each individual song. Although the hardcore punk influences were noticeably more muted than on Dinosaur, the overall sound was much more powerful, with the instruments often recorded very loud and with considerable distortion. While Mascis's guitar, alternating between Black Sabbath-like riffs, squalling solos, dissonant noise-rock and occasional quiet passages, was the main attraction, Barlow's bass, melodic, highly distorted and often playing thick two-note chords, competed for attention. Meanwhile, Murph played the Mascis-composed drum parts in a very heavy and powerful fashion, resulting in a version of the power trio format. Mascis did most of the lead singing, in a detached drawl that presented a contrast with the extreme music. The songs were highly melodic, albeit with odd song structures that avoided the typical verse-chorus-verse patterns of most rock and pop songs. Barlow also composed two songs: the hardcore-influenced \\"Lose\\" and an acoustic sonic collage entitled \\"Poledo\\" that anticipated his work with Sebadoh.

Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\".\\nIsberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing \\"creative differences\\".Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth.

The hotel is right on the edge of this district, and so we thought we had made a big mistake to book a hotel in such a bad neighborhood. (We didn't know anything about this when we booked.) To give the hotel credit, the rooms were a decent size and very clean. The walls, however, are very thin, and we had a situation in the middle of the night where the people next door kept us awake just by talking. The service is excellent. The hotel staff at the reception could not have been more helpful. As we had not paid a very high price for this hotel, we learned once again that you get what you pay for. I think in hindsight that we should have booked a more expensive hotel and done more research on the location of the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to a friend only because of its location.

Active since 1948, in seventy years of his artistic career Jodorowsky has experienced it in almost all creative forms: writer (in his five facets: novelist, storyteller, poet, playwright and essayist), film director and producer, actor of cinema and theatre, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, comics writer, musician, soundtrack composer, philosopher, puppeteer, mime, psychologist and psychoanalyst, draughtsman, painter, eventually sculptor and spiritual guru. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \\"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\\" for his work which \\"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\\". Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry.\\n\\nJodorowsky spent almost a decade reconstructing the original form of the Tarot de Marseille. From this work he moved into more therapeutic work in three areas: psychomagic, psychogenealogy and initiatic massage. Psychomagic aims to heal psychological wounds suffered in life. This therapy is based on the belief that the performance of certain acts can directly act upon the unconscious mind, releasing it from a series of traumas, some of which practitioners of the therapy believe are passed down from generation to generation. Psychogenealogy includes the studying of the patient's personality and family tree in order to best address their specific sources. It is similar, in its phenomenological approach to genealogy, to the Constellations pioneered by Bert Hellinger.  Jodorowsky has several books on his therapeutic methods, including Psicomagia: La trampa sagrada (Psychomagic: The Sacred Trap) and his autobiography, La danza de la realidad (The Dance of Reality), which he was filming as a feature-length film in March 2012. To date he has published more than 23 novels and philosophical treatises, along with dozens of articles and interviews. His books are widely read in Spanish and French, but are for the most part unknown to English-speaking audiences.  Throughout his career, Jodorowsky has gained a reputation as a philosopher and scholar who presents the teachings of religion, psychology, and spiritual masters, by molding them into imaginative endeavors. All of his enterprises integrate an artistic approach. Currently, Jodorowsky dedicates much of his time to lecturing about his work.  For a quarter of a century, Jodorowsky held classes and lectures for free, in cafes and universities all over the city of Paris. Typically, such courses or talks would begin on Wednesday evenings as tarot divination lessons, and would culminate in an hour long conference, also free, where at times hundreds of attendees would be treated to live demonstrations of a psychological \\"arbre genealogique\\" (\\"tree of genealogy\\") involving volunteers from the audience. In these conferences, Jodorowsky would pave the way to building a strong base of students of his philosophy, which deals with understanding the unconscious as the \\"over-self\\", composed of many generations of family relatives, living or deceased, acting on the psyche, well into adult lives, and causing compulsions. Of all his work, Jodorowsky considers these activities to be the most important of his life. Though such activities only take place in the insular world of Parisian cafes, he has devoted thousands of hours of his life to teaching and helping people \\"become more conscious,\\" as he puts it.  Since 2011 these talks have dwindled to once a month and take place at the \\"Librairie Les Cent Ciels\\" in Paris.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","rationale":"The answer to this question is Alejandro Jodorowsky.

Bob, on the other hand was hypotensive.\\n\\nWhich brother had a smaller chance of having a stroke?\\n\\nHint: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.","target":"Bob","rationale":"The context of the passage states that Bill has hypertension, which is a condition where there are high blood pressure levels.

He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket--a world record at the time of his retirement--at an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket.\\nContext: Trumble was born in the inner Melbourne neighbourhood of Collingwood, Victoria in 1867, the son of William, born in Northern Ireland and superintendent of an insane asylum, and Scottish-born Elizabeth (nee Clark). His elder brother, John, also played Test cricket for Australia and his younger brother, Thomas, was a public servant who served as Secretary for the Department of Defence from 1918-27, and then official secretary to the High Commissioner for Australia in London.  Trumble spent part of his early life in the western Victorian town of Ararat before returning to Melbourne, settling in suburban Camberwell. He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club. Encouraging his sons' early love of cricket, William Trumble--a keen cricketer who bowled leg breaks for South Melbourne Cricket Club--set out a cricket pitch at the family home. He placed a feather on a good length and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling. Known for his accuracy, Hugh later said, \\"Of course I couldn't repeatedly hit the feather, but I soon reached the stage when I was always pretty close to it\\"  Trumble transferred to the Melbourne Cricket Club for the 1887-88 cricket season and was an immediate success. He took 36 wickets that season, finishing with an average of 6.77 runs per wicket; the best in the club, beating his teammate and Australian Test bowler Fred Spofforth. He made his first-class cricket debut for Victoria that same season, selected to play against a touring English XI led by Middlesex batsman George Vernon.

He became the pretender to the former thrones, Head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1922, upon the death of his father.

German spelling, until the German orthography reform of 1996, was Anschluß and it was also known as the Anschluss Österreichs.\\nThe idea of an \\"Anschluss\\" (Austria and Germany united to form a \\"Greater Germany\\") began after the Unification of Germany excluded Austria and the Austrian Germans from the Prussian-dominated German nation-state in 1871. Following the end of World War I, in 1918, the Republic of German-Austria attempted union with Germany, but the Treaty of Saint Germain (10 September 1919) and the Treaty of Versailles (28 June 1919) forbade both the union and the continued use of the name \\"German-Austria\\" (\\"Deutschösterreich\\").\\n\\n- Operation Valkyrie was a German World War II emergency continuity of government operations plan issued to the Territorial Reserve Army of Germany to execute and implement in case of a general breakdown in civil order of the nation. Failure of the government to maintain control of civil affairs might have been caused by the Allied bombing of German cities, or uprising of the millions of foreign forced laborers working in German factories.\\n\\n- Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.\\n\\n- The Austrian Resistance to Nazi rule was launched in response to the Anschluss in 1938. The members of the Resistance, limited primarily to adherents of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty and the political left, operated in isolation from the Austrian mainstream during the war years. Other strands of Austrian resistance included Catholics and monarchists. However, it is notable that several Austrian nationalists, some of them even with fascist sympathies, also resisted, opposed to the destruction of the Austrian state. The most prominent unifying symbol was former Crown Prince, Otto von Habsburg.\\n\\n- The Kriegsmarine (\\"War Navy\\") was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It superseded the \\"Kaiserliche Marine\\" (German Imperial Navy) of World War I and the inter-war \\"Reichsmarine\\". The \\"Kriegsmarine\\" was one of three official branchesalong with the \\"Heer (Army)\\" and the \\"Luftwaffe (Air Force)\\"of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany.\\n\\n- On 20 July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg and other conspirators attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Führer of Nazi Germany, inside his Wolf's Lair field headquarters near Rastenburg, East Prussia. The name Operation Valkyrie, originally referring to part of the conspiracy, has become associated with the entire event. The apparent purpose of the assassination attempt was to seize political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party (including the SS) and to make peace with the western Allies as soon as possible. The underlying desire of many of the involved high-ranking Wehrmacht officers was apparently to show to the world that not all Germans were like Hitler and the Nazi Party. The details of the conspirators' peace initiatives remain unknown, but they likely would have included demands to accept wide-reaching territorial annexations by Germany in Europe.\\n\\n- The Treaty of Versailles was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919.\\n\\n- Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (15 November 1907  21 July 1944) was a German army officer and member of the German nobility who was one of the leading members of the failed 20 July plot of 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler and remove the Nazi Party from power. Along with Henning von Tresckow and Hans Oster, he was one of the central figures of the German Resistance movement within the \\"Wehrmacht\\". For his involvement in the movement, he was executed by firing squad shortly after the failed attempt known as Operation \\"Valkyrie\\".\\n\\n- The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. \\n\\n- The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.\\n\\n- Wolf's Lair (German: \\"Wolfsschanze\\"; Polish: \\"Wilczy Szaniec\\") was Adolf Hitler's first Eastern Front military headquarters in World War II. The complex, which would become one of several \\"Führerhauptquartiere\\" (Führer Headquarters) located in various parts of occupied Europe, was built for the start of Operation \\"Barbarossa\\"  the invasion of the Soviet Union  in 1941. It was constructed by Organisation Todt.\\n\\n- Führer (spelled Fuehrer when the umlaut is not available) is a German word meaning \\"leader\\" or \\"guide\\". As a political title it is most associated with the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler was the only person to hold the position of Führer. The word Führer in the sense of \\"guide\\" remains common in German, and it is used in numerous compound words. However, because of its strong association with Nazi Germany, the isolated word may come with some stigma and negative connotations when used with the meaning of \\"leader\\", especially in political contexts. The word \\"Führer\\" has cognates in the Scandinavian languages, spelled \\"fører\\" which have the same meaning and use as the German word, but without political connotations.\\n\\n- Carl Szokoll ( 15 October 1915 -- 25 August 2004 ) was an Austrian resistance fighter involved in the 20 July Plot , major in the Wehrmacht , and , after the war , author and film producer .\\n\\n- The Reichswehr (English: Imperial Defence) formed the military organisation of Germany from 1919 until 1935, when it was united with the new \\"Wehrmacht\\" (Defence Force).\\n\\n- The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.\\n\\n- Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.\\n\\n- Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.\\n\\n- An army (from Latin \\"arma\\" \\"arms, weapons\\" via Old French \\"armée\\", \\"armed\\" (feminine)) or ground force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land.

The simplest answer to the question of how long does it take for nicotine to leave your system is a few weeks. Once nicotine consumption is stopped, nicotine levels in the blood begin to gradually decrease. Nicotine has a half-life in the human body of 2 hours (although it can range from 1 to 4 hours in different individuals). The average smoker has a blood nicotine concentration of about 40 ng/ml after an evening cigarette. And usually when signing up for life insurance they will ASK you if you've smoked in the last 12 months, but the testing is not that thorough, its the same nicotine test no matter what, they dont take your hair or anything, its a simple blood test. Ive heard it takes 30 days but not 100% sure. Nicotine has been shown to be an even more addictive drug than others such as heroine! The lingering presence of nicotine in the body acts as a reminder for nicotine consumption. It is popularly believed that nicotine is released from the human body within 72 hours of its consumption, but the truth is far different. The various aspects of nicotine storage in the body last for weeks after the most recent consumption of nicotine. Many people wonder about how long nicotine stays in your blood. Blood harbors both nicotine and metabolites released by nicotine. I recently got hired for a job and had to undergo cotinine testing, however because I drank a lot of water, the lab requested a second test due to dilution. Before my first testing, I had been smoke free for 3 days. I took the test, then ignorantly lit a cigarette, it tasted awful.. I probably took 2 or 3 puffs off of it before throwing it out. Sorry to split hairs on this, but given that the typical half-life of nicotine is 2 hours, and that most assays have a limit of detection of 0.1 to 0.5 ng/ml, following the logic I described above, all the nicotine has gone from the blood stream within 24 hours. i.e. when you take a blood sample from a smoker 24 hours after their last smoke, they will most likely have a blood nicotine level <0.5 ng/ml. (i.e.>95% gone by 24 hrs). She's more concerned with how long it takes nicotine and what I would call, by products, from leaving her body, than she is as to why the doctor has asked her to quit smoking. She even said the doctor told her he wanted the nicotine out for 30 days so the surgery would be successful. How long can nicotine be detected in blood or urine after quiting smoking? [Top] The byproducts of nicotine can be detected in the blood for up to a month after you stop smoking. This is only of concern if you are in a situation where someone else might want to test you for the presence of nicotine or nicotine byproducts in your system. However, the metabolite of nicotine which is known as Cotinine leaves its traces in blood as well as in urine for up to 7 days. About 85 to 90 per cent of the nicotine which is present in your blood is metabolised by the liver and is thrown out of your system by the kidney. But due to the higher concentration, many a times, it still persists in the blood stream. Nicotine is a very highly addictive chemical that is the main component of cigarettes. Your body, especially your heart and lungs, will usually begin to heal at 12 hours after you’ve had your last cigarette/ stopped smoking. Finally, as nicotine levels in the blood keep decreasing over the coming weeks, the nicotine stored by various tissues in the body recedes to significantly lower levels. Patients with surgical procedures planned are often advised to quit smoking weeks before surgery so that healing can be improved.

Previously the vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25[OH]2D3) was found to be inappropriately low in SHR in view of their ionized hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. We examined the responses of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 to several known stimuli. Baseline plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels tended to be lower in SHR than WKY rats (51.5 +/- 4.3 vs. 82.3 +/- 14.1 pg/ml, P = 0.06). Infusion of a pharmacologic dose of parathyroid hormone (8 U/hr over a period of 17 hours) resulted in a plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 504 +/- 77 pg/ml in SHR vs. 1016 +/- 211 pg/ml in WKY rats (P less than 0.03). Cyclic adenosine monophosphate infusion (1 mumol/hr/100 gm over a period of 17 hours) in thyroparathyroidectomized animals resulted in a 1,25(OH)2D3 level of 121 +/- 24 pg/ml in SHR vs. 557 +/- 26 pg/ml in WKY rats (P less than 0.01). After dietary phosphorus depletion for 3 weeks, SHR also had lower 1,25(OH)2D3 levels than WKY rats (83 +/- 13 vs. 300 +/- 42 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) even though a comparable degree of hypophosphatemia was achieved. Thus, the response of plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels to several known stimuli is submaximal in SHR as compared with WKY rats, suggesting defective synthesis or enhanced metabolic clearance of this hormone. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides numerical values for the mean plasma levels of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in SHR and WKY rats at baseline and after infusion of parathyroid hormone, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), or phosphorus depletion. These values are used to show that the response of plasma 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels to several known stimuli is submaximal in SHR as compared with WKY rats.

The band got its name, at Morrison's suggestion from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, which itself was a reference to a quote made by William Blake, \\"If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.\\" They were unique and among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973.\\n\\nDespite Morrison's conviction and the fallout from their appearance in New Orleans, The Doors set out to reclaim their status as a premier act with L.A. Woman in 1971. The album included rhythm guitarist Marc Benno on several tracks and prominently featured bassist Jerry Scheff, best known for his work in Elvis Presley's TCB Band. Despite a comparatively low Billboard chart peak at #9, L.A. Woman contained two Top 20 hits and went on to be their second best-selling studio album, surpassed in sales only by their debut. The album explored their R&B roots, although during rehearsals they had a falling-out with Paul Rothchild, who was dissatisfied with the band's effort. Denouncing \\"Love Her Madly\\" as \\"cocktail lounge music\\", he quit and handed the production to Bruce Botnick and the Doors.  The title track and two singles (\\"Love Her Madly\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm\\") remain mainstays of rock radio programming, with the last of these being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its special significance to recorded music. In the song \\"L.A. Woman\\", Jim Morrison scrambles the letters of his own name to chant \\"Mr. Mojo Risin\\".

Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. \\nWhat will the Orion allow NASA to do and why? \\nI was going to say \\"It will allow NASA to travel into deep space, because it is loaded with superlatives\\".

Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutual unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the dialect continuum being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely Eastern Lombard, a language in Northern Italy's Lombardy region that includes the Bergamasque dialect, would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely standard Italian speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure Sicilian language variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan, Catalan, or French speaker than a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have an greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related Neapolitan language, but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking Sicilian Gallo-Italic, a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the same island as the Sicilian language.","target":"geographical distance or geographical barriers","rationale":"The context mentions the mutual unintelligibility of regional Italian languages.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die.

In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual.

A tune named \\"Arlington\\" accompanied Newton's verses as much as \\"New Britain\\" for a time in the late 19th century.\\nTwo musical arrangers named Dwight Moody and Ira Sankey heralded another religious revival in the cities of the U.S. and Europe, giving the song international exposure. Moody's preaching and Sankey's musical gifts were significant; their arrangements were the forerunners of gospel music, and churches all over the U.S. were eager to acquire them. Moody and Sankey began publishing their compositions in 1875, and \\"Amazing Grace\\" appeared three times with three different melodies, but they were the first to give it its title; hymns were typically published using the first line of the lyrics, or the name of the tune such as \\"New Britain\\". A publisher named Edwin Othello Excell gave the version of \\"Amazing Grace\\" set to \\"New Britain\\" immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches. Excell altered some of Walker's music, making it more contemporary and European, giving \\"New Britain\\" some distance from its rural folk-music origins. Excell's version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs. Several editions featuring Newton's first three stanzas and the verse previously included by Harriet Beecher Stowe in Uncle Tom's Cabin were published by Excell between 1900 and 1910, and his version of \\"Amazing Grace\\" became the standard form of the song in American churches.","target":"Ira","rationale":"The context says that Ira Sankey was one of the two arrangers who helped to popularize the song.

But the earth goes through temperature cycles over much longer periods than those that we experience. Between 65,000 and 35,000 years ago, the planet was much colder than it is now. During that time the temperature also changed a lot, with periods of warming and cooling. Ice melted during the warm periods, which made sea levels rise. Water froze again during the cold periods.\\nA new study from Switzerland, sheds light on where ice sheets melted during the ice age. It now seems that the ice melted at both ends of the earth, rather than just in either northern or southern regions.\\nThis surprised the researchers from the University of Bern. Scientists have long assumed that most of the ice that melted was in the Northern hemisphere  during the 30,000-year long ice age. That belief was held because the North Pole is surrounded by land, while the South Pole is surrounded by the Antarctic Ocean. It is easier for ice sheets to grow on land. If surrounded by sea the ice can easily just slip into the ocean instead of building up.\\nThe researchers used a computer model to look at ways the ice could melt and how it might affect sea levels. They compared these results to evidence of how temperatures and currents actually changed during that time. The model showed that if it was only in the Northern hemisphere that ice melted, there would have been a bigger impact  on ocean currents  and sea temperatures than what actually happened. Studies suggest that melting just in the Southern hemisphere would have been impossible, too.

Induction cooktops are powered by electricity, but the “element” that rests beneath the ceramic or glass surface functions like a powerful magnet, which generates a magnetic field. Advantages of induction cooktops. Photo: Gas burners are easy to control, but waste energy by heating the surrounding air and the cooktop as well as the food in the pan. Since they're naked flames, they're more likely to cause a fire than any electric method of cooking. By changing mechanical energy into electrical energy, the generator relied upon the basic principle of electromagnetic induction, that of passing an electrical conductor through a magnetic field. As previously explained, when one side of a coil passes through the magnetic field, first in one direction and then in the other direction, an alternating current (magnetic flux) is the end result. We'll also lift the lid on what you should know before buying, installing or working with induction cooktops. Before we get to that, let's take a look at the benefits of induction cooktops and the surprisingly simple physics of electromagnetic induction. Photo: Ordinary electric charging: all the components of the transformer are contained inside the charger. How induction chargers work. So far so good—but what happens with something like an electric toothbrush, which has no power lead to plug into the wall? This induction charging process can be used to charge a pair of pop cans. It is a simple enough experiment to be repeated at home. Two pop cans are mounted on Styrofoam cups using scotch tape. Induction and Electromagnetism Understanding electromagnetic induction. Motors, transformers, audio speakers, radio transmission and generators work using the wild and complex phenomena of electromagnetism. Understanding the behavior of electromagnetism is a large subject of study. What is electrical induction? Electrical induction is also called magnetic induction. It is the ‘voltage’ produced in a conductor due to its reaction with a magnetic field. Health and safety: Pacemakers But the main issue is with which cookware you can use with them. Because of the way they work, many types of pans just don't heat up with induction cooktops. If you have copper bottom, glass or aluminum pans, they don't get hot when you put them on an induction cooktop. How they work METAL OR PLASTIC. First, induction heating works directly only with conductive materials, normally metals. Plastics and other non-conductive materials can often be heated indirectly by first heating a conductive metal susceptor which transfers heat to the non-conductive material.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains.

However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom.

The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet Amyntas III eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for Perdiccas III (r. 368 – 359 BC), younger brother of Alexander II, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365 BC. The remainder of Perdiccas III's reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery.

It occurs when two surfaces rub against each other, creating resistance to movement and slowing down the object in contact with the surface. The source of friction on metal car roofs are usually caused by dust or dirt particles and water buildup from rainstorms – all factors which can be removed easily. On the other hand, sand contains tiny rocks and pebbles (and sometimes shells) as well as minute amounts of moisture from tide pools nearby – these combine together to create more friction than smooth metal would have on an object rolling across it.\\nSo based on this evidence we conclude that there’s less friction between a volleyball and a clean metal roof compared to the same ball being rolled along gritty sandy beach, therefore making A - “metal car roof\\""},{"source":"After spending years searching for a planet with life, scientists may have found one.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days.

They lived in an area that now includes western Indiana and Ohio , and were closely allied with the Wea Indians .

The Piankashaw were living along the Vermilion river in 1743 . The Piankeshaw are usually regarded as being \`\` friendly '' towards European settlers . They intermarried with French traders and were treated as equals by residents of New France in the Illinois Country . A principal Piankeshaw village was established on the Wabash River near what became Vincennes . In fact , some have suggested that the land around the Grand Rapids Hotel that existed in the 1920s was part of a Piankeshaw Summer campground . Like their French neighbors , the Piankeshaw generally sided with the Americans during the American Revolution . Although part of the Wabash Confederacy , the Piankeshaw nation took no part in the Northwest Indian War that followed the American Revolution . However , Piankeshaw suffered retaliation from Americans for attacks made by other native tribes . President George Washington issued a proclamation forbidding harm to the Piankeshaw . During the late 18th century , the Piankeshaw population began to decline . Many of the Piankeshaw simply left and joined other Miami tribes . After the Americans and French suffered setbacks in the Revolution , notably the disastrous LaBalme expedition , some Piankeshaw joined tribes aligned with the British . At that time , in the West , the British looked as if they would be the victors .

Plans were formed for building a great network of railways, partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack. The existence of serfdom was tackled boldly, taking advantage of a petition presented by the Polish landed proprietors of the Lithuanian provinces and, hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees \\"for ameliorating the condition of the peasants,\\" and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected. This step had been followed by one even more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia (serfdom was rare in other parts), containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the Governor-General of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed. The emancipation was not merely a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ukase. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation.

She is stuck between two cars but needs to get to the off ramp and decides to speed up. She hits the gas making her car go faster so she can get ahead of the two cars she is stuck in between and makes it to the ramp in time.\\n\\nHint: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.","target":"slower","rationale":"The context of the situation is that Angela decides to get off her current path, which requires speeding up. However she then changes course by hitting the gas and making her car go faster in order to be able to exit onto a ramp. The change in direction here represents deceleration, when speed decreases while direction remains unchanged.\\nSo the answer must be slower because acceleration is defined as an increase in velocity (or motion) so it should not have been possible for Angela's car to accelerate if she hit the brakes or slowed down since that would represent a decrease in velocity instead of an increase/acceleration (which means her car will now move at a slower pace)."},{"source":"Adverse drug reactions are appreciably harmful or unpleasant reactions resulting from an intervention related to the use of medical products, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product.

How far do you walk to get water? Four miles? One mile? Or is it just a few steps to the faucet? Every day in developing countries, women and children walk an average of 4 miles to collect water for their family. Not only is this chore keeping the children from attending school, but the dirty water they are bringing home is also killing them at an alarming rate! The 2013 Walk will be telling decision makers to keep their promises on water and sanitation. Events take place between March 16 and 24. Find out how you can get involved and add your voice. We also think that good old-fashioned face-to-face conversations work! Let people know that even the smallest gift can make an impact.

How far do you walk for water? For many of us, clean water is within easy reach. A quick stroll to the office water cooler, refill the bottle and then back to work. In developing countries, many women and children start their day by walking an average distance of 6 kilometres to collect water for their families. This consumes 200 million daily work hours, a loss of productivity greater than the combined hours worked in a week by employees at six of the biggest multinational corporations including Walmart, McDonald's, and IBM.

Passage:With the ascendance of Simeon I to the throne in 893, the long-lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end. A conflict arose when Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise, acting under pressure from his wife Zoe Zaoutzaina and her father, Stylianos Zaoutzes, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. Forced to take action, in the autumn of 894 Simeon invaded the Byzantine Empire from the north, meeting little opposition due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern Anatolia to counter Arab invasions. Informed of the Bulgarian offensive, the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon, but his troops were routed somewhere in the theme of Macedonia.The Magyars managed to defeat Simeon's army twice, but in 896 they were routed in the Battle of Southern Buh. The war ended in 896 with a great Bulgarian victory near Bulgarophygon in Eastern Thrace. The market was returned to Constantinople, and the Byzantine Emperor had to pay annual tribute to Bulgaria. More importantly, with help from the Pechenegs Simeon successfully fended off a Magyar invasion, which was coordinated with the Byzantines.\\n Links: a. Battle of Boulgarophygon b. Zoe Zaoutzaina c.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man.

Bimala Prasad was born in 1874 in Puri (Orissa) a son of Kedarnath Datta Bhaktivinoda Thakur, a recognised Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava philosopher and teacher. Bimala Prasad received both Western and traditional Indian education and gradually established himself as a leading intellectual among the bhadralok (Western-educated and often Hindu Bengali residents of colonial Calcutta), earning the title Siddhanta Sarasvati (\\"the pinnacle of wisdom\\"). Under the direction of his father and spiritual preceptor, Bimala Prasad took initiation (diksha) into Gaudiya Vaishnavism from the Vaishnava ascetic Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji, receiving the name Shri Varshabhanavi-devi-dayita Dasa (Sri Varsabhanavi-devi-dayita Dasa, \\"servant of Krishna, the beloved of Radha\\"), and dedicated himself to arduous ascetic discipline, recitation of the Hare Krishna mantra on beads (japa), and study of classical Vaishnava literature.\\n\\nYoung Bimala Prasad, often affectionately called Bimala, Bimu or Binu, started his formal education at an English school at Ranaghat. In 1881 he was transferred to the Oriental Seminary of Calcutta and in 1883, after Kedarnath was posted as senior deputy magistrate in Serampore of Hooghly, Bimala Prasad was enrolled in the local school there. At the age of nine he memorised the seven hundred verses of the Bhagavad Gita in Sanskrit. From his early childhood Bimala Prasad demonstrated a sense of strict moral behaviour, a sharp intelligence, and an eidetic memory. He gained a reputation for remembering passages from a book on a single reading, and soon learned enough to compose his own poetry in Sanskrit. His biographers stated that even up to his last days Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati could verbatim recall passages from books that he had read in his childhood, earning the epithet \\"living encyclopedia\\".  In the early 1880s, Kedarnath Datta, out of desire to foster the child's budding interest in spirituality, initiated him into harinama-japa, a traditional Gaudiya Vaishnava practice of meditation based on the soft recitation of the Hare Krishna mantra on tulasi beads.  In 1885 Kedarnath Datta established the Vishva Vaishnava Raj Sabha (Royal World Vaisnava Association); the association composed of leading Bengali Vaishnavas stimulated Bimala's intellectual and spiritual growth and inspired him to undertake an in-depth study of Vaishnava texts, both classical and contemporary. Bimala's interest in the Vaishnava philosophy was further fuelled by the Vaishnava Depository, a library and a printing press established by Kedarnath Datta (by that time respectfully addressed as Bhaktivinoda Thakur) at his own house for systematically presenting Gaudiya Vaishnavism. In 1886 Bhaktivinoda began publishing a monthly magazine in Bengali, Sajjana-toshani (\\"The source of pleasure for devotees\\"), where he published his own writings of the history and philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, along with book reviews, poetry, and novels. Twelve-year-old Bimala Prasad assisted his father as a proofreader, thus closely acquainting himself with the art of printing and publishing as well as with the intellectual discourses of the bhadralok.  In 1887 Bimala Prasad joined the Calcutta Metropolitan Institution (from 1917 - Vidyasagar College), which provided substantial modern education to the bhadralok youth; there, while studying the compulsory subjects, he pursued extracurricular studies of Sanskrit, mathematics, and jyotisha (traditional Indian astronomy).

Thompson had English and distant Dutch ancestry. He attended public school in Lawrenceburg, graduating from Lawrence County High School, where he played high-school football. Thereafter, he worked days in the local post office, and nights at the Murray bicycle assembly plant.\\n\\nIn 1973, Thompson was appointed minority counsel to assist the Republican senators on the Senate Watergate Committee, a special committee convened by the U.S. Senate to investigate the Watergate scandal. Thompson was sometimes credited for supplying Republican Senator Howard Baker's famous question, \\"What did the President know, and when did he know it?\\" This question is said to have helped frame the hearings in a way that eventually led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon.  A Republican staff member, Donald Sanders, found out about the White House tapes and informed the committee on July 13, 1973. Thompson was informed of the existence of the tapes, and he, in turn, informed Nixon's attorney, J. Fred Buzhardt. \\"Even though I had no authority to act for the committee, I decided to call Fred Buzhardt at home,\\" Thompson later wrote, \\"I wanted to be sure that the White House was fully aware of what was to be disclosed so that it could take appropriate action.\\"  Three days after Sanders's discovery, at a public, televised committee hearing, Thompson asked former White House aide Alexander Butterfield the famous question, \\"Mr. Butterfield, were you aware of the existence of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the President?\\" thereby publicly revealing the existence of tape recordings of conversations within the White House. National Public Radio later called that session and the discovery of the Watergate tapes \\"a turning point in the investigation.\\"  Thompson's appointment as minority counsel to the Senate Watergate committee reportedly upset Nixon, who believed Thompson was not skilled enough to interrogate unfriendly witnesses and would be outfoxed by the committee Democrats. According to historian Stanley Kutler, however, Thompson and Baker \\"carried water for the White House, but I have to give them credit--they were watching out for their interests, too... They weren't going to mindlessly go down the tubes [for Nixon].\\" When the Watergate investigation began to pick up speed, tapes revealed that Nixon remarked to his then-Chief of Staff Alexander Haig, \\"Oh shit, he's dumb as hell.\\"  Journalist Scott Armstrong, a Democratic investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, is critical of Thompson for having disclosed the committee's knowledge of the tapes to Buzhardt during an ongoing investigation, and says Thompson was \\"a mole for the White House\\" and that Thompson's actions gave the White House a chance to destroy the tapes. Thompson's 1975 book At That Point in Time, in turn, accused Armstrong of having been too close to The Washington Post's Bob Woodward and of leaking committee information to him. In response to renewed interest in this matter, in 2007 during his presidential campaign, Thompson said, \\"I'm glad all of this has finally caused someone to read my Watergate book, even though it's taken them over 30 years.\\"\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Fred Thompson","rationale":"This paragraph is about a U.S. senator named Fred Thompson, who was involved in the Watergate scandal and investigation during Richard Nixon's presidency in early 1970s.

A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska.

This could account for the increased airway narrowing seen in vivo in allergic bronchoconstriction. It was associated with increased velocity of shortening. We now report that, by using an electromagnetic muscle lever system, quick releases were applied to control and sensitized TSM at 0.5-s intervals throughout the course of a lightly preloaded 10-s isotonic contraction. From the records obtained it is possible to determine that, early in contraction, shortening is brought about by relatively rapidly cycling [0.35 optimal muscle length units +/- 0.033/s (SE)] cross bridges. We also report that in the sensitized TSM it is the early bridges that increase their velocity by 26.6% (P less than 0.05) compared with similar bridges in muscles from control animals. Since 70% of the maximum shortening of the muscle occurs when early bridges are operative, it is likely that these bridges are responsible for the major part of the shortening. It is thus probable that increased allergic bronchoconstriction is produced by increased activity of early, rapidly cycling bridges. The bridges that are active late in the shortening show no difference between control and sensitized airway smooth muscles. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"It includes numerical values, such as the percentage increase in velocity of shortening in the sensitized TSM (26.6% vs. 0%, P < 0.05), and the number of cross bridges that are operating early in contraction (70%).

Passage 1:Ludwig Kübler (2 September 1889 – 18 August 1947) was a German General der Gebirgstruppe (Lieutenant General) who commanded the 1st Mountain Division, XXXXIX Mountain Corps, 4th Army and the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral during World War II. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his actions commanding the 1st Mountain Division during the invasion of Poland in 1939. He also commanded the division during the invasion of France and the Low Countries before being appointed to command XXXXIX Mountain Corps. During his command of this corps it was involved in the invasion of Yugoslavia and the attack on the Soviet Union. In December 1941 he was appointed to command the 4th Army, but was dismissed from this post in January of the following year, and placed in the Führerreserve des Heeres (senior officer reserve pool). In September 1943 he was appointed as the commanding general of security troops for Army Group Centre on the Eastern Front, but the following month he was appointed to command the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, based at Trieste on the northern Adriatic coast. After being captured by Yugoslav forces at the end of the war, he was tried and executed for war crimes.\\n Passage 2:To avoid conflict with the English (with whom, due to the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch were at war), rather than passing through the English Channel, the ship was directed northwards where the plan would be to sail around the north of the British Isles (known as \\"going north about\\", which was commonly practised by Dutch East India ships at that time), before heading southwards again. Due to the extreme weather conditions in its journey northwards, the ship lost its masts and rudder, and southerly winds prevented the ship from being able to pass through either the Pentland Firth or the Fair Isle Channel, so the ship was (probably with considerable difficulty) taken into Ronas Voe in the north-west of Northmavine, Mainland, Shetland to shelter until the weather improved, and to allow the ship to be repaired. The voe (Shetland dialect for an inlet or fjord forms a crescent shape around Ronas Hill, which would have allowed the ship to lie sheltered regardless of the direction of the wind. A combination of prevailing southerly winds, and, presumably, a scarcity of suitable wood available in Shetland at that time to replace its masts prevented the ship from continuing its journey, and as such it remained in Ronas Voe until March 1674.\\n Passage 3:York started his career with Handsworth Royal, Birchfield Rangers and the Royal Air Force, and also guested for Chelsea during World War I.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999.

Both sides paused for desultory negotiations before the war recommenced; John's position was now stronger, thanks to confirmation that the counts Baldwin IX of Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne had renewed the anti-French alliances they had previously agreed to with Richard. The powerful Anjou nobleman William des Roches was persuaded to switch sides from Arthur to John; suddenly the balance seemed to be tipping away from Philip and Arthur in favour of John. Neither side was keen to continue the conflict, and following a papal truce the two leaders met in January 1200 to negotiate possible terms for peace. From John's perspective, what then followed represented an opportunity to stabilise control over his continental possessions and produce a lasting peace with Philip in Paris. John and Philip negotiated the May 1200 Treaty of Le Goulet; by this treaty, Philip recognised John as the rightful heir to Richard in respect to his French possessions, temporarily abandoning the wider claims of his client, Arthur.[nb 4] John, in turn, abandoned Richard's former policy of containing Philip through alliances with Flanders and Boulogne, and accepted Philip's right as the legitimate feudal overlord of John's lands in France.

These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\\nHow would you define creativity?\\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you?

Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \\"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \\"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \\"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body.

His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block.

Although lt has been living in the cloud forests of South Amcrica for some time.\\nScientists say the olinguito is the first new carnivore discovered In the Americas in more than 30 years. It is a hairy orange-brown creature with a sweet face and big eyes The animal has small. rounded ears and lives in the trees An adult weighs one kilogram and measures about 75 centimeters. with half of those centimeters taken up by its ringed tail Most of the time. it likes to eat fruit, although it also eats meat. Active at night, the animal has lived in Colombia and Ecuador for a long time. But the olinguito did not exist in science books before now.\\nKristofer Helgen, director at the National Museum in Washington, led the research team that confirmed the existence of the olinguito. It had been mistaken more than a century ago for a look-alike animal -- a similar but larger olingo . Mr. Helgen had been studying olingos in a museum for ten years. At that time. he observed a difference in the size and shape of the heads and teeth. That led him on an effort to prove he was looking at an animal never before described by science. He got lucky when he communicated with a zoologist in Ecuador. The animal expert there made a short video that shows an olinguito in the trees. The video confirms that the oiinguito is different from the olingo     Mr. Helgen says tens of thousands of olinguitos live in the wild and are not in danger of disappearing forever. Human beings, however, are moving closer to the olinguito habitat in the Andean cloud forests.

Diets that don't allow any fat also can be bad for you. Everyone needs a certain amount of fat in their diet -- up to 30% of total calories -- so no one should eat a completely fat-free diet.\\nDon't have diets that restrict  certain food groups, either. A diet that requires you to say no to bread or pasta or allows you to eat only fruit is unhealthy. You won't get the vitamins and minerals you need. And although you may lose weight, you'll probably gain it back as soon as you start eating normally again.\\nSome people start dieting because they think all the problems in their lives are because of weight. Others have an area of their lives that they can't control, like an alcoholic parent, so they focus on something they can control -- their exercise and food intake.\\nPeople who diet may get lots of praise from friends and family when they start losing pounds, which makes them feel good. But eventually a person reaches a weight level -- and doesn't lose as much weight as before because the body is trying to keep a healthy weight, so they aren't any happier.\\nSome people may find it hard to control their eating, so they stick with  _ for a little while, but then eat tons of food. Feeling guilty about the binge, they use laxatives . Eating too little to maintain a healthy weight or eating only to throw up the calories are both eating disorders, which are harmful to a person's health.\\nQuestion: Which is not the result of restricting certain food groups?\\n- lose weight for a short period\\n- unhealthy\\n- short of nutrition\\n- hungry","target":"hungry","rationale":"The article talks about the negative consequences of restricting certain food groups on a diet. The passage outlines four results, including losing weight for only a short period and being unhealthy.\\nHowever, the article does not mention that people who do this will feel hungry because they are eating too little to maintain their health bodyweight. This is unlike other diets which may lead to feeling hungrier due to avoiding foods high in fat or carbs as our bodies need them to function properly but can be avoided if necessary with proper substitutions (e.g., swapping regular pasta out for whole wheat).\\nSo the best answer is \\"hungry\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you need to answer basic science questions.

In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth.

According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.

They captured various key points and announced over national radio the overthrow of the incumbent regime. With the help of the Americans, Khánh was able to rally support and the coup collapsed the next morning without any casualties.\\nIn the immediate month leading up the coup, Khánh's leadership had become increasingly troubled. He had tried to augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency, but this only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling for an end to military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future. He also removed several military officials closely linked to the discriminatory Catholic rule of the slain former President Ngô Đình Diệm; this response to Buddhist pressure dismayed several Catholic officers, who made a few abortive moves to remove him from power.\\nIn part because of pressure from Buddhist protests, Khánh removed the Catholics Phát and Đức from the posts of Interior Minister and IV Corps commander, respectively. They responded with a coup supported by the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng, as well as General Trần Thiện Khiêm, a Catholic who had helped Khánh to power. Having captured the radio station, Phát then made a broadcast promising to revive Diệm's policies. Khánh managed to evade capture and, during the first stage of the coup, there was little activity as most senior officers failed to support either side.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Peter decided to sugar mangoes, ginger, pineapples, peaches to preserve them for next spring.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen.\\nThere was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.\\nThe telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette.\\n\\"Admit it now, Ray.\\" She sounded petulant.\\n\\"Fine, I admit it.

Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \\"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\\" The President reportedly also said,\\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Kant argues that the human mind creates the structure of human experience, that reason is the source of morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that the world as it is \\"in-itself\\" is independent of humanity's concepts of it. Kant took himself to have effected a \\"Copernican revolution\\" in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolves around the earth.\\n\\nIn \\"Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch\\", Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics. His classical republican theory was extended in the Science of Right, the first part of the Metaphysics of Morals (1797). Kant believed that universal history leads to the ultimate world of republican states at peace, but his theory was not pragmatic. The process was described in \\"Perpetual Peace\\" as natural rather than rational:  The guarantee of perpetual peace is nothing less than that great artist, nature...In her mechanical course we see that her aim is to produce a harmony among men, against their will, and indeed through their discord. As a necessity working according to laws we do not know, we call it destiny. But, considering its designs in universal history, we call it \\"providence,\\" inasmuch as we discern in it the profound wisdom of a higher cause which predetermines the course of nature and directs it to the objective final end of the human race.  Kant's political thought can be summarized as republican government and international organization. \\"In more characteristically Kantian terms, it is doctrine of the state based upon the law (Rechtsstaat) and of eternal peace. Indeed, in each of these formulations, both terms express the same idea: that of legal constitution or of 'peace through law'. Taken simply by itself, Kant's political philosophy, being essentially a legal doctrine, rejects by definition the opposition between moral education and the play of passions as alternate foundations for social life. The state is defined as the union of men under law. The state rightly so called is constituted by laws which are necessary a priori because they flow from the very concept of law. A regime can be judged by no other criteria nor be assigned any other functions, than those proper to the lawful order as such.\\"  He opposed \\"democracy,\\" which at his time meant direct democracy, believing that majority rule posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, \\"...democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which 'all' decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, 'all,' who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom.\\" As with most writers at the time, he distinguished three forms of government i.e. democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with mixed government as the most ideal form of it.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"What else was interesting about his political philosophy?","rationale":"A good question relevant to the article along with its content is \\"What else was interesting about his political philosophy?\\".
