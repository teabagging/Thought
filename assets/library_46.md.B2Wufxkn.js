Examining the role of the family, particularly the husband, during pregnancy and childbirth is important to understanding women's access to and utilization of professional maternal health services that can prevent maternal mortality. This qualitative study examines husbands' involvement during childbirth and professional delivery care utilization in a rural sub-district of Netrokona district, Bangladesh.   \\n METHODS Using purposive sampling, ten households utilizing a skilled attendant during the birth of the youngest child were selected and matched with ten households utilizing an untrained traditional birth attendant, or dhatri. Households were selected based on a set of inclusion criteria, such as approximate household income, ethnicity, and distance to the nearest hospital. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted in Bangla with husbands in these households in June 2010. Interviews were transcribed, translated into English, and analyzed using NVivo 9.0.   \\n RESULTS By purposefully selecting households that differed on the type of provider utilized during delivery, common themes--high costs, poor transportation, and long distances to health facilities--were eliminated as sufficient barriers to the utilization of professional delivery care. Divergent themes, namely husbands' social support and perceived social norms, were identified as underlying factors associated with delivery care utilization. We found that husbands whose wives utilized professional delivery care provided emotional, instrumental and informational support to their wives during delivery and believed that medical intervention was necessary. By contrast, husbands whose wives utilized an untrained dhatri at home were uninvolved during delivery and believed childbirth should take place at home according to local traditions.   \\n CONCLUSIONS This study provides novel evidence about male involvement during childbirth in rural Bangladesh. These findings have important implications for program planners, who should pursue culturally sensitive ways to involve husbands in maternal health interventions and assess the effectiveness of education strategies targeted at husbands.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract begins with a topic sentence that briefly summarizes the main idea of the study.

Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.\\n\\n- Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth (aeronautics) and surrounding space (astronautics). Aerospace organisations research, design, manufacture, operate, or maintain aircraft and/or spacecraft. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial and military applications.\\n\\n- Fiat Aviazione was an Italian aircraft manufacturer, at one time part of the Fiat group, focused mainly on military aviation. After World War I, Fiat consolidated several Italian small aircraft manufacturers, like Pomilio and Ansaldo. Most famous were the Fiat biplane fighter aircraft of the 1930s, the Fiat CR.32 and the Fiat CR.42. Other notable designs were the fighters CR.20, G.50, G.55 and a bomber, the Fiat BR.20. In the 1950s, the company designed the G.91 light ground attack plane. In 1969, Fiat Aviazione merged with Aerfer to create Aeritalia, which would become Alenia Aeronautica in 1990.\\n\\n- A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance. Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are \\"unincorporated\\" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions?\\n\\n- The Aeritalia G.222 ( formerly Fiat Aviazione , later Alenia Aeronautica ) is a medium - sized STOL military transport aircraft . It was developed to meet a NATO specification , but Italy was initially the only NATO member to adopt the type . The United States purchased a small number of G.222s , designating them the C - 27A Spartan . A modernised variant , the Alenia C - 27J Spartan , has been developed .

It was first discussed by the Bulgarian Society Novae, after being proposed as an American initiative at the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Travemünde, Germany, on 2021 October 1993, and formally launched on 1011 January 1994 NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium.\\n\\n- Uncontrolled airspace is airspace where an Air Traffic Control (ATC) service is not deemed necessary or cannot be provided for practical reasons. According to the airspace classes set by ICAO, both class F and class G airspace are uncontrolled. It is the opposite of controlled airspace.\\n\\n- Alenia Aeronautica was an Italian aerospace company. Its subsidiaries included Alenia Aermacchi and Alenia Aeronavali. Alenia Aeronautica owns ATR, a joint venture with EADS. In January 2012, the company was reorganized as Alenia Aermacchi.\\n\\n- The Fiat BR.20 \\"Cicogna\\" (Italian: \\"stork\\") was a low-wing twin-engine medium bomber produced from the mid-1930s until the end of World War II by the Turin firm. When it entered service in 1936 it was the first all-metal Italian bomber and it was regarded as one of the most modern medium bombers in the world. It had its baptism of fire in summer 1937, with Aviazione Legionaria, during the Spanish Civil War, when it formed the backbone of Nationalist bombing operations along with the Heinkel He 111. It was then used successfully by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\\nWhen Italy entered war in 1940, the BR.20 was the standard medium bomber of the Regia Aeronautica, but was approaching obsolescence. By 1942, it was mostly used for maritime patrol and operational training for bomber crews.\\nMore than 500 were produced before the end of the war.\\n\\n- Takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aerospace vehicle or animal goes from the ground to flying in the air.\\n\\n- A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets. The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft.\\n\\n- An airlift is the organized delivery of military supplies or military personnel primarily via military transport aircraft.\\n\\n- A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.\\n\\n- Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.\\n\\n- Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. \\nThe country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.\\n\\n- Military transport aircraft or military cargo aircraft are typically fixed wing and rotary wing cargo aircraft which are used to airlift troops, weapons and other military equipment by a variety of methods to any area of military operations around the surface of the planet, usually outside the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace. Originally derived from bombers, military transport aircraft were used for delivering airborne forces during the Second World War and towing military gliders. Some military transport aircraft are tasked to perform multi-role duties such as aerial refueling and, rescue missions, tactical, operational and strategic airlifts onto unprepared runways, or those constructed by engineers.\\n\\n- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO  '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.\\n\\n- Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft. It has two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Avionics engineering is similar but deals with the electrical side of aerospace engineering.\\n\\n- A STOLport or STOLPORT was an airport designed with STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) operations in mind, usually for an aircraft class of its weight and size. The term STOLport did not appear to be in common usage as of 2008. A STOLport normally had a short single runway, in general shorter than . STOLports only accepted certain types of aircraft, often only smaller propeller aircraft, often with limits on the amount of fuel that can be taken. In the United States, short runway facilities are simply known as airports and the term STOLport has not been commonly used since the early 1970s.\\n\\n- The Fiat CR.42 \\"Falco\\" (\\"Falcon\\", plural: \\"Falchi\\") was a single-seat sesquiplane fighter that served primarily in Italy's \\"Regia Aeronautica\\" before and during World War II. The aircraft was produced by Fiat Aviazione, and entered service, in smaller numbers, with the air forces of Belgium, Sweden and Hungary. With more than 1,800 built, it was the most numerous Italian aircraft in World War II. The CR.42 was the last of the Fiat biplane fighters to enter front line service, and represented the epitome of the type, along with the Gloster Gladiator.\\n\\n- A cargo aircraft (also known as freight aircraft, freighter, airlifter or cargo jet) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is designed or converted for the carriage of cargo rather than passengers. Such aircraft usually do not incorporate passenger amenities and generally feature one or more large doors for loading cargo. Freighters may be operated by civil passenger or cargo airlines, by private individuals or by the armed forces of individual countries (for the last see military transport aircraft).\\nAircraft designed for cargo flight usually have features that distinguish them from conventional passenger aircraft: a wide/tall fuselage cross-section, a high-wing to allow the cargo area to sit near the ground, a large number of wheels to allow it to land at unprepared locations, and a high-mounted tail to allow cargo to be driven directly into and off the aircraft.\\n\\n- Aerial refueling, also referred to as air refueling, in-flight refueling (IFR), air-to-air refueling (AAR), and tanking, is the process of transferring aviation fuel from one military aircraft (the tanker) to another (the receiver) during flight. The two main refueling systems are probe-and-drogue, which is simpler to adapt to existing aircraft, and the flying boom, which offers faster fuel transfer, but requires a dedicated boom operator station.\\n\\n- Military gliders (an offshoot of common gliders) have been used by the military of various countries for carrying troops and heavy equipment (see Glider infantry) to a combat zone, mainly during the Second World War. These engineless aircraft were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes, e.g., C-47 Skytrain or Dakota, or bombers relegated to secondary activities, e.g., Short Stirling. Military gliders do not soar. Once released from the tow craft near the front, they were to land on any convenient open terrain close to target, hopefully with as little damage to the cargo and crew as possible as most landing zones (LZ) were far from ideal. The one-way nature of the missions meant that they were treated as disposable leading to construction from common and inexpensive materials such as wood.\\n\\n- Airborne forces are military units, usually light infantry, set up to be moved by aircraft and \\"dropped\\" into battle, typically by parachute. Thus, they can be placed behind enemy lines, and have the capability to deploy almost anywhere with little warning. The formations are limited only by the number and size of their aircraft, so given enough capacity a huge force can appear \\"out of nowhere\\" in minutes, an action referred to as \\"vertical envelopment\\".\\n\\n- A boot is a type of footwear and a specific type of shoe. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality  protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking)  and for reasons of style and fashion.\\n\\n- World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'aeritalia g.222' exhibits the relationship of 'use'.

Thus, the viral cell receptor is an attractive target for anti-viral strategies, and the identification of viral cell receptor is critical for better understanding and controlling viral disease. As a model system for viral entry and anti-retroviral approaches, avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV, including the A-J ten subgroups) has been studied intensively and many milestone discoveries have been achieved based on work with ASLV. Here, we used a DF1 cell line expressed viral receptor-binding protein to efficiently identify chicken Annexin A2 (chANXA2) as a novel receptor for retrovirus ALV-J (avian leukosis virus subgroup J). Our data demonstrate that antibodies or siRNA to chANXA2 significantly inhibited ALV-J infection and replication, and over-expression of chANXA2 permitted the entry of ALV-J into its non-permissible cells.

In the Old Elamite period , Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian Plateau, centered in Anshan, and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands. Its culture played a crucial role in the Gutian Empire and especially during the Iranic Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded it. The Oxus civilization was a Bronze Age Central Asian culture dated to c. 2300-1700 BC and centered on the upper Amu Darya . In the Early Bronze Age the culture of the Kopet Dag oases and Altyndepe developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to level IV at Namazga-Tepe. Altyndepe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown. The height of this urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age c. 2300 BC, corresponding to level V at Namazga-Depe. This Bronze Age culture is called the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex . The Kulli culture, similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilisation, was located in southern Balochistan  c. 2500-2000 BC. Agriculture was the economical base of this people.

However, special consideration must be given to the development of such services in small communities, chiefly because of problems associated with the low volume of true emergency calls. Communities considering implementing programs by which defibrillation is performed by the emergency medical technician (EMT-D) must first evaluate their ambulance response times and, if inadequate, alter their system of ambulance response. After implementation of such a program, a permanent, formal skill maintenance program must be established. Defibrillation protocols must allow for the fact that many patients will refibrillate after successful conversion, yet no advanced care beyond the defibrillator will generally be available. Finally, every community instituting an EMT-D program must maintain a system of monitoring EMT performance and patient outcome that documents acceptable survival-to-discharge rates as well as the safety of the program. For smaller communities a regional or statewide evaluation system may be preferable to individual community programs. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Special considerations for defibrillation performed by emergency medical technicians in small communities. option2: The NK-1.1(-) mouse: a model to study differentiation of murine NK cells.","target":"Special considerations for defibrillation performed by emergency medical technicians in small communities","rationale":"The abstract describes the special considerations that should be given to the development of medical programs that allow ambulance technicians to perform defibrillation in small communities.

Most current approaches learn to address this task in an end-to-end way with neural networks, without maintaining an explicit representation of the reasoning process. We propose a method to extract a discrete reasoning chain over the text, which consists of a series of sentences leading to the answer. We then feed the extracted chains to a BERT-based QA model to do final answer prediction. Critically, we do not rely on gold annotated chains or \`\`supporting facts:'' at training time, we derive pseudogold reasoning chains using heuristics based on named entity recognition and coreference resolution. Nor do we rely on these annotations at test time, as our model learns to extract chains from raw text alone.   We test our approach on two recently proposed large multi-hop question answering datasets: WikiHop and HotpotQA, and achieve state-of-art performance on WikiHop and strong performance on HotpotQA. Our analysis shows the properties of chains that are crucial for high performance: in particular, modeling extraction sequentially is important, as is dealing with each candidate sentence in a context-aware way. Furthermore, human evaluation shows that our extracted chains allow humans to give answers with high confidence, indicating that these are a strong intermediate abstraction for this task.","target":"We improve answering of questions that require multi-hop reasoning extracting an intermediate chain of sentences","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe improve answering of questions that require multi-hop reasoning extracting an intermediate chain of sentences."},{"source":"Multi-select: Let's say that \\"Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems because she is indiscreet.\\"\\n\\nCan we now say that \\"Susan is indiscreet.\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes","target":"no","rationale":"This hypothesis is not necessarily true because it is only possible that Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about $30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about $1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale.

The simplest are unjointed and form paired bundles near the top and bottom of each side of each segment. The parapodia (\\"limbs\\") of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips – for example jointed, comb-like or hooked. Chetae are made of moderately flexible β-chitin and are formed by follicles, each of which has a chetoblast (\\"hair-forming\\") cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta. The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming microvilli, fine hair-like extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta.

Because air presses down on us from all directions at the same time, and because we are able to bear   this weight, we do not seem to feel it.

Passage 1:Billy Hughes was a former prime minister who had been successively a member of the Labor Party, the National Labor Party, and the Nationalist Party. By 1928, he was the de facto leader of a group of backbenchers hostile to the government of Stanley Bruce (who had replaced him as Nationalist leader in 1923). He and his supporters began to frequently cross the floor and vote against the government, particularly on the controversial subject of industrial relations. On 22 August 1929, Hughes and Edward Mann were expelled from the Nationalist Party for voting in favour of an unsuccessful censure motion against the government. Tensions finally came to a head on 10 September, when Hughes successfully moved an amendment to the government's flagship Maritime Industries Bill. Bruce took this to be a vote of no confidence, and called an election for 12 October. Labor under James Scullin won a landslide victory, while Hughes and two other ex-Nationalists were re-elected as independents.\\n Passage 2:In 1993, Vintage Crop made a brief return to hurdling to finish sixth to Granville Again in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham Racecourse before being aimed at long distance races on the flat. He won a minor race at Leopardstown Racecourse and the Listed Curragh Cup as well as being placed in the Saval Beg Stakes and the Meld Stakes and finishing sixth in the Ascot Gold Cup. On 18 September, the gelding ran for the second time in the Irish St Leger and started at odds of 9/2 against a field which included Drum Taps and Snurge. Ridden by Mick Kinane, he took the lead approaching the final quarter mile and won by two and a half lengths from Assessor. Vintage Crop was then sent to Australia in an attempt to become the first foreign-trained horse to win the Melbourne Cup. Ridden again by Kinane, the Irish gelding produced a strong run in the straight to overtake Te Akau Nick in the closing stages and win going away by three lengths. The unplaced horses included Subzero, The Phantom and Drum Taps.\\n Passage 3:The airline was established in 1993 by Mike Brady of Express Airlines I in Atlanta, Georgia. The airline started operations in August 1993. Its route structure in many ways mimiced an unrelated defunct predecessor named Chicago Air which also operated from Chicago Midway's airport less than a decade before. On June 1, 1999, Chicago Express became a wholly owned subsidiary of Amtran, later known as ATA Holdings and now Global Aero Logistics, and operated as ATA Connection, a regional code sharing affiliate of the now defunct ATA Airlines (formerly known as American Trans Air). Chicago Express' principal base of operations was Chicago Midway International Airport, where the company maintained its headquarters. For several months before its liquidation, the company also operated a hub in Indianapolis, part of ATA's failed plan for intrastate flights throughout Indiana. However, following ATA Holdings' decision to codeshare flights with Southwest Airlines, a decision was made to terminate Chicago Express effective March 28, 2005, in favor of a strictly mainline operation.

The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich forest will have more honey fungus?\\n\\nHint: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]","target":"Peak Forest","rationale":"Honey fungus is a wood-decay fungi. The presence of water and decaying trees in Peak Forest provides the ideal conditions for honey fungus growth, which explains why more fungi are present there.

The deal is worth $7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at $14 million after the first year and $21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004.

His attempt to poison her is thwarted because she is already so drunk when she arrives at his place that she spills her glass of wine onto the floor. On the next attempt, she giddily mixed up his glass of wine with hers. He finally loses patience on the third try when she swallows the poisoned glassful, only to vomit before it can take effect. As Maggie excuses herself to the bathroom to clean up, he attacks her with a wooden stick. Her scalp splits apart and she runs screaming from the bathroom with blood streaming down her face. He chases her down the corridor bashing her head repeatedly, causing skin to rip away from her face, and a single bloodshot eyeball to roll out of her right eye socket onto the floor. Playing dead for a few seconds, Maggie rises when Parson's back is turned and makes another mad dash for the front door, but is rounded up and punched unconscious.

Techniques of insertion were vigorously supervised. Central and peripheral catheters were cared for by identical protocols. Overt phlebitis or inflammation around the site was 14 times as common with peripheral catheters (353/1,024) than with centrally inserted central catheters (18/713), even though peripheral catheters were removed on the average at 2.9 days and centrally inserted central catheters at 6.2 days. Pneumothorax occurred in seven out of 713 patients with centrally inserted central catheterization, one with hemothorax and two with pneumothoraces requiring thoracostomy tubes. Five were treated successfully with simple catheter aspiration. Three patients out of 1,496 with peripheral or peripherally inserted central catheters required phlebectomy for suppurative thrombophlebitis. We concluded that overall morbidity in critically ill patients is lower from centrally inserted central catheters than peripheral intravenous catheters, with peripherally inserted central catheters in an intermediate position. Supervision of techniques of insertion has to be kept at a high level to keep complications of central catheterization at an acceptable level.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\"?","target":"What is Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular?","rationale":"The question \\"What is Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular?\\" can be used to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it."},{"source":"Multi-choice problem: Is \\"Harry knew much less than Mark did.\\" true if \\"Of one thing Mark was sure.

Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted.

The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the full name of the person in whose view the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music?","target":"Ronald Crichton","rationale":"In the context, Ronald Crichton writes that Saint-Saëns's operatic scores have \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ...

Rob's plant were ok, because he adjusted the soil's ph with sweet lime.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich garden had more plants wilting?\\n\\nHint: Wilting is the loss of rigidity of non-woody parts of plants. This occurs when the turgor pressure in non-lignified plant cells falls towards zero, as a result of diminished water in the cells. The rate of loss of water from the plant is greater than the absorption of water in the plant. The process of wilting modifies the leaf angle distribution of the plant (or canopy) towards more erectophile conditions.\\n\\nLower water availability may result from:\\n\\ndrought conditions, where the soil moisture drops below conditions most favorable for plant functioning;\\nthe temperature falls to the point where the plants vascular system can not function.\\nhigh salinity, which causes water to diffuse from the plant cells and induce shrinkage;\\nsaturated soil conditions, where roots are unable to obtain sufficient oxygen for cellular respiration, and so are unable to transport water into the plant; or\\nbacteria or fungi that clog the plant's vascular system.\\nWilting diminishes the plant's ability to transpire and grow. Permanent wilting leads to plant death.

But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe.\\nPrevious studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure.\\nThe authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health.\\nQuestion: What can we learn from the text?\\nAnswer:","target":"Stricter regulations on pollutants should be made.","rationale":"The article discusses the dangers of air pollution and its effects on heart-related problems.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust.

A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a $250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice.

G-quadruplex structure in a DNA substrate can block its extension by telomerase. We have found that hnRNP A1--which was previously implicated in telomere length regulation--binds to both single-stranded and structured human telomeric repeats, and in the latter case, it disrupts their higher-order structure. Using an in vitro telomerase assay, we observed that depletion of hnRNP A/B proteins from 293 human embryonic kidney cell extracts dramatically reduced telomerase activity, which was fully recovered upon addition of purified recombinant hnRNP A1. This finding suggests that hnRNP A1 functions as an auxiliary, if not essential, factor of telomerase holoenzyme. We further show, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, that hnRNP A1 associates with human telomeres in vivo.

This study examined the co-detections, the distribution of viruses, symptoms, and illness burden associated with ARI between December 2012 and March 2013. Methods: Outpatients with ARI were assayed for presence of 18 viruses using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) to simultaneously detect multiple viruses. Results: Among 935 patients, 60% tested positive for a single virus, 9% tested positive for ≥1 virus and 287 (31%) tested negative. Among children (<18 years), the respective distributions were 63%, 14%, and 23%; whereas for younger adults (18-49 years), the distributions were 58%, 8%, and 34% and for older adults (≥50 years) the distributions were 61%, 5%, and 32% (P < 0.001). Co-detections were more common in children than older adults (P = 0.01), and less frequent in households without children (P = 0.003). Most frequently co-detected viruses were coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus. Compared with single viral infections, those with co-detections less frequently reported sore throat (P = 0.01), missed fewer days of school (1.1 vs. 2 days; P = 0.04), or work (2 vs. 3 days; P = 0.03); other measures of illness severity did not vary. Conclusions: Among outpatients with ARI, 69% of visits were associated with a viral etiology. Co-detections of specific clusters of viruses were observed in 9% of ARI cases particularly in children, were less frequent in households without children, and were less symptomatic (e.g., lower fever) than single infections.","target":"influenza season","rationale":"The research paper focuses on the co-detections of certain viruses during influenza season, and the distribution of these viruses in different age groups.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\n\\nQuestion: What kind of people are being freed?\\nI found this answer \\"Those who have exhibited good behavior\\".

He also stated that he hoped Carmine would have more of a \\"darker turn\\", and that he still believes there is a \\"left over spark\\" with Abby as their storyline \\"was never finished\\" and \\"nothing was wrapped up properly\\".  Shortly after her failed relationship with Carmine, Abby took romantic interest in Detective Ignacio Serricchio's Alex Chavez, and they began dating. However, the relationship was short-lived when the writers soon began developing Abby's relationship with Redaric Williams's Tyler Michaelson. According to Williams, Tyler is \\"intrigued\\" by Abby's unpredictable nature and said that their natural attraction could lead to romance. However, Williams hinted that Tyler's interest in Abby could be his attempt to \\"suppress his feelings\\" for Lily. Abby and Tyler's relationship faced some interference from Tyler's ex-fiancee, Mariah Copeland, but she seemed to back off leading to Tyler proposing to Abby and they became engaged. However, Abby breaks off the engagement when Mariah's interferences causes Abby to believe Tyler is still in love with Mariah.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Abby Newman","rationale":"The text focuses on a character named Abby Newman, providing details about her romantic interests and relationships with other characters.

The name Plantagenet is used by modern historians to identify four distinct royal houses  the Angevins who were also Counts of Anjou, the main body of the Plantagenets following the loss of Anjou, and the houses of Lancaster and York, the Plantagenets' two cadet branches. The family held the English throne from 1154, with the accession of Henry II, until 1485, when Richard III died.\\n\\n- The House of Valois was a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. They succeeded the House of Capet (or \\"Direct Capetians\\") to the French throne, and were the royal house of France from 1328 to 1589. Junior members of the family founded cadet branches in Orléans, Anjou, Burgundy, and Alençon.\\n\\n- The county of Saint-Pol (or \\"Sint-Pols\\") was a county around the French city of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise (\\"Sint-Pols-aan-de-Ternas\\") on the border of Artois and Picardy, formerly the county of Ternois.\\n\\n- Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, \\"jure uxoris\\" 4th Earl of Ulster and 5th Baron of Connaught, KG (29 November 13387 October 1368) was the third son, but the second son to survive infancy, of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. He was named for his birthplace, at Antwerp in the Duchy of Brabant. Prince Lionel was born of a Flemish mother and was a grandson of William I, Count of Hainaut. He grew to be nearly seven feet in height and had an athletic build.\\n\\n- Edward of Norwich , 2nd Duke of York , KG ( c.1373 -- 25 October 1415 ) , was the eldest son of Edmund of Langley , 1st Duke of York , by his first wife Isabella of Castile , and the grandson of King Edward III. He held significant appointments during the reigns of the monarchs Richard II , Henry IV , and Henry V , and is also known for his translation of the hunting treatise The Master of Game . He was slain at the Battle of Agincourt , one of the principal military engagements of the Hundred Years ' War against France , in 1415 .\\n\\n- The Battle of Agincourt (in French, Azincourt ) was a major English victory in the Hundred Years' War. The battle took place on Friday, 25 October 1415 (Saint Crispin's Day) in the County of Saint-Pol, Artois, some 40 km south of Calais (now Azincourt in northern France). \\nHenry V's victory at Agincourt, against a numerically superior French army, crippled France and started a new period in the war during which Henry V married the French king's daughter, and their son, later Henry VI of England and Henry II of France, was made heir to the throne of France as well as of England.\\n\\n- The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the House of Plantagenet, rulers of the Kingdom of England, against the House of Valois, rulers of the Kingdom of France, over the succession of the French throne. Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages, in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe. The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong national identities in both countries.\\n\\n- The House of York was a cadet branch of the English royal House of Plantagenet. Three of its members became Kings of England in the late 15th century. The House of York was descended in the male line from Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, the fourth surviving son of Edward III, but also represented Edward's senior line, being cognatic descendants of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, Edward III's second surviving son. It is based on these descents that they claimed the English crown. Compared with the House of Lancaster, it had a senior claim to the throne of England according to cognatic primogeniture but junior claim according to the agnatic primogeniture. The reign of this dynasty ended with the death of Richard III of England in 1485. It became extinct in the male line with the death of Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick in 1499.\\n\\n- The House of Lancaster was the name of two cadet branches of the royal House of Plantagenet. The first house was created when Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the house was namedfor his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, after de Montfort's death and attainder at the end of the Second Barons' War. When Edmund's son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited his father-in-law's estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels. This brought himand Henry, his younger brotherinto conflict with their cousin Edward II of England, leading to Thomas's execution. Henry inherited Thomas's titles and he and his son, who was also called Henry, gave loyal service to Edward's sonEdward III of England.\\n\\n- Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, (5 June 1341  1 August 1402) was the fourth surviving son of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. Like many medieval English princes, Edmund gained his nickname from his birthplace: Kings Langley Palace in Hertfordshire. He was the founder of the House of York, but it was through the marriage of his younger son, Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, to Anne de Mortimer, great-granddaughter of Edmund's elder brother Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, that the House of York made its claim to the English throne in the Wars of the Roses. The other party in the Wars of the Roses, the incumbent House of Lancaster, was formed from descendants of Edmund's elder brother John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, Edward III's third son.\\n\\n- John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, (6 March 1340  3 February 1399) was a member of the House of Plantagenet, the third of five surviving sons of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. He was called \\"John of Gaunt\\" because he was born in Ghent, then rendered in English as \\"Gaunt\\".

A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \\"distributive efficiency\\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\\"the additional dollar\\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies[2][32] have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.\\n\\nFinland has one of the lowest economic inequality in the world. Finland's neighbor Russia has a different story.

This further implies that David (the Russian who is also rich) will likely have larger marginal utility than Greg (the other Russian resident).\\nSo, the answer to \\"Who would have smaller marginal utility?\\" should be \\"John\\", since his country's economy provides less opportunity for him to spend money without experiencing diminishing returns compared with people like Keith or Greg."},{"source":"Article: Nevertheless, Makdisi has asserted that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate.

Passage 1:Despite having claimed the Wild Card spot on the final day of the regular season, the Giants were able to tab ace Madison Bumgarner for the Wild Card game start. Bumgarner had an excellent regular season for the Giants, finishing with a career-low in ERA and a career-high in strikeouts, finishing fourth in the National League in both categories. On the hill for the New York Mets was Noah Syndergaard, who himself finished 3rd in the NL in ERA and 9th in strikeouts. The pitching matchup didn't disappoint, it took until the bottom of the third inning for the game's first hit and baserunner, with Syndergaard striking out four straight batters on two occasions. The closest either side came to scoring was in the top of the 6th when, after Denard Span singled and stole second base with two outs, Brandon Belt hit a long fly ball to center field which was caught on the dead run by Curtis Granderson, smashing into the wall and holding on. Syndergaard exited after 7 innings, having struck out 10. Crucially as it turned out, the Giants had forced Syndergaard out of the game with Bumgarner still going strong. Another golden opportunity was squandered by the Giants in the top of the 8th inning, when Addison Reed struck out Hunter Pence to end the inning with the bases loaded. After Bumgarner left a runner in scoring position in the bottom of the 8th, the game moved to the 9th with the Mets bringing in closer Jeurys Familia. Brandon Crawford led the inning off with a double to left-center, but Ángel Pagán couldn't lay down the sacrifice bunt and then struck out. Joe Panik worked a walk and Conor Gillaspie stepped up to the plate to launch a three-run home run to right field. Gillaspie had only started the game because Eduardo Núñez was still dealing with a hamstring injury and had to be left off the roster. Bumgarner then got the final three outs, completing the shutout just as he had done in the 2014 Wild Card Game. Bumgarner made 119 pitches, allowed just 6 total baserunners, striking out 6 and setting an MLB record of 23 consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason elimination games. With the win, the Giants equalled the Major League record for consecutive postseason series wins with 11, also extending their streak of postseason elimination game wins to 9.\\n Passage 2:Thompson was a presidential elector for the 1948 presidential election. From 1949 to 1956, he was a member of the Democratic National Committee. In 1947, he was a candidate in for the United States House of Representatives from Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district in the special election following the death of Robert Kirkland Henry. He lost to Glenn Robert Davis. Thompson was twice an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Wisconsin, losing to incumbent Oscar Rennebohm in 1948 and to Walter J. Kohler, Jr. in 1950, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1952 and 1956. After serving as an alderman and city attorney in Stoughton, he was a member of the Assembly from 1953 until 1959, when he was elected to the Senate in a special election. He remained in the Senate until 1984.\\n Passage 3:With 2003 and 2004 being mostly uneventful for Sekimoto, he started 2005 with a bang by winning the New Generation Battle Tournament by defeating HERO! in the final on January 9.

On July 13, 2008, Sekimoto and Mammoth Sasaki defeated Kengo Mashimo and Madoka for the BJW Tag Team Championship, however, on March 7, 2009, Saksaki was injured in an auto mobile accident and vacated the championship. In the Maximum Tag League 2009, Sekimoto and Masato Tanaka finished top of block B but would lose to Takashi Sasaki and Yuko Miyamoto in the semifinal.

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes.

Passage:In Austria, Gmunden, Graz, Innsbruck, Linz and Vienna all have tramway systems. With 173.4 km of track, Vienna's network is one of the largest in the world. The cars have been constantly modernised over the years and many are now ultra low-floored. Many of the Austrian tramlines have been in constant operation since they were first opened. Vienna started with horse trams in 1865 and electrification followed in 1897. Graz had horse trams in 1878 and electric cars in 1898 while Linz goes back to 1880 with electrification in 1897. The Gmunden Tramway, only 2.3 km long, is currently one of the shortest in the world, and with gradients of up to 9.6%, it is also one of the steepest and has become a popular tourist attraction. Innsbruck, which traditionally used second-hand trams from other cities, replaced its whole fleet with 32 Bombardier low-floor cars in Summer 2009. The Pöstlingbergbahn, in Linz, an unusual \\"mountain tramway\\", has a gradient of 10.6%, which makes it one of the world's steepest gradients on a surviving adhesion-only railway.

They are best known for their 1979 debut single \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" that topped the UK Singles Chart and reached number one in 15 other countries. The duo released their first album, The Age of Plastic, in January 1980 with \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" as its lead single. Soon after the album's release, Horn and Downes joined the progressive rock band\\n\\nIn early 1981, following the disbanding of Yes, Downes and Horn reconvened at Sarm East Studios to record The Buggles' second studio album, Adventures in Modern Recording. However, Downes left the group on the day the recording of the album was meant to begin to help form Asia with Howe citing musical differences. Horn was angry that Island Records renegotiated publishing terms for Downes to join Asia, but never did for Horn since, in his words, he was \\"washed up, career-wise\\". To fix this problem, Jill Sinclair made a deal with the French label Carrere, whose leader Claude Carrere, whom Horn described as a \\"very nice man\\", helped fund the album. Horn was now left to complete much of the album with several additional personnel.  Released in November 1981, Adventures in Modern Recording involved Horn experimenting with numerous production techniques, especially with the heavy use of sampling with the Fairlight CMI, with instruments from the computer such as the drums on \\"Inner City\\" and the big band jazz sounds on \\"Vermillion Sands\\". These same sampling techniques would later be used in records he produced such as Slave To The Rhythm by Grace Jones, Yes's 90125, Art of Noise's The Seduction of Claude Debussy and Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Welcome to the Pleasuredome. While the album garnered little attention in the United Kingdom, Horn recalled in 2010 that the album was a commercial success in France, and in the United States the album peaked at number 161 on the American Billboard 200. By the time of the album's release, when Horn was also producing ABC's album The Lexicon of Love, he decided to take Sinclair's advice that he always was meant to be a producer rather than a performer or songwriter, thus the performance of \\"Lenny\\" on a TV show in the Netherlands, with ABC as the backing band, marked the end of the Buggles. As Horn recalled when he was interviewed after the show:  \\"I'll never forget it because the guy said to me, 'well, things are not looking so good for you', and I said 'how do you mean?' And he said 'well, you know, your first record was a big hit now this record is number eleven, so your career is going downhill'. And I said 'well you know what? You see these guys, this is a band called ABC and I'm a producer now I don't really care about this stuff, I'm just doing it to promote the record.

The Security Council held its first session on 17 January 1946.\\n\\n- A short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft is an aircraft with short runway requirements for takeoff and landing. Many STOL-designed aircraft also feature various arrangements for use on runways with harsh conditions (such as high altitude or ice). STOL aircraft, including those used in scheduled passenger airline operations, have also been operated from STOLport airfields which feature short runways.\\n\\n- Aeritalia was an aerospace engineering corporation based in Italy, formed by the merger of Fiat Aviazione and Aerfer in 1969. Alenia Aeronautica was created in 1990 by concentrating the Finmeccanica aerospace and defense industries Aeritalia and Selenia. In 1990, Aeritalia and Selenia were merged by parent company Finmeccanica as Alenia Aeronautica.\\n\\n- The Fiat CR.32 was an Italian biplane fighter used in the Spanish Civil War and World War II. It was compact, robust and highly manoeuvrable and gave impressive displays all over Europe in the hands of the Italian \\"Pattuglie Acrobatiche\\". The CR.32 fought in North and East Africa, in Albania, and in the Mediterranean theatre. It saw service in the air forces of China, Austria, Hungary, Paraguay and Venezuela. Used extensively in the Spanish Civil War, it gained a reputation as one of the most outstanding fighter biplanes of all time. It was overtaken subsequently by more advanced monoplane designs and was obsolete by 1939.\\n\\n- According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a runway is a \\"defined rectangular area on a land aerodrome prepared for the landing and takeoff of aircraft\\". Runways may be a man-made surface (often asphalt, concrete, or a mixture of both) or a natural surface (grass, dirt, gravel, ice, or salt).\\n\\n- Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea.

When it entered service in 1936 it was the first all-metal Italian bomber and it was regarded as one of the most modern medium bombers in the world. It had its baptism of fire in summer 1937, with Aviazione Legionaria, during the Spanish Civil War, when it formed the backbone of Nationalist bombing operations along with the Heinkel He 111. It was then used successfully by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\\nWhen Italy entered war in 1940, the BR.20 was the standard medium bomber of the Regia Aeronautica, but was approaching obsolescence. By 1942, it was mostly used for maritime patrol and operational training for bomber crews.\\nMore than 500 were produced before the end of the war.\\n\\n- Takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aerospace vehicle or animal goes from the ground to flying in the air.\\n\\n- A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets. The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft.\\n\\n- An airlift is the organized delivery of military supplies or military personnel primarily via military transport aircraft.\\n\\n- A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.\\n\\n- Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.\\n\\n- Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. \\nThe country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.\\n\\n- Military transport aircraft or military cargo aircraft are typically fixed wing and rotary wing cargo aircraft which are used to airlift troops, weapons and other military equipment by a variety of methods to any area of military operations around the surface of the planet, usually outside the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace. Originally derived from bombers, military transport aircraft were used for delivering airborne forces during the Second World War and towing military gliders. Some military transport aircraft are tasked to perform multi-role duties such as aerial refueling and, rescue missions, tactical, operational and strategic airlifts onto unprepared runways, or those constructed by engineers.\\n\\n- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO  '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.\\n\\n- Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft. It has two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Avionics engineering is similar but deals with the electrical side of aerospace engineering.\\n\\n- A STOLport or STOLPORT was an airport designed with STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) operations in mind, usually for an aircraft class of its weight and size. The term STOLport did not appear to be in common usage as of 2008. A STOLport normally had a short single runway, in general shorter than . STOLports only accepted certain types of aircraft, often only smaller propeller aircraft, often with limits on the amount of fuel that can be taken. In the United States, short runway facilities are simply known as airports and the term STOLport has not been commonly used since the early 1970s.\\n\\n- The Fiat CR.42 \\"Falco\\" (\\"Falcon\\", plural: \\"Falchi\\") was a single-seat sesquiplane fighter that served primarily in Italy's \\"Regia Aeronautica\\" before and during World War II. The aircraft was produced by Fiat Aviazione, and entered service, in smaller numbers, with the air forces of Belgium, Sweden and Hungary. With more than 1,800 built, it was the most numerous Italian aircraft in World War II. The CR.42 was the last of the Fiat biplane fighters to enter front line service, and represented the epitome of the type, along with the Gloster Gladiator.\\n\\n- A cargo aircraft (also known as freight aircraft, freighter, airlifter or cargo jet) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is designed or converted for the carriage of cargo rather than passengers. Such aircraft usually do not incorporate passenger amenities and generally feature one or more large doors for loading cargo. Freighters may be operated by civil passenger or cargo airlines, by private individuals or by the armed forces of individual countries (for the last see military transport aircraft).\\nAircraft designed for cargo flight usually have features that distinguish them from conventional passenger aircraft: a wide/tall fuselage cross-section, a high-wing to allow the cargo area to sit near the ground, a large number of wheels to allow it to land at unprepared locations, and a high-mounted tail to allow cargo to be driven directly into and off the aircraft.\\n\\n- Aerial refueling, also referred to as air refueling, in-flight refueling (IFR), air-to-air refueling (AAR), and tanking, is the process of transferring aviation fuel from one military aircraft (the tanker) to another (the receiver) during flight. The two main refueling systems are probe-and-drogue, which is simpler to adapt to existing aircraft, and the flying boom, which offers faster fuel transfer, but requires a dedicated boom operator station.\\n\\n- Military gliders (an offshoot of common gliders) have been used by the military of various countries for carrying troops and heavy equipment (see Glider infantry) to a combat zone, mainly during the Second World War. These engineless aircraft were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes, e.g., C-47 Skytrain or Dakota, or bombers relegated to secondary activities, e.g., Short Stirling. Military gliders do not soar.

Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality  protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking)  and for reasons of style and fashion.\\n\\n- World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918.

After hiring a manager and recording a demo, he was introduced to rapper Pete Nice, and Cage was featured on the 1993 album Dust to Dust.

Mike now needs to figure out how the predator prey relationship balance the ecosystem.\\n\\nHint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.","target":"increase","rationale":"This question is about the relationship between three species, A (predator), B(prey), and C(plant). In a predator-prey system, predators keep their prey population in check. If there are more of one type of animal than another can sustain itself on, then that animal will die off due to lack of food or other resources. Thus we could infer that if Species A has an increase in its own population size it would harm Species B's ability to reproduce thus decreasing the number of individuals available for consumption by Species A. Since this will lead to less predation pressure exerted upon Species C by both these animals populations it should result in an overall increase in the total number of plants present as they face reduced competition from other organisms now able to survive because fewer members within each"},{"source":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is married to Eleanor? , can you please find it? \\n\\nA young man, Roger Martin, is propositioned by the lawyer of a wealthy businessman, Arthur Barret, to sleep with his wife Eleanor for a large sum, as the couple wish to have a child but Arthur is sterile.

Her mother has Danish, Welsh, German, English, and French ancestry, while her paternal grandparents, who were born in California, were both the children of Mexican immigrants. She has a younger brother, Joshua. Her third cousin, once removed, is writer Gustavo Arellano.\\n\\nAlba expressed an interest in acting from the age of five. In 1992, the 11-year-old Alba persuaded her mother to take her to an acting competition in Beverly Hills, where the grand prize was free acting classes. Alba won the grand prize, and took her first acting lessons. An agent signed Alba nine months later. Her first appearance on film was a small role in the 1994 feature Camp Nowhere as Gail. She was originally hired for two weeks but her role turned into a two-month job when one of the prominent actresses dropped out.  Alba appeared in two national television commercials for Nintendo and J. C. Penney as a child. She was later featured in several independent films. She branched out into television in 1994 with a recurring role as the vain Jessica in three episodes of the Nickelodeon comedy series The Secret World of Alex Mack. She then performed the role of Maya in the first two seasons of the television series Flipper. Under the tutelage of her lifeguard mother, Alba learned to swim before she could walk, and she was a PADI-certified scuba diver, skills which were put to use on the show, which was filmed in Australia.  In 1998, she appeared as Melissa Hauer in a first-season episode of the Steven Bochco crime-drama Brooklyn South, as Leanne in two episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210, and as Layla in an episode of Love Boat: The Next Wave. In 1999, she appeared in the Randy Quaid comedy feature P.U.N.K.S.. After Alba graduated from high school, she studied acting with William H. Macy and his wife, Felicity Huffman, at the Atlantic Theater Company, which was developed by Macy and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and film director, David Mamet. Alba rose to greater prominence in Hollywood in 1999 after appearing as a member of a snobby high school clique in the Drew Barrymore romantic comedy Never Been Kissed, and as the female lead in the 1999 comedy-horror film Idle Hands, opposite Devon Sawa.  Her big break came when writer/director James Cameron picked Alba from a pool of 1,200 candidates for the role of the genetically engineered super-soldier, Max Guevara, on the Fox sci-fi television series Dark Angel. Co-created by Cameron, the series starred Alba, and ran for two seasons until 2002. Alba earned critical acclaim for her role in the show, receiving a Golden Globe nomination as well as the Teen Choice Award for \\"Choice Actress\\" and Saturn Award for Best Actress.  Alba's film roles have included playing an aspiring dancer-choreographer in Honey, and an exotic dancer Nancy Callahan in Sin City, for which she received an MTV Movie Award for \\"Sexiest Performance.\\" Alba portrayed the Marvel Comics character Sue Storm, the Invisible Woman, in Fantastic Four and its sequel. She also starred in Into the Blue (2005), Good Luck Chuck (2007) and Awake (2007).  Alba hosted the 2006 MTV Movie Awards and performed sketches spoofing the movies King Kong, Mission: Impossible III, and The Da Vinci Code. In February 2008, she hosted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Science and Technical Awards. Alba has been represented by Brad Cafarelli.  Also in 2008, Alba made her acting transition to the horror-film genre in The Eye, a remake of the Hong Kong original. The film was released on February 1, 2008. Though the film was not well received by critics, Alba's performance itself received mixed reviews. She won a Teen Choice for Choice Movie Actress: Horror/Thriller  and a Razzie Award for Worst Actress-nomination. Later in 2008, Alba starred alongside Mike Myers and Justin Timberlake in The Love Guru.  In 2010, Alba starred in five films. She signed on to star as the lead role in An Invisible Sign of My Own in late 2008'. The movie was filmed in 2008, premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival, and was later released to theaters in May 2011. She also played Joyce Lakeland, a prostitute in The Killer Inside Me, a film adaption of the book of the same name which co-starred Kate Hudson and Casey Affleck. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Her second film of the year was the romantic comedy Valentine's Day, directed by Garry Marshall. She portrayed Ashton Kutcher's girlfriend, Morley Clarkson, in the ensemble film that included Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Garner, among others. Later that year, she appeared in the action film Machete, and in Little Fockers, reuniting with Robert De Niro who was also in Machete.  In 2011, Alba appeared in the film Spy Kids: All the Time in the World.  In January 2012, Alba and business partner Christopher Gavigan launched The Honest Company, a collection of household goods, diapers, and body care products. The company was valued at $1 billion as of 2014. In 2015, it was estimated that Alba owned 15 to 20 percent of the company. In March 2012, Alba announced that she would be releasing a book, The Honest Life, based on her experiences creating a natural, non-toxic life for her family. The book was published in early 2013 by Rodale and later became a New York Times Best Seller.  Alba's 2013 film projects included comedy A.C.O.D. and animated film Escape from Planet Earth. Alba reprised her roles, Santana in Machete's sequel Machete Kills, and Nancy Callahan in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, the sequel to 2005's Sin City. Filming for the Sin City sequel started in October 2012 and the film was released in August 2014.

Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents the high level of interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period.

The first Quranic manuscripts lacked these marks, therefore several recitations remain acceptable. The variation in readings of the text permitted by the nature of the defective vocalization led to an increase in the number of readings during the 10th century. The 10th-century Muslim scholar from Baghdad, Ibn Mujāhid, is famous for establishing seven acceptable textual readings of the Quran. He studied various readings and their trustworthiness and chose seven 8th-century readers from the cities of Mecca, Medina, Kufa, Basra and Damascus. Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers, rather than six or ten, but this may be related to a prophetic tradition (Muhammad's saying) reporting that the Quran had been revealed in seven \\"ahruf\\" (meaning seven letters or modes). Today, the most popular readings are those transmitted by Ḥafṣ (d.796) and Warsh (d. 812) which are according to two of Ibn Mujahid's reciters, Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud (Kufa, d. 745) and Nafi‘ al-Madani (Medina, d. 785), respectively. The influential standard Quran of Cairo (1924) uses an elaborate system of modified vowel-signs and a set of additional symbols for minute details and is based on ʻAsim's recitation, the 8th-century recitation of Kufa.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ).

His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.\\nLess is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.\\nLochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....","target":"Stefan","rationale":"The answer is Stefan."},{"source":"I gave my students this multiple choice question: Which characteristic property indicates that igneous rock cools slowly?\\n\\nOnly one answer is correct among these 4 choices:\\n- mineral composition\\n- hardness\\n- density\\n- crystal size\\n\\nCould you tell me which one is correct?","target":"crystal size","rationale":"Crystal size is used to determine if igneous rock cooled slowly or quickly. \\nIn a slow cooling rate, minerals have more time to form large crystals because they are formed from the magma's molten state as it cools down and hardens over longer period of time.

Jones was of Irish and Welsh descent; he later claimed partial Cherokee ancestry through his mother, but his maternal second cousin later stated this was likely untrue. Economic difficulties during the Great Depression necessitated that Jones' family move to the town of Lynn in 1934, where he grew up in a shack without plumbing.\\n\\nIn 1960, Indianapolis Mayor Charles Boswell appointed Jones director of the Human Rights Commission. Jones ignored Boswell's advice to keep a low profile, finding new outlets for his views on local radio and television programs. When the mayor and other commissioners asked Jones to curtail his public actions, he resisted and was wildly cheered at a meeting of the NAACP and Urban League when he yelled for his audience to be more militant, and then climaxed with, \\"Let my people go!\\"  During this time, Jones also helped to racially integrate churches, restaurants, the telephone company, the police department, a theater, an amusement park, and the Methodist Hospital. After swastikas were painted on the homes of two African-American families, Jones personally walked the neighborhood comforting local black people and counseling white families not to move, in order to prevent white flight.  Jones set up stings to catch restaurants refusing to serve black customers and wrote to American Nazi leaders and then leaked their responses to the media. When Jones was accidentally placed in the black ward of a hospital after a collapse in 1961, he refused to be moved; he began to make the beds and empty the bed pans of black patients. Political pressures resulting from Jones' actions caused hospital officials to desegregate the wards.  Jones received considerable criticism in Indiana for his integrationist views. White-owned businesses and locals were critical of him. A swastika was placed on the Temple, a stick of dynamite was left in a Temple coal pile, and a dead cat was thrown at Jones' house after a threatening phone call.

A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work.

It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".\\n\\n- Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Carolyn Janice Cherry (born September 1, 1942), better known by the pen name C.

The collapsing core increases temperature to the point that the star can begin to fuse helium into carbon. When that happens, the outer portion of the star expands greatly due to the higher temperature. The star can expand to 1000 times the diameter of the sun. At this point, the star is called a red giant . If our sun became a red giant, its surface would expand out past the orbit of Mars.

He told me he had been the manager of a certain grocery store in the neighborhood where I grew up, and he asked me if I remembered the egg cartons  .

For some reason, I decided it was up to me to put the display back together, so I went to work.\\nThe Manager heard the noise and came rushing over to see what had happened. When he appeared, I was on my knees inspecting (examining)some of the cartons to see if any of the eggs were broken, but to him it looked as though I was the criminal.

In this study, an analysis was carried out to determine whether IECs could promote the differentiation of CD103+ tolerogenic DCs, and the function of primary CD103+ DCs isolated from human mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) was evaluated.', \\"Monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) and circulating CD1c+ DCs were conditioned or not with supernatants from Caco-2 cells or IECs isolated from healthy donors or donors with Crohn's disease and analysed for their ability to induce T(reg) cell differentiation. In some cases, transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), retinoic acid (RA) or thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) were neutralised before conditioning. CD103+ and CD103- DCs were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from MLNs and used in T(reg) cell differentiation experiments.\\", \\"It was found that human IECs promoted the differentiation of tolerogenic DCs able to drive the development of adaptive Foxp3+ T(reg) cells. This control was lost in patients with Crohn's disease and paralleled a reduced expression of tolerogenic factors by primary IECs. MoDCs differentiated with RA or IEC supernatant upregulated the expression of CD103. Consistently, human primary CD103+ DCs isolated from MLNs were endowed with the ability to drive T(reg) cell differentiation. This subset of DCs expressed CCR7 and probably represents a lamina propria-derived migratory population.","target":"Do human intestinal epithelial cells promote the differentiation of tolerogenic dendritic cells?","rationale":"The question requires to use the words \\"human intestinal epithelial cells\\" and \\"tolerogenic dendritic cells\\" from the passage.

The area in question could be a habitat, a biome, or the entire biosphere. Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome. Species richness varies across the globe (Figure 45.29). One factor in determining species richness is latitude, with the greatest species richness occurring in ecosystems near the equator, which often have warmer temperatures, large amounts of rainfall, and low seasonality. The lowest species richness occurs near the poles, which are much colder, drier, and thus less conducive to life in Geologic time (time since glaciations). The predictability of climate or productivity is also an important factor. Other factors influence species richness as well. For example, the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin. Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome. Foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- nutrients\\n\\n- densities\\n\\n- water sources\\n\\n- species\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"species","rationale":"The paragraph talks about biodiversity and how it is measured by the number of different species (species richness) in a particular area and their relative abundance (species evenness).

The same logic applies for water sources mentioned in choice B as well.

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys. \\nWho called HUD to make sure she was allowed to kick out the tenants? \\nWould it be good to answer \\"Penny\\"?","target":"No","rationale":"The article says that the building manager called HUD to make sure she was allowed to kick out the tenants, but nobody from HUD ever called her back.

Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld.Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson (Rachel Grant), whose fiancee, fellow cop Van Huffel (Adam Leese), is furious at Stowe. Chief Mac Baylor (Gary Beadle) has a very blunt chat with Stowe about it. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry (Trevor Cooper) to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge. Stowe instead turns him over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers.Later, Van Huffel berates Stowe for getting Maria killed. Stowe responds by attacking Van Huffel in front of several officers. Later, Stowe meets with his estranged wife Valerie (Selina Giles), who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is on the rocks, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini (Mark Dymond), the gym teacher at the school she is principle of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and Valerie tells him she never wants to see him again.The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan. But he drunkenly stumbles into an ambush masterminded by Callahan, and is shot in the head by Callahan's right-hand man Jimmy (Stephen Lord).Stowe undergoes emergency surgery, and ends up in a coma. Months later, he recovers to the point that he opens his eyes, and is transported to his and Valerie's house to recover properly.Seven months after getting shot, Stowe has recovered a lot, although he must learn to walk and speak again. He manages to survive an attempt on his life, by someone who appears to be a cop. He's recovered enough to try to get his job back, but that's the one thing that Chief Baylor doesn't want to give him. The coma has led to his decision to become a better man, and to right some wrongs. He reconciles with his wife, although awkwardly, and gives Walter a check for $40,000, part of his insurance money that compensated his time in a coma. Finally, he visits the grave of fellow police officer Serge (William Ash), who once saved Stowe's life but has been killed by an unknown attacker following another failed sting operation.Valerie packs up to move out of the house so she can live with Mark, but after realizing the change that Stowe has undergone, she later decides to leave Mark and come back home. Stowe is convinced by his friend Chad Mansen (Wes Robinson) not to let his wife go, and Stowe goes after her. They miss each other by a few minutes.Just after Valerie returns and meets Chad, some of Callahan's men show up. Jimmy kills Chad, and kidnaps Valerie. Stowe returns to the house, and finds Chad's body, along with Jimmy waiting for him.Van Damme promoting the film in 2007Jimmy takes Stowe to a warehouse where Callahan is waiting. Along the way, Stowe manages to overpower Jimmy and take his gun, but he finds that the odds against him are impossible- and Callahan has Valerie hostage. Van Huffel is revealed to be Callahan's mole on the police force, and the sting operation at the beginning of the film was a set-up. Walter suddenly arrives and saves Stowe.

She created the first issues of American Atheist Magazine. O'Hair is best known for the Murray v.

That case came just one year after the Supreme Court prohibited officially sponsored prayer in schools in Engel v.

The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year.\\n\\nIn late 1976, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the 1980s. The Police's early track list was mostly made of Copeland's compositions, including the band's first single \\"Fall Out\\" (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B side \\"Nothing Achieving\\". Though Copeland's songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police's songs with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland's most notable songs are \\"On Any Other Day\\" (where he sang lead vocals too), \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), \\"Contact\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\". Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including \\"Peanuts\\", \\"Landlord\\", \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"Re-Humanize Yourself\\".  Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\\"Don't Care\\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymously titled 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recorded at Nigel Gray's Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent's \\"Don't Care\\", which peaked at #48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", issued in October 1978) as \\"Don't Care\\" was released in early June 1978. In 1982 Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \\"Don't Box Me In\\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)--a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo--that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year.  The Police stopped touring in 1984, and during this brief hiatus he released a solo album, The Rhythmatist. The record was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is \\"A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.\\" (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.)

When Mary increases the temperature inside her greenhouse she causes an increase in rate of movement (kinetic energy) by molecular level or atomic/subatomic particles - thus causing increased rates of evaporation because kinetic energies has been increased making it easier for them to convert into vapors(gaseous state).\\nHence option \\"it would increase\\"is correct answer."},{"source":"Write a question about the following article: In order to keep their season alive, the Panthers were in need of a win against the Bears to qualify for their first 2-2 or above start since 2008.

It encloses the cytoplasm of the cell. It forms a barrier between the cytoplasm and the environment outside the cell. The function of the cell membrane is to protect and support the cell. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. It allows only certain substances to pass through. It keeps other substances inside or outside the cell. The structure of the cell membrane explains how it can control what enters and leaves the cell. The membrane is composed mainly of two layers of phospholipids. Figure 3.8 shows how the phospholipids are arranged in the cell membrane. Each phospholipid molecule has a head and two tails. The heads are water loving (hydrophilic), and the tails are water fearing (hydrophobic). The water-loving heads are on the outer surfaces of the cell membrane. They point toward the watery cytoplasm within the cell or the watery fluid that surrounds the cell. The water-fearing tails are in the middle of the cell membrane. Hydrophobic molecules like to be near other hydrophobic molecules. They fear being near hydrophilic molecules. The opposite is true of hydrophilic molecules. They like to be near other hydrophilic molecules. They fear being near hydrophobic molecules. These likes and fears explain why some molecules can pass through the cell membrane while others cannot. Hydrophobic molecules can pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophobic interior of the membrane and fear the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane. Hydrophilic molecules cant pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane and fear the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. You can see how this works in the video at this link: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Cytoplasm is everything inside the cell membrane (except the nucleus if there is one). It includes the watery, gel-like cytosol. It also includes other structures. The water in the cytoplasm makes up about two-thirds of the cells weight. It gives the cell many of its properties. Why does a cell have cytoplasm? Cytoplasm has several important functions. These include: suspending cell organelles. pushing against the cell membrane to help the cell keep its shape. providing a site for many of the biochemical reactions of the cell. Crisscrossing the cytoplasm is a structure called the cytoskeleton. It consists of thread-like filaments and tubules. The cytoskeleton is like a cellular skeleton. It helps the cell keep its shape. It also holds cell organelles in place within the cytoplasm. Figure 3.9 shows several cells. In the figure, the filaments of their cytoskeletons are colored green. The tubules are colored red. The blue dots are the cell nuclei. Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and several other types of organelles. These structures carry out many vital cell functions. The nucleus is the largest organelle in a eukaryotic cell. It contains most of the cells DNA. DNA, in turn, contains the genetic code. This code tells the cell which proteins to make and when to make them. You can see a diagram of a cell nucleus in Figure 3.10. Besides DNA, the nucleus contains a structure called a nucleolus. Its function is to form ribosomes. The membrane enclosing the nucleus is called the nuclear envelope. The envelope has tiny holes, or pores, in it. The pores allow substances to move into and out of the nucleus. The mitochondrion (mitochondria, plural) is an organelle that makes energy available to the cell. Its like the power plant of a cell. It uses energy in glucose to make smaller molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP packages energy in smaller amounts that cells can use. Think about buying a bottle of water from a vending machine. The machine takes only quarters, and you have only dollar bills. The dollar bills wont work in the vending machine.

Despite their effectiveness, the number of parameters in an embedding layer increases linearly with the number of symbols and poses a critical challenge on memory and storage constraints. In this work, we propose a generic and end-to-end learnable compression framework termed differentiable product quantization (DPQ). We present two instantiations of DPQ that leverage different approximation techniques to enable differentiability in end-to-end learning. Our method can readily serve as a drop-in alternative for any existing embedding layer. Empirically, DPQ offers significant compression ratios (14-238x) at negligible or no performance cost on 10 datasets across three different language tasks.","target":"We propose a differentiable product quantization framework that can reduce the size of embedding layer in an end-to-end training at no performance cost","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose a differentiable product quantization framework that can reduce the size of embedding layer in an end-to-end training at no performance cost."},{"source":"Answer the following question:\\n\\nwhat is the most fundamental source of law in the united states?","target":"The Constitution","rationale":"The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law.

Detroit got an early lead when Matthew Stafford threw a 1-yard TD pass to Calvin Johnson, the only Lions score of the first half. The Packers responded with a TD of their own, a 7-yard toss to Donald Lee. The Packers then kicked 2 field goals: first a 20 yarder and just before halftime a 25 yarder. The Packers scored 2 touchdowns in the 3rd quarter. First a 7-yard catch by Donald Driver, then a 21-yard catch by James Jones. The Lions picked up a safety when the Packers Ryan Grant had his left arm down before he fumbled the ball in their own end zone in the fourth quarter. They then kicked a 22-yard field goal. The Packers sealed their win when Charles Woodson intercepted a Stafford pass and ran it back 38 yards for a touchdown. The Thanksgiving Day losing streak for the Lions is now six, the longest in franchise history. With the loss combined with the Eagles win over the Redskins, the Lions were officially eliminated from postseason contention.  This would also become the Packers' 9th straight victory over the Lions, dating back to the second game between the teams in the 2005 season.\\n\\nHow many more field goals were made in the first half than in the second?","target":"1","rationale":"In the first half, two field goals were made: 20 yarder and 25 yarder.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage:\\nThe severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots.\\nThe very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin.\\nIn order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment.\\nAfter cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.\\n\\nAfter gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them.\\nQuestion: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. for a few hours\\n\\nB. for a few minutes\\n\\nC. not enough information\\n\\nD. for a few days","target":"A","rationale":"The context describes the use of facial masks to treat sun damaged skin. The purpose of a mask is described as drawing out impurities and adding key ingredients into the skin, with no mention that this has to be done quickly or over several days. Therefore, it can be inferred that since people are likely going to apply make up after treatment (as noted in previous sentences), they would want enough time for their face to absorb the moisturisers mentioned before applying makeup products on top.\\nTherefore, A is most likely answer - \\"for a few hours\\""},{"source":"As the rocks move deeper into the Earth, temperature and pressure increase.\\n\\nUlysses pilots his drill ship deep into the Earth's core, then back up.

Recently, the G-308A polymorphism of the TNF-alpha gene has been associated with modified gene expression and increased TNF-alpha production in the -308A allele. We evaluated its influence on the incidence and clinical course of membranous glomerulonephritis.', 'We studied 53 patients with biopsy-proven primary membranous glomerulonephritis followed up for 5.7 +/- 4.9 years. 100 volunteers were analyzed as controls. According to the slope of the curve of reciprocal serum creatinine against time, group A (slow progressors, n = 35) and group B (fast progressors, n = 18) were defined. TNF-alpha G-308A polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification.', 'The frequency of the A-allele (associated with higher TNF-alpha levels) was significantly higher in patients than control subjects (patients: G-allele: 0.66, A-allele: 0.34; controls: G-allele 0.85, A-allele 0.15, p < 0.001). Similarly, the genotype distribution differed significantly between our study and control populations (patients: GG-genotype: 41.5%, GA: 49.1%, AA 9.4%; controls: GG: 71%, GA: 27%, AA 2%, p = 0.001). Age, renal function, proteinuria and blood pressure were similar at the time of renal biopsy between patients with different genotypes (NS). There was also a tendency towards an overpresentation of the A-allele in group B indicating a possible impact on the progression of membranous nephropathy, but a significance was not reached. Furthermore, no impact on renal survival in the Kaplan- Meier analysis was detected (NS).\\\\Question: Is tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene G-308A polymorphism a risk factor for the development of membranous glomerulonephritis?","target":"Our results suggest that TNF-alpha gene G-308A polymorphism is a risk factor for the development of membranous glomerulonephritis","rationale":"The correct answer is: Our results suggest that TNF-alpha gene G-308A polymorphism is a risk factor for the development of membranous glomerulonephritis.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway,...","target":"No","rationale":"The question is asking how Macau was affected by the Portuguese that settled there.

It is here that thymocytes with reactivities to self antigens are eliminated and those with specificities to 'altered' self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products are positively selected. The selections are presumably carried out on the basis of their T-cell antigen receptors (TcR). The genes of the alpha- and beta-chain T-cell antigen receptors have been cloned. A third T-cell specific gene capable of undergoing somatic rearrangement has also been identified; the role of this third gene is not known. An order of expression of gamma, beta, then alpha is found during T-cell ontogeny. But although alpha- and beta-chain messages are often functional, gamma transcripts are rarely functional in thymocytes or mature T cells. To define the sequential order of expression of these genes further and to continue the search for a possible role for the TcR gamma gene products, we investigated the expression of 'functional' alpha-, beta- and gamma-chain transcripts in young athymic mice. These mice express an undetectable amount (less than one in 8 X 10(5) spleen messages) of 'full-length' alpha- and beta-chain T-cell receptor transcripts, but an increased level of expression of 'full-length' gamma chain messages. Nucleotide sequence analysis of four gamma complementary DNAs show that all four gamma transcripts sequenced are functional. These findings suggest that gamma gene products may be important in a prethymic or extrathymic pathway and may represent a second type of T-cell recognition, possibly in a lineage in which alpha and beta genes are not used.","target":"Athymic mice express a high level of functional gamma-chain but greatly reduced levels of alpha- and beta-chain T-cell receptor messages","rationale":"Here's a suggestion:\\\\nAthymic mice express a high level of functional gamma-chain but greatly reduced levels of alpha- and beta-chain T-cell receptor messages."},{"source":"Single/multi-select question: Is it possible to conclude that \\"A group of guys walking down the beach using a medal detector.\\" if \\"The guys are trying to find metal on the beach.\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no...I think the answer is","target":"yes","rationale":"The sentence \\"A group of guys walking down the beach using a medal detector\\" can be concluded from the second sentence \\" The guys are trying to find metal on the beach\\".\\nSo,the answer is yes."},{"source":"Based on the premise \\"A good or service is the product of a process resulting from the consumption of resources.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Different resources may be better suited to producing different goods and services. \\" is true (see options)?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"it is not possible to tell","rationale":"The premise does not provide enough information to conclude that different resources are better suited for producing certain goods and services.

For youth living with HIV, adherence to life-saving treatment regimens are likely to be affected by the complex set of economic and social circumstances that challenge their families and also exacerbate health problems. Using baseline data from the National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) funded Suubi+Adherence study, we examined the extent to which individual and composite measures of equity predict self-reported adherence among Ugandan adolescents aged 10-16 (n = 702) living with HIV. Results showed that greater asset ownership, specifically familial possession of seven or more tangible assets, was associated with greater odds of self-reported adherence (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.00-2.85). Our analyses also indicated that distance to the nearest health clinic impacts youth's adherence to an ARV regimen. Youth who reported living nearest to a clinic were significantly more likely to report optimal adherence (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 0.92-2.40). Moreover, applying the composite equity scores, we found that adolescents with greater economic advantage in ownership of household assets, financial savings, and caregiver employment had higher odds of adherence by a factor of 1.70 (95% CI: 1.07-2.70). These findings suggest that interventions addressing economic and social inequities may be beneficial to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake among economically vulnerable youth, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

Capillaries are known to be heavily recruited in the dependent lung, but there are no direct data that bear on how capillary transit times might be affected by gravity. We directly determined mean capillary transit times on the surface of the upper, middle, and lower lung by measuring the passage of fluorescent dye through the capillaries using in vivo television microscopy. In anesthetized dogs, mean capillary transit times averaged 12.3 s in the upper lung, 3.1 s in the midlung, and 1.6 s in the lower lung. This near order of magnitude variation in speed of blood transit establishes that there is a vertical gradient of capillary transit times in the lung. As expected, dependent capillary networks were nearly fully recruited, whereas relatively few capillaries were perfused in the upper lung. The lengthy transit times and sparsely perfused capillary beds in the upper lung combine to provide a substantial part of pulmonary gas exchange reserve.","target":"Animal","rationale":"The title of the paper is \\"A Vertical Gradient of Capillary Transit Times in the Lung\\", and the abstract describes a study that measured \\"mean capillary transit times on the surface of the upper, middle, and lower lung by measuring the passage of fluorescent dye through the capillaries using in vivo television microscopy\\".

Matthew Paris is a central character in the novel, a physician several years older than his cousin Erasmus. Prior to the beginning of the story Paris had been imprisoned for writings on the age of the earth that clashed with a literal interpretation of the Bible, his wife Ruth dying while he was incarcerated. Wishing to escape his past, he accepts a position as surgeon on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship built and owned by his uncle William Kemp. The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long-standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father. The ship's crew is made up of men available at the time around the Liverpool docks, and many are recruited by blackmail and deception.

The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist, claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void, the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism. As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues, Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics.[aa] While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount, which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government, some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise.[ab] They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism.

Melbourne has one of the largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing, resulting in a vast suburban sprawl, with a high level of car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species, most of European origin, and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox. Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland. The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off. Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne, including the Mornington Peninsula National Park, Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the south east, Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east.

Starting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. The most common name for this new form of music is also \\"folk music\\", but is often called \\"contemporary folk music\\" or \\"folk revival music\\" to make the distinction. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as folk rock, electric folk, and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, it often shares the same English name, performers and venues as traditional folk music; even individual songs may be a blend of the two.\\n\\n- Elektra Records is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group, founded in 1950 by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt. It played an important role in the development of contemporary folk music and rock music between the 1950s and 1970s. In 2004, it was consolidated into WMG's Atlantic Records Group.

With a multibillion-dollar annual turnover, WMG employs in excess of 3,500 people and has operations in more than 50 countries throughout the world.\\n\\n- Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.\\n\\n- Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.\\n\\n- A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.\\n\\n- Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular.\\nIn the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.\\n\\n- Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.\\n\\n- Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.\\n\\n- Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes.\\n\\n- Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.\\n\\n- Krautrock (sometimes called \\"kosmische Musik\\") is a broad genre of experimental rock that developed in Germany in the late 1960s. The term \\"krautrock\\" was originated by English-speaking music journalists as a humorous name for a diverse range of German bands whose music drew from sources such as psychedelic rock, avant-garde electronic music, funk, minimalism, jazz improvisation, and world music styles. Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and new-age music. Important acts of the scene include Can, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Faust.\\n\\n- New wave is a genre of rock music popular from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with ties to 1970s punk rock. New wave moved away from smooth blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop music that incorporated electronic and experimental music, mod and disco. Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct, genre. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synthpop, college rock and gothic rock.\\n\\n- Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008.\\n\\n- Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'record label' with the subject 'machine age voodoo'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- album\\n - atlantic records\\n - country music\\n - elektra records\\n - english\\n - funk\\n - japan\\n - label\\n - pop\\n - record\\n - record label\\n - rock music\\n - sony music entertainment\\n - united kingdom\\n - warner music group","target":"warner music group","rationale":"Machine Age Voodoo is an album by the band SPK.

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols.

After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal.

The group focused on self-education but had ties to a more radical, clearly pro-Polish-independence student group, the Filaret Association. An investigation of secret student organizations by Nikolay Novosiltsev, begun in early 1823, led to the arrests of a number of students and ex-student activists including Mickiewicz, who was taken into custody and imprisoned at Vilnius' Basilian monastery in late 1823 or early 1824 (sources disagree as to the date). After investigation into his political activities, specifically his membership in the Philomaths, in 1824 Mickiewicz was banished to central Russia. Within a few hours of receiving the decree on 22 October 1824, he penned a poem into an album belonging to Salomea Bécu, the mother of Juliusz Słowacki. (In 1975 this poem was set to music in Polish and Russian by Soviet composer David Tukhmanov.) Mickiewicz crossed the border into Russia about 11 November 1824, arriving in Saint Petersburg later that month. He would spend most of the next five years in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, except for a notable 1824 to 1825 excursion to Odessa, then on to Crimea. That visit, from February to November 1825, inspired a notable collection of sonnets (some love sonnets, and a series known as Crimean Sonnets, published a year later).\\n Link Information: The Filaret Association (also translated as filaret(e)s, philaret(e)s; , Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Pożytecznej Zabawy, filareci; from the Greek philáretos, \\"lovers of virtue\\") was a secret student organization created in 1820 by Tomasz Zan Answer: 1820","target":"When was the Filaret Association created?","rationale":"The question should be able to use the link information to obtain the answer.

It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for pendant jewelry.\\n\\n- Sonata (Italian: , pl. \\"sonate\\"; from Latin and Italian: \\"sonare\\", \\"to sound\\"), in music, literally means a piece \\"played\\" as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\"), a piece \\"sung\\". The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and is vague. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regardedalongside the fugueas one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure.\\n\\n- DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system.\\n\\n- DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS.\\n\\n- The game was highly popular for Namco upon its release, and has been a focus of competitive gaming ever since. It spawned a successful sequel, \\"Galaga\\", in 1981, and the lesser known \\"Gaplus\\" and \\"Galaga '88\\" in 1984 and 1987 respectively, as well as many later ports and adaptations. Along with its immediate sequel, it was one of the most popular games during the golden age of arcade video games.\\n\\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\\n\\n- A trilogy (from Greek - \\"\\", \\"three\\" and - \\"-logia\\", \\"discourse\\") is a set of three works of art that are connected, and that can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works. They are commonly found in literature, film, or video games. Three-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, such as the triptych or the three-movement sonata, but they are not commonly referred to with the term \\"trilogy.\\"\\n\\n- Namco was a front-runner during the golden age of arcade video games. \\"Pac-Man\\" went on to become the best-selling arcade game in history and an international popular culture icon. Namco was also known for creating successful franchises such as \\"Galaxian\\", \\"Ridge Racer\\", \\"Ace Combat\\", \\"Tekken\\", as well as the \\"Soul\\" and \\"Tales\\" series.\\n\\n- x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.\\n\\n- \\"Galaga\\" is one of the most commercially and critically successful games from the golden age of arcade video games. The arcade version of it has been ported to many consoles, and it has had several sequels. In 2011, the game celebrated its 30th anniversary with the release of \\"Galaga 30th Collection\\" for iOS.\\n\\n- MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.\\n\\n- Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\\n\\n- The golden age of arcade video games was the era of greatest popularity and technological innovation for arcade video games. The exact time period is a matter of debate, but key moments include the release of \\"Space Invaders\\" in 1978 and the introduction of vector display technology in 1979. The golden age lasted until the late 1980s, when home video game consoles like the NES were introduced.\\n\\n- Kiloblaster is a space shooter video game trilogy written by Allen Pilgrim and published by Epic MegaGames in 1992 . It is based on the classic Galaxian game , with a few differences such as allowing greater player movement ( up and down as well as left and right ) , much faster enemy movement , power - ups , enemies that take more than one hit , and allies to assist in battle . It runs under MS - DOS , and took advantage of the still relatively new 256 - colour VGA standard , although like Jill of the Jungle before it , a 16 - colour EGA mode was also selectable in version 1.0 . Running in 256 - colour mode would place many obviously computer - generated backgrounds behind the main game levels , something common in games of this era keen to show off their graphical capabilities . The game also has Adlib music ( in CMF format ) and Sound Blaster sound effects . Allen Pilgrim declared the registered version freeware and released also the source code on August 4 , 2008 .\\n\\n- There are few known ports of this game. It appears on some multi-game cartridges, which were released long after its arcade release. It was ported to the Sony PlayStation in 1996 as one of the games featured in \\"Namco Museum Volume 2\\", using its original name, \\"Gaplus\\". It was also released on mobile phones with its \\"Galaga 3\\" title, and is also part of the \\"Namco Museum Remix\\" (2007) and \\"Namco Museum Megamix\\" (2010) for the Wii with its original title being used. The original version was later re-released under its original name for the Wii Virtual Console Arcade on March 25, 2009 in North America, at a cost of 600 Wii Points (500 Wii Points in Europe and Australia).\\n\\n- The backgrounds for Stages 1517 (the fourth block of stages) consist of the green hexagonal space stations first seen in the 1981 Namco game \\"Bosconian\\".

They often show clinical symptoms only after hepatic metastasation when curative therapy is limited or impossible. In this study, we analyzed the expression of the candidate genes mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), and death domain-associated protein (DAXX) to investigate the specific oncogenetics and potential therapeutic options for ileal NETs.', 'In a prospective database, all patients who underwent surgical removal of a NET of the ileum between 2001 and 2011 were specified. Expression analysis was performed for mTOR, ATRX, and DAXX by immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded tumor samples. To evaluate the results the immunoreactive score was applied. Normal tissue and tumor tissue were analyzed for the comparison of gene expression levels using quantitative-real-time polymerase chain reaction for ATRX and mTOR genes. Results were correlated under pathologic and clinical aspects.', 'A total of 69 patients were admitted to the study. Positive cytosolic expression of the potential oncogene mTOR was immunohistochemically detected in 76.2% of the human probes. A loss of nuclear ATRX expression was detected in 13.0% of the samples. A nonexpression of the DAXX-protein in cell nuclei was not found (0%). Gene transcript levels did not show a significant alteration in ileal NETs in comparison with normal tissue.\\nAnswer: mTOR is overexpressed in ileal NETs. Additionally, the loss of ATRX expression was registered, thus underlying a tumorigenic role in a subgroup of these tumors. To enable potential therapeutic application of mTOR inhibitors, further trials with larger study groups are needed.","target":"Do ileal neuroendocrine tumors show elevated activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex?","rationale":"The question, \\"Do ileal neuroendocrine tumors show elevated activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex?\\", can be answered correctly using the information in the given passage.

The Bengals dominated the first half time of possession by more than a 2-1 margin. The Bengals took the opening possession of the game and marched down the field, with quarterback AJ McCarron, playing in place of the injured Andy Dalton, throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver A. J. Green in the corner of the end zone. The Bengals later added to their lead in the second quarter, with wide receiver Mohamed Sanu rushing for a 6-yard touchdown, in a \\"wildcat\\" formation. The Bengals were threatening to add to their lead just before the two-minute warning, but placekicker Mike Nugent missed wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus just before halftime. The Broncos took the initial possession of the second half, and pulled to within 14-10, with quarterback Brock Osweiler connecting with wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders on an 8-yard touchdown pass, which was the only scoring play of the third quarter. After having trouble stopping the Bengals' offense in the first half, the Broncos' defense forced the Bengals to punt on their first four possessions of the second half. The Broncos grabbed a 17-14 lead early in the fourth quarter, with running back C. J. Anderson scampering down the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown. A 52-yard field goal by Nugent helped the Bengals tie the game at 17-17 with 6:51 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Broncos had reached the Bengals' 27-yard line on the next possession, and were attempting a game-winning drive, but Bengals' defensive end Michael Johnson forced a fumble off Anderson, which was recovered by safety Reggie Nelson. However, the Broncos' defense forced a Bengals' punt, and the Broncos' offense began their next drive at their own 20-yard line with 1:40 remaining. However, McManus badly missed wide left on a potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt as time expired, sending the game to overtime. The Broncos won the overtime coin toss, and took a 20-17 lead on their initial possession, with a 37-yard field goal by McManus. The drive was aided by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Bengals' linebacker Vontaze Burfict for a late hit out-of-bounds. The Bengals started their first offensive possession of overtime at their own 33-yard line, and on their first play, McCarron attempted a pass that was incomplete, as his arm was hit by Broncos' linebacker Von Miller. Broncos' head coach Gary Kubiak called a timeout, thinking the play should have been ruled as a game-ending fumble, however, the initial ruling was upheld by instant replay. On the very next play, McCarron fumbled the snap, which was recovered by Broncos' linebacker DeMarcus Ware to end the game and send the Broncos to the postseason for the fifth consecutive season. This was the third game of the season that the Broncos won after trailing 14-0 &#8212; the other two were Week 2 at the Kansas City Chiefs and Week 12 vs. the New England Patriots.\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: How many field goals did McManus make in total?","target":"2","rationale":"The question is asking how many field goals did McManus make in total.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.\\n\\n- The Colorado Avalanche are a professional ice hockey team based in Denver, Colorado.

Barrie was a real estate & resort developer in the Victoria BC area . At one time he was the major partner in the Bear Mountain Resort development in Langford municipality . Bear Mountain includes the Bear Mountain Westin Hotel , golf course , and housing ( single family homes and condominiums ) . The apparent success of the Bear Mountain venture prompted the NHL Board of Governors , on June 18 , 2008 , to approve the sale of the Tampa Bay Lightning to an investment group which included Len Barrie and movie producer Oren Koules . It was alleged that Barrie and Koules began to disagree on team management issues , that were believed to include NHL superstar Vincent Lecavalier being traded . This became such a problem that NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman had to intervene and have a meeting with the two owners . Both were given the opportunity to buy the other out . Neither exercised that option and the team was later sold to Jeff Vinik , a minority owner of the Boston Red Sox . The development of Bear Mountain resort has been criticized for damaging sensitive ecosystems and historic native sites .

Previous studies suggested that HIV infection impaired the natural course of chronic hepatitis C, with a more rapid progression to cirrhosis. However, these studies did not assess the HIV infection impact on chronic hepatitis C by taking into account the risk factors for liver fibrosis progression: alcohol, sex, age at the contamination, and duration of HCV infection. We studied liver biopsy specimens of 2 groups of 58 patients that were infected by both HCV and HIV or by HCV alone. The 2 groups were matched according those risk factors, and liver biopsy responses were evaluated with the METAVIR items. The METAVIR activity was higher in HIV-positive than HIV-negative patients. Cirrhosis was more frequent: (1) in HIV-positive patients with CD4 < or = 200 cells/microL (45%) than in HIV-negative patients (10%) (P = .003), (2) in HIV-positive patients with CD4 < or = 200 cells/microL (45%) than in HIV-positive patients with CD4 > 200 cells/microL (17%) (P = .04).

Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.\\n\\nParagraph: Two botanists studied different types of plants.
