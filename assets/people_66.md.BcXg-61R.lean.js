We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey.\\nIt wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack.\\nWith the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.\\nHow does Simona feel about the author's visit?\\n- she is happy to see them\\n- she hopes they leave soon\\n- she is annoyed that they came\\n- not enough information","target":"she is happy to see them","rationale":"It can be inferred from the passage that Simona is happy to see the author.

Passage 1:As a youth, Quinn had preferred Gaelic football and hurling to soccer. It was not until he was fourteen that he began to play the game regularly in the Down & Connor League with Corpus Christi Youth Club and Blessed Oliver Plunkett Youth Club (Now St. Oliver Plunkett FC). In 1978, he began his playing career with Larne F.C. In 1979, he signed with Everton F.C. between 1979 and 1981, but spent his entire time on the reserve squad. In 1981, Quinn moved to the US to join the Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League. When the Aztecs folded at the end of the season, he moved to the Montreal Manic for 1982 and 1983 outdoor seasons. The Manic folded at the end of the 1983 season, and Quinn signed with the San Diego Sockers as they prepared for the 1983–1984 NASL indoor season. In 1984, he played the last NASL season with the Sockers. In the fall of 1984, the Sockers jumped to the Major Indoor Soccer League as the NASL collapsed.

So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like...\\" After filming Selena, Lopez was \\"really feeling [her] Latin roots\\" and recorded a demo record in Spanish. Her manager sent the song (\\"Vivir Sin Ti\\") to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, which was interested in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label, suggested that she sing in English and she began recording her debut album, On the 6. Her decision to launch a musical career was seen as a risk, as film stars had a \\"patchy record\\" when it came to releasing pop music, and \\"If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez but it might even damage her career.\\" Lopez originally believed that \\"Feelin' So Good\\" was to be released as the album's lead single. \\"If You Had My Love\\" was produced by Rodney Jerkins; Lopez recorded her vocals for the song at Sony Music Studios in New York City with engineers Franklyn Grant and Robb Williams.

We met in our seventh grade band class, and this story takes place primarily in our junior year of college, so we'd known each other a long time by this point. Val was my absolute best friend - she called my parents \\"Mama\\" and \\"Daddy,\\" and we'd taken her on a family trip to Cancun with us during mine and Val's senior year of high school. We were basically inseparable, to the point that our teachers would get us mixed up sometimes, even though she is a blonde, white girl, and I'm Indian. \\n\\nTodd and I had a somewhat different dynamic, we communicated mostly through sassing and sniping at one another, especially in high school. However, Todd and I went to the same college, and Val went to one about an hour away from ours. During the first two years of undergrad, Todd and I became very good friends - we lived in buildings right next to each other, and I felt comfortable with him. We were both in the same major, so we spent a reasonable amount of time together without Val around. \\n\\nDuring the summer between my second and third year of undergrad, I came down with horrible stomach/intestinal pains. I could barely eat, I had headaches and issues sleeping, and I constantly felt panicked. The doctors said it was acid reflux, which in hindsight doesn't make any sense, but nothing they gave me helped. As I learned later, it was my anxiety manifesting itself in IBS, but from early August through mid-October, I had no idea what was really happening to me or why. It was during this time that I realized that I had feelings for Todd. Maybe it was because we texted every day and his presence in that capacity comforted me, or maybe it just happened that way, but there it was. I couldn't keep a secret from Val for more than thirty seconds, so of course I immediately told her. She had expressed the idea that we would be cute together several times in the past nine years (and many others had mistaken us for dating), so she seemed happy about it. Nevertheless, I was simply feeling too awful at the time to really deal with my feelings - I had an extremely intense course load that semester, and most nights I could hardly sleep due to my yet-undiagnosed anxiety. Val was having a difficult time in school as well, her texts conveying a difficult course load, as well as dissatisfaction with her friends. \\n\\nOne week, she was so miserable that I convinced Todd to drive us both down to her college for the day as a surprise, and went down to spend the day with her, despite having slept all of 20 minutes the night before. At that point, I didn't mind because I would have done anything for her because she was my best friend. The whole day, though, I couldn't shake the feeling that she was basically ignoring me for Todd. I'm generally not a sensitive person, and with everything else going on, I shook off the uneasiness. About two or three weeks later, however, she texted me an essay about how she had feelings for Todd, and she knew I did, too, and that she was sorry about it. I had kind of started to suspect something along those lines before the messages, based on her behavior during our trip and the time a few weeks before that when she was visiting us and did pretty much the same thing. I told her that people couldn't help their feelings, and I didn't want anything to ruin our friendship. I lied. I was *pissed* as anything. I mean, her school had how many thousands of guys? And she had to like the one guy in our entire 9 years of friendship that I had feelings for? But, I really didn't want to ruin our friendship (and I was on some good anxiety meds by then), so I let it go. I was an idiot. \\n\\nAbout two days before winter break ended (about two months later, for reference), she texted me that she had something to tell me, and that \\"I wouldn't like it.\\" At that point, I figured that Todd had asked her out, and that she'd said no, or wanted to ask if it was alright with me, or something. **Wrong*****.*** She was texting to tell me that Todd had, in fact, asked her out, but she'd actually said yes. Fun times. On some level, I could accept that. Her friendship meant a lot to me (even though it was now clear that mine didn't mean as much to her), but I just wanted to know why. Why she would potentially throw away our friendship and my trust to date him. She didn't have an answer for me. I called her because I wanted to talk about it, and she just cried for an entire hour before I felt so shitty about being angry that I had to hang up. I didn't curse at her or anything (I parked my car in an abandoned parking lot and screamed alone for an hour to get it out beforehand), but I definitely wanted to know *why*. And she didn't have an answer, and that made me increasingly angry. I asked her why she would choose him over me, and she just asked me why it had to be a choice. (I have all the texts, but I don't know if you guys want to read them, I can post them if you do.) She basically kept telling me and implying that I was overreacting.  I still wanted to fix our friendship though, and Todd and I had a class next semester, so I decided to just try to make my peace with it. \\n\\nUnfortunately, 'twas not to be. I saw Todd on the first day back, and I asked him how his vacation was. He hadn't messaged me about asking Val out, and I wanted to see if he would tell me. He just made several awkward, panicked faces before mumbling out an excuse and literally running away. I figured he might have somewhere to be, and knew I'd see him the next day in class. He's a leftie, so he usually sits on the left end of the aisle, and I sit in the right handed seat next to him. As I walked into class, he was in his seat, but when he looked over and saw me coming in, he put his backpack on the seat next to him. Message received. \\n\\nLater that day, I called Val to ask what was up with him, and she told me that he might be a bit awkward because *she told him that I liked him*. Without my permission, she decided to tell something that I told her in confidence to the one person I didn't want to know about it! That was basically the moment that both of those friendships ended for me. I tried to fight it - I went up to Todd before class one day and told him it was fine, that I was over him, and that we could just be friends and that was perfectly okay (it didn't fix things), and I made efforts to talk to Val, but I didn't trust her any more, and I couldn't fix that. Before all this, I was always the one who texted her first, and she texted back somewhere within 24 hours. After, I eventually stopped texting first, and I didn't really volunteer any personal information about my life because I simply didn't trust her any more. \\n\\nIt has been a year since all of this happened, and I've been reflecting a lot about everything that happened.

Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.\\nAt a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.\\nThe incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial.

Weber's law predicts the delta R50 (the added load detectable on 50% of presentations) to be a fixed percent of the background resistance (R0) and thus the delta R50/R0 ratio (the Weber fraction) is constant. We have noted the nose to be sensitive to added load, we wondered if the nose might play a role in RLD. To determine whether this was true and to characterize the effects of changes in R0 in the range of normal nasal resistance (RN), we determined R0 and delta R50 using standard techniques under the following conditions: nose vs. decongested nose, nose vs. nose with added external R0 (3.0 and 8.0 cmH2O X l-1 X s), nose vs. anesthetized nose, nose vs. mouth, and mouth vs. mouth with added load (3 cmH2O X l-1 X s). We found that decongestant decreased RN [4.3 +/- 0.6 (SE) to 3.1 +/- 0.5 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05] and delta R50 (1.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05). When an external load of 3 cmH2O X l-1 X s was added to the nose, delta R50 did not change significantly (1.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s), but the Weber fraction decreased (0.28 +/- 0.05 to 0.15 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","target":"Adult","rationale":"The paper \\"Respiration During Sleep in Normal Adults\\" studies the role of nose and mouth breathing on added load detection (RLD) by examining adult subjects.

The plasma levels and hepatic uptake of the steroids dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, estradiol, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were assessed. Systemic plasma levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone were significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced, whereas those of androstenedione, estrone, and estradiol were significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated in men with alcoholic cirrhosis when compared to controls. Sex hormone binding globulin levels were also significantly elevated (p less than 0.01). The hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the degree of liver function impairment as shown by the linear significant relationship between their hepatic extractions and that of indocyanine green (r = 0.74-0.92, p less than 0.05; except for dihydrotestosterone, r = 0.17, not significant). In addition, the hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the binding affinity to sex hormone binding globulin. The higher the affinity for sex hormone binding globulin, the lower the hepatic uptake influenced by liver function impairment. It was estimated that hepatic clearances accounted for only 20%-50% of the metabolic clearance of sex steroids. No significant relationship between plasma levels of sex steroids and their hepatic clearance was found. We show here that in alcoholic cirrhosis the extent of hepatic uptake of sex steroids depends partly on the degree of liver function impairment and partly on the degree to which they are bound to sex hormone binding globulin. Production rate or peripheral metabolism, or both, rather than hepatic uptake alone may account for the altered circulating levels of sex steroids.","target":"Hepatic uptake of sex steroids in men with alcoholic cirrhosis","rationale":"The title should set the focus of the paper to hepatic uptake of sex steroids in men with alcoholic cirrhosis.

The 137th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 16, 2005. In the episode, Stan joins Scientology in an attempt to find something \\"fun and free\\". After the discovery of his surprisingly high \\"thetan levels\\", he is recognized as the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the church.\\n\\nSouth Park had previously parodied Scientology in a spoof at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. The MTV short was titled \\"The Gauntlet\\" and included \\"John Travolta and the Church of Scientology\\" arriving in a spaceship to defeat Russell Crowe (as a gladiator) and attempt to recruit the boys into Scientology. Travolta, along with his fellow Scientologists, was depicted as a Psychlo, as he appeared in the film Battlefield Earth. They had also made fun of Scientology in an earlier episode, titled \\"Super Best Friends\\", in which David Blaine formed his own cult, called \\"Blaintology\\". Parker and Stone have acknowledged that this is meant to be a reference to Scientology.  Parker stated that Isaac Hayes' membership had previously kept the show's creators from writing a full episode which parodies Scientology. However, the decision to ultimately produce a South Park episode satirizing Scientology was partially inspired by the friendship the show's creators have with Penn Jillette. Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of Bullshit! based on Scientology, but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology.

A Comedy Central spokesman told Radar magazine in November 2005 that \\"they are free, and have been, to satirize anybody and anything they want to.

Ebner had previously authored The New York Times best seller Hollywood, Interrupted, which includes an analysis of the Church of Scientology and its effects on the culture in Hollywood, and has a chapter on Tom Cruise and John Travolta's relationship to Scientology. On the official Comedy Central website for the South Park episode, it is asserted that the section of \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" that explains Scientology's portrayal and beliefs was not exaggerated: \\"Nothing about what you see here is exaggerated in the slightest.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]\\n\\nDescending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]\\n\\nParagraph: Two villages are inhabited by lots of people that ride bicycles.

In conclusion based on given information we can infer correctly answer is “Hill” because their"},{"source":"Background: Kurtis Eugene Warner (born June 22, 1971) is a former American football quarterback. He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history.\\nContext: Prior to the 1999 free-agency period, the Rams chose Warner to be one of the team's five unprotected players in the 1999 NFL Expansion Draft. Warner went unselected by the Cleveland Browns, who chose no Rams and whose only quarterback selection was Scott Milanovich.  The Rams let Bono leave in free agency and signed Trent Green to be the starter. Banks was traded to the Ravens, and Warner now found himself second on the depth chart. After Green tore his ACL in a preseason game, Rams coach Dick Vermeil named Warner as the Rams' starter. In an emotional press conference, Vermeil--who hadn't seen Warner work with the first-string offense--said, \\"We will rally around Kurt Warner, and we'll play good football.\\" With the support of running back Marshall Faulk and wide receivers Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Az-Zahir Hakim, and Ricky Proehl, Warner put together one of the top seasons by a quarterback in NFL history, throwing for 4,353 yards with 41 touchdown passes and a completion rate of 65.1%. The Rams' high-powered offense, run by offensive coordinator Mike Martz, was nicknamed \\"The Greatest Show on Turf\\" and registered the first in a string of three consecutive 500-point seasons, an NFL record.  Warner threw three touchdown passes in each of his first three NFL starts; he is the only NFL quarterback in history to accomplish that feat. Warner drew more attention in the Rams' fourth game of the season, a home game against the San Francisco 49ers (who had been NFC West division champions for 12 of the previous 13 seasons). The Rams had lost their last 17 meetings with the 49ers, but Warner proceeded to throw a touchdown pass on each of the Rams' first three possessions of the game, and four touchdowns in the first half alone, to propel the Rams to a 28-10 halftime lead on the way to a 42-20 victory. Warner finished the game with five touchdown passes, giving him 14 in four games and the Rams a 4-0 record. Warner's breakout season from a career in anonymity was so unexpected that Sports Illustrated featured him on their October 18 cover with the caption \\"Who Is This Guy?\\" He was named the 1999 NFL MVP at the season's end for leading the Rams to their first playoff berth since 1989 (when they were still in Los Angeles) and their first division title since 1985.  In the NFL playoffs, Warner ultimately led the Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV against the Tennessee Titans. In the game, he threw for two touchdowns and a then Super Bowl-record 414 passing yards, including a 73-yard touchdown to Isaac Bruce when the game was tied with just over two minutes to play, which proved to be the game-winning score. Warner also set a Super Bowl record by attempting 45 passes without a single interception. For his performance, Warner was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award.\\nQuestion: Did they go to the playoffs.

One of the more famous examples is Playboy's inaugural December 1953 issue that featured photos of Marilyn Monroe from a 1949 photo session as its first Playmate of the Month. The commercialization, promotion, and organized supply of nude celebrity images can be traced to another men's magazine, High Society, and the efforts of its first female Editor, Gloria Leonard. This began as a feature that showcased risqué photos of celebrities like Jodie Foster and Goldie Hawn, usually lifted from film stills, and became a spin-off venture of High Society called Celebrity Skin magazine in 1986. Over its twenty-five year run Margot Kidder, Ann-Margret and Barbra Streisand unsuccessfully attempted to sue the magazine after it published nude photos of them. Yet another magazine earned additional notoriety for its publication of nude photographs of models who at the time were not celebrities, but later attained fame. Penthouse magazine published nude photos in its September 1984 issue of a young adult film actress, Traci Lords (later found to be underage at the time), and Vanessa Williams, then-Miss America, that caused her to be stripped of her crown.\\n Links: a.

Undaunted, Ashley tells him the problem is serious and that she wishes to examine the animal's carcass and the area where it became sick. Hansen escorts Ashley to Colby's farm; and moments after they arrive, Colby's wife, Birch, discovers their dog is also mysteriously dead. Ashley performs a quick chemical test on the dog's carcass and concludes that like the calf, it died from a massive injection of spider venom. Hansen is incredulous, until Colby states that he recently found a massive \\"spider hill\\" on a back section of his farmland. He takes Hansen and Ashley to the hill, which is covered with tarantulas.

He is specifically studying three species, species A, species B, and species C. Species A is a predator; species B is the prey; and species C is a plant species that species B lives on. Mike now needs to figure out how the predator prey relationship balance the ecosystem.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nIf species A population increase, would species C population increase or decrease?\\n\\nHint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.","target":"increase","rationale":"If species A population increase, the population of its prey will decrease.

They do not return to their original shape. If the rocks experience more stress, they may undergo more folding or even fracture. You can see three types of folds. A monocline is a simple bend in the rock layers so that they are no longer horizontal (see Figure 1.1 for an example). At Utahs Cockscomb, the rocks plunge downward in a monocline. What you see in the image appears to be a monocline. Are you certain it is a monocline? What else might it be? What would you have to do to figure it out? Anticline: An anticline is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from the center of the fold (Figure 1.2). The oldest rocks are at the center of an anticline and the youngest are draped over them. When rocks arch upward to form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is sliced off, where are the oldest rocks located? A syncline is a fold that bends downward. The youngest rocks are at the center and the oldest are at the outside (Figure 1.3). When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, that structure is called a basin (Figure 1.4).

For some of these genes, expression is up-regulated under water stress. The aim of this study was to investigate expression and characterization of TaPP2Ac-1 from Triticum aestivum, and to evaluate the effects of TaPP2Ac-1 on Nicotiana benthamiana in response to water stress.', 'TaPP2Ac-1 cDNA was isolated from wheat by in silico identification and RT-PCR amplification. Transcript levels of TaPP2Ac-1 were examined in wheat responding to water deficit. Copy numbers of TaPP2Ac-1 in wheat genomes and subcellular localization in onion epidermal cells were studied. Enzyme properties of the recombinant TaPP2Ac-1 protein were determined. In addition, studies were carried out in tobacco plants with pCAPE2-TaPP2Ac-1 under water-deficit conditions.', 'TaPP2Ac-1 cDNA was cloned from wheat. Transcript levels of TaPP2Ac-1 in wheat seedlings were up-regulated under drought condition. One copy for this TaPP2Ac-1 was present in each of the three wheat genomes. TaPP2Ac-1 fused with GFP was located in the nucleus and cytoplasm of onion epidermis cells. The recombinant TaPP2Ac-1 gene was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and encoded a functional serine/threonine phosphatase. Transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing TaPP2Ac-1 exhibited stronger drought tolerance than non-transgenic tobacco plants.\\nAnswer: Tobacco plants with pCAPE2-TaPP2Ac-1 appeared to be resistant to water deficit, as shown by their higher capacity to maintain leaf relative water content, leaf cell-membrane stability index, water-retention ability and water use efficiency under water stress. The results suggest that the physiological role of TaPP2Ac-1 is related to drought stress response, possibly through its involvement in drought-responding signal transduction pathways.","target":"Does a wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit gene provide enhanced drought tolerance in tobacco?","rationale":"The given answer mentions the specific gene (TaPP2Ac-1) which is investigated.

The number of high-affinity rosette-forming cells (HARFC) was found to be significantly decreased in OSMF and oral cancer, whereas the number of total rosette-forming cells (TRFC) remained unaltered.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase.

Thus, if species A were to expand its territory into new areas with low producer density (e.g., greater distances from existing territories), a local increase in predation pressure can cause increased growth rates for locally abundant producers through reduced herbivore grazing pressure on those individuals remaining within one trophic level above the apex consumer(s) ["},{"source":"In this task, you are given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences where the second sentence is missing.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor.

Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. Many modern trombone models also utilize a rotary valve as a means to lower pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves like those on the trumpet.\\n\\n- A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. \\n\\n- Don Lang ( born Gordon Langhorn , 19 January 1925 -- 3 August 1992 ) was an English trombone player and singer , who led his own band , Don Lang & his Frantic Five .\\n\\n- The embouchure is the use of facial muscles and the shaping of the lips to the mouthpiece of woodwind instruments or the mouthpiece of the brass instruments. The word is of French origin and is related to the root \\"bouche\\" (fr.), 'mouth'. The proper embouchure allows the instrumentalist to play the instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to one's muscles.\\n\\n- A brass instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis and autoradiography of purified receptor, radioiodinated receptor, and affinity-labeled receptor all indicated a molecular mass of approximately 250K.

Passage 1:After leaving the Academy, German continued to teach at Wimbledon School and to play the violin in orchestras at various London theatres, including the Savoy. In 1888, an introduction by conductor Alberto Randegger to theatre manager Richard Mansfield led to German's appointment as conductor and musical director at the Globe Theatre in London. There he improved the orchestra and began providing incidental music for the theatre's lavish productions, starting with Richard III in 1889. This music was well received (The Times called for a concert suite to be arranged), and the overture soon became popular in concert halls. This eventually led to other incidental music commissions that gained success. In 1892, German composed music for a production of Henry Irving's version of Henry VIII at the Lyceum Theatre, London, where he incorporated elements of traditional old English dance. Within a year, sheet music of the dance numbers from the play's score had sold 30,000 copies. German was by then in great demand to write music for plays. His commissions included Henry Arthur Jones's The Tempter in 1893, Johnston Forbes-Robertson's Romeo and Juliet at the Lyceum in 1895, Herbert Beerbohm Tree's productions of As You Like It (1896) and Much Ado about Nothing (1898), and Anthony Hope's English Nell (later known as Nell Gwynn) in 1900, starring Marie Tempest.\\n Passage 2:The Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is one of the largest salamanders and one of the largest amphibians in the world. It is fully aquatic and is endemic to rocky mountain streams and lakes in the Yangtze river basin of central China. Either it or a close relative has been introduced to Kyoto Prefecture in Japan and Taiwan. It is considered critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, pollution, and overcollection, as it is considered a delicacy and used in traditional Chinese medicine. On farms in central China, it is extensively farmed and sometimes bred, although many of the salamanders on the farms are caught in the wild. It has been listed as one of the top-10 \\"focal species\\" in 2008 by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered project. The Chinese giant salamander is considered to be a \\"living fossil\\". Although protected under Chinese law and CITES Appendix I, the wild population has declined by more than an estimated 80% since the 1950s. Although traditionally recognized as one of two living species of Andrias salamander in Asia, the other being the Japanese giant salamander, evidence indicates that the Chinese giant salamander may be composed of at least five cryptic species, further compounding each individual species' endangerment.\\n Passage 3:In 1962, the Belgian mandate of Ruanda-Urundi received independence, creating the Republic of Rwanda and the Kingdom of Burundi. Both states had traditionally had monarchies dominated by the Tutsi ethnic group over a Hutu ethnic majority but Rwanda's monarchy was abolished by a political revolution in 1959-61. In the first years of independence, Burundi seemed to have achieved a balance between ethnic groups which brought members of the different ethnic groups into government, moderated in part by the mwami (king) Mwambutsa IV who was popular with all groups but was himself Tutsi. Both Tutsi, Hutu and Ganwa were part of the dominant political party, the Union for National Progress (Union pour le Progrès national, UPRONA). In October 1961, shortly before the date scheduled for independence, the Burundian Prime Minister Prince Louis Rwagasore was assassinated, raising ethnic tensions in the country. After a period of rule by Tutsi prime ministers, Mwambutsa appointed Burundi's first Hutu leader, Pierre Ngendandumwe, but Ngendandumwe was assassinated in January 1965 by a Rwandan Tutsi. Elections held in May 1965 took place in an atmosphere of strong ethnic tension. Hutu candidates gained a majority, but Mwambutsa deposed the Hutu Prime Minister Joseph Bamina and instead installed a Tutsi candidate, Léopold Biha, in October 1965.","target":"3","rationale":"Passage 3 mentions that Rwanda had a capital, and it was likely different from the one used in Burundi, which is why it can be used to answer the question."},{"source":"Given a goal and 2 solutions, choose the most appropriate solution.\\nGoal: how do you add a friend by snapcode on snapchat?\\n- Solution 1: draw the snapcode into the snapcode section of snapchat.\\n- Solution 2: take a screenshot or a picture of the snapcode on your phone.\\n\\nAnswer by returning either Solution 1 or Solution 2","target":"Solution 2","rationale":"You can add a friend by snapcode on Snapchat.

Aquaman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941). Initially a backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series.\\n\\nAquaman's adventures continued to be published in Adventure Comics through the 1940s and 1950s, as one of the few superheroes to last through the 1950s in continuous publication. Starting in the late 1950s, new elements to Aquaman's backstory were introduced, with various new supporting characters added and several adjustments made to the character, his origins, his powers, and persona. The first of these elements was the story \\"Aquaman's Undersea Partner\\" in Adventure Comics #229 (October 1956), where his octopus sidekick, Topo, was first introduced. This and subsequent elements were later, after the establishment of DC's multiverse in the 1960s, attributed to the Aquaman of Earth-One.  In Adventure Comics #260 (May 1959) and subsequent Silver Age comics, it was revealed that Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of Tom Curry, a lighthouse keeper, and Atlanna, a water-breathing outcast from the lost, underwater city of Atlantis. Due to his heritage, Aquaman discovers as a youth that he possesses various superhuman abilities, including the powers of surviving underwater, communication with sea life, and tremendous swimming prowess. Eventually, Arthur decided to use his talents to become the defender of the Earth's oceans. It was later revealed that he had, in his youth, adventured as Aquaboy and on one occasion, met Superboy, Earth's only other publicly active superpowered hero at the time. When Arthur grew up, he called himself \\"Aquaman\\".  It was later revealed that after Atlanna's death, Tom Curry met and married an ordinary human woman and had a son named Orm Curry, Aquaman's half-brother. Orm grew up as a troubled youth in the shadow of his brother, who constantly bailed him out of trouble with the law. He grew to hate Aquaman not only for the powers that he could never possess but also because he believed that their father would always favor Aquaman. Orm disappeared after becoming an amnesiac and would resurface years later as Aquaman's nemesis, Ocean Master.  Aquaman's ability to talk with fish eventually expanded to full-fledged telepathic communication with sea creatures even from great distances. He also retroactively developed a specific weakness akin to Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite or Green Lantern's vulnerability to the color yellow: Aquaman had to come into contact with water at least once per hour, or he would die.

The infusion rate of 0.6 mumol/min/100 gm body weight of TU caused significantly higher bile flow and BSP Tm values compared with the respective control values in rats with only a BSP infusion. These values, however, were significantly lower than values obtained by an equimolar infusion of taurocholate (TC). The higher infusion rates of TU (1.2 and 1.8 mumol/min/100 gm) tended to cause higher bile flow rates, but the BSP Tm value did not increase beyond the value obtained at the lower infusion rate (0.6 mumol/min/100 gm). In the highest TU infusion rate study (1.8 mumol/min/100 gm), plasma BSP concentrations were significantly higher than corresponding control values or values at a lower TU or TC infusion rate. It was concluded that in rats TU can significantly increase the BSP Tm, but to a lesser extent than TC.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift.

Giambi was the American League MVP in 2000 while with the Athletics, and is a five-time All-Star who led the American League in walks four times, in on-base percentage three times, and in doubles and in slugging percentage once each, and won the Silver Slugger Award twice. Giambi has publicly apologized for using performance-enhancing drugs during his career.\\n\\nLate in 2003, Giambi was named by FBI officers investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) as being one of the baseball players believed to have received anabolic steroids from trainer Greg Anderson.  In December 2004, the San Francisco Chronicle reported it had seen Giambi's 2003 grand jury testimony in the BALCO investigation. The newspaper said that in his testimony, Giambi admitted to using several different steroids during the off-seasons from 2001 to 2003, and injecting himself with human growth hormone during the 2003 season. In a press conference prior to the 2005 season, Giambi apologized publicly to the media and his fans, though he did not specifically state what for. The lawyer who illegally leaked the testimony later pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison.  Giambi apologized again on May 16, 2007, this time specifically for using steroids, and urged others in the sport to do the same. \\"I was wrong for using that stuff\\", he told USA Today. \\"What we should have done a long time ago was stand up--players, ownership, everybody--and said, 'We made a mistake.'\\" When asked why he used steroids, Giambi responded: \\"Maybe one day I'll talk about it, but not now.\\" Giambi did speak with George J.

She is particularly noteworthy for attacking alcohol-serving establishments (most often taverns) with a hatchet. Nation also had concerns about tight clothing for women. In fact, she refused to wear a corset and urged women not to wear them because of their harmful effects on vital organs.\\n\\nNation was born in Garrard County, Kentucky, to George and Mary (nee Campbell) Moore. Her father was a successful farmer, stock trader, and slaveholder of Irish descent. During much of her early life, her health was poor and her family experienced financial setbacks. The family moved several times in Kentucky and finally settled in Belton, Missouri in 1854. She had poor education and informal learning.  In addition to their financial difficulties, many of her family members suffered from mental illness, her mother at times having delusions. There is speculation that the family did not stay in one place long because of rumors about Nation's mother's mental state. Some writers have speculated that Nation's mother, Mary, believed she was Queen Victoria because of her love of finery and social airs. Mary lived in an insane asylum in Nevada, Missouri, from August 1890 until her death on September 28, 1893. Mary was put in the asylum through legal action by her son, Charles, although there is suspicion that Charles instigated the lawsuit because he owed Mary money.  The family moved to Texas as Missouri became involved in the Civil War in 1862. George did not fare well in Texas, and he moved his family back to Missouri. The family returned to High Grove Farm in Cass County. When the Union Army ordered them to evacuate their farm, they moved to Kansas City. Carrie nursed wounded soldiers after a raid on Independence, Missouri. The family again returned to their farm when the Civil War ended.  In 1865 Carrie met a young physician who had fought for the Union by the name of Charles Gloyd, a severe alcoholic. Gloyd taught school near the Moores' farm while deciding where to set up his medical practice. He eventually settled on Holden, Missouri, and asked Nation to marry him. Nation's parents objected to the union because they believed he was addicted to alcohol. However, the marriage proceeded. They were married on November 21, 1867, and separated shortly before the birth of their daughter, Charlien, on September 27, 1868. Gloyd died less than a year later of alcoholism, in 1869.  No doubt influenced by the death of her husband, Carrie Nation developed a passionate activism towards alcohol. With the proceeds from selling the land her father had given her (as well as that of her husband's estate), she built a small house in Holden. She moved there with her mother-in-law and Charlien, and attended the Normal Institute in Warrensburg, Missouri, earning her teaching certificate in July 1872. She taught at a school in Holden for four years. She obtained a history degree and studied the influence of Greek philosophers on American politics.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Carrie Nation","rationale":"The given text is an account of the life and activities of Carrie Nation, a member of the temperance movement.

We propose a CNN for energy-aware dynamic routing, called the EnergyNet, that achieves adaptive-complexity inference based on the inputs, leading to an overall reduction of run time energy cost without noticeably losing (or even improving) accuracy. That is achieved by proposing an energy loss that captures both computational and data movement costs. We combine it with the accuracy-oriented loss, and learn a dynamic routing policy for skipping certain layers in the networks, that optimizes the hybrid loss.

He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was known as Richard Coeur de Lion or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior.\\nContext: In September 1190 Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily. After the death of King William II of Sicily his cousin Tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in 1190 as King Tancred I of Sicily, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance, wife of the new Emperor Henry VI. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister, and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip Augustus. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip and Tancred. Its main terms were:  Joan was to receive 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold as compensation for her inheritance, which Tancred kept.  Richard officially proclaimed his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, son of Geoffrey, as his heir, and Tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to Arthur when he came of age, giving a further 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold that would be returned by Richard if Arthur did not marry Tancred's daughter.  The two kings stayed on in Sicily for a while, but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men, with Philip Augustus plotting with Tancred against Richard. The two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys (who had supposedly been the mistress of Richard's father Henry II).\\nQuestion: What else did he promise\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"The two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys","rationale":"The answer is: The two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys.\\nAs we can see from the context, there was disagreement between King Phillip Augustus and Richard I over issues such as money that had been left by Joan (King William II’s wife), who was also Richard’s sister.

In this work, we demonstrate that language understanding via a reading policy learner is a promising vehicle for generalisation to new environments. We propose a grounded policy learning problem, Read to Fight Monsters (RTFM), in which the agent must jointly reason over a language goal, relevant dynamics described in a document, and environment observations. We procedurally generate environment dynamics and corresponding language descriptions of the dynamics, such that agents must read to understand new environment dynamics instead of memorising any particular information. In addition, we propose txt2π, a model that captures three-way interactions between the goal, document, and observations. On RTFM, txt2π generalises to new environments with dynamics not seen during training via reading. Furthermore, our model outperforms baselines such as FiLM and language-conditioned CNNs on RTFM. Through curriculum learning, txt2π produces policies that excel on complex RTFM tasks requiring several reasoning and coreference steps.","target":"We show language understanding via reading is promising way to learn policies that generalise to new environments","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe show language understanding via reading is promising way to learn policies that generalise to new environments."},{"source":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: \\n\\nArctic Tundra The Arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forest and is located throughout the Arctic regions of the northern hemisphere (Figure 44.12). The average winter temperature is -34 °C (-34 °F) and the average summer temperature is from 3 °C to 12 °C (37 °F–52 °F). Plants in the arctic tundra have a very short growing season of approximately 10–12 weeks. However, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. The annual precipitation of the Arctic tundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation. And, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation due to the cold temperatures. Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground (Figure 44.20). There is little species diversity, low net primary productivity, and low aboveground biomass. The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost. The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter.

His father, Olu Dara (born Charles Jones III), is a jazz and blues musician, from Mississippi. His mother, Fannie Ann (Little) Jones, was a Postal Service worker from North Carolina. He has one sibling, a brother named Jabari Fret who is best known as \\"Jungle\\", a member of the hip-hop group Bravehearts.\\n\\nAs a teenager, Nas enlisted his best friend and upstairs neighbor Willy \\"Ill Will\\" Graham as his DJ. Nas initially went by the nickname \\"Kid Wave\\" before adopting his more commonly known alias of \\"Nasty Nas\\". In the late-1980s, he met up with the producer Large Professor and went to the studio where Rakim and Kool G Rap were recording their albums. When they were not in the recording studio, Nas would go into the booth and record his own material. However, none of it was ever released. In 1991, Nas performed on Main Source's \\"Live at the Barbeque\\". In mid-1992, Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records during the same year. Nas made his solo debut under the name of \\"Nasty Nas\\" on the single \\"Halftime\\" from MC Serch's soundtrack for the film Zebrahead. Called the new Rakim, his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community.  In 1994, Nas's debut album, Illmatic, was finally released. It was awarded best album of 1994 by The Source. It also featured production from Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, LES and DJ Premier, as well as guest appearances from Nas's friend AZ and his father Olu Dara. The album spawned several singles, including \\"The World Is Yours\\", \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\", and \\"One Love\\". Shaheem Reid of MTV News called Illmatic \\"the first classic LP\\" of 1994. In 1994, Nas also recorded the song \\"One on One\\" for the soundtrack to the film Street Fighter. In his book To the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic, William Jelani Cobb writes of Nas's impact at the time:  Nas, the poetic sage of the Queensbridge projects, was hailed as the second coming of Rakim--as if the first had reached his expiration date. [...] Nas never became 'the next Rakim,' nor did he really have to. Illmatic stood on its own terms. The sublime lyricism of the CD, combined with the fact that it was delivered into the crucible of the boiling East-West conflict, quickly solidified [his] reputation as the premier writer of his time.  Steve Huey of AllMusic described Nas's lyrics on Illmatic as \\"highly literate\\" and his raps \\"superbly fluid regardless of the size of his vocabulary\\", adding that Nas is \\"able to evoke the bleak reality of ghetto life without losing hope or forgetting the good times\\". Reviewing Nas's second album It Was Written, Leo Stanley of allmusic believed the rhymes to be not as complex as those in Illmatic but still \\"not only flow, but manage to tell coherent stories as well\\". About.com ranked Illmatic as the greatest hip-hop album of all time, and Prefix magazine praised it as \\"the best hip-hop record ever made\\".\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Who else helped?","target":"\\".

If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube.

Under 100 words is a good title length.\\n\\nSharing of preprints-scientific manuscripts that are posted in a publicly accessible, online repository before peer review for journal publication-can accelerate access to information in infectious disease outbreaks, according to an article published earlier this month by Michael Johansson and colleagues in PLOS Medicine. In an analysis of published articles and those posted on preprint servers, the authors found that preprint posting increased during the 2015-17 outbreak of Zika in the Americas relative to the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and that preprints, while still used for only a small proportion of papers, provided much earlier access to scientific findings [1] . For medical journal editors who agreed in late 2015 and early 2016 that authors should not be penalized for sharing results in public health emergencies [2-4], these results signal gratifying progress over practices in 2003, when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was shown to have ended before 93% of journal articles on the epidemiology of SARS were published [5] . PLOS Medicine has long permitted the posting of preprints for research articles submitted to the journal, and this remains our policy. For the most part, posting of preprints has been occasional, undertaken on the initiative of authors without the journal's involvement. In the coming months, PLOS journals that handle research in more basic biological fields will begin facilitating preprint posts of journal submissions, with author approval, on the bioRxiv preprint server operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory [6] . PLOS Medicine will not initially be offering transfer of submitted manuscripts to bioRxiv as preprints. Because the journal's scope encompasses clinical and policy-related research, we believe it is important now to establish appropriate standards for the early sharing of research that has potential implications for human health but has not been peer reviewed. As preprint servers for clinically focused research become more widely available and preprint posting becomes more routine and more closely integrated with journal publishing, editors of medical journals should join the conversation about best practices for preprint sharing in medical research. In calling for wider use of preprints, Johansson and colleagues note the importance of protecting participant confidentiality, ensuring that posted research was ethically conducted, and guarding against misinterpretation of results that have yet to undergo peer review, either by traditional journal routes or through newer, more public venues [1] . In medical research, competing interests have been shown to be associated with reported outcomes [7] , and editors and peer reviewers persuade authors to tone down overstated conclusions prior to publication as a matter of course. At the same time, the press and other media networks are expected to disseminate the latest available information, and even readers with an urgent interest in a given health-related topic may be hard pressed to assess the validity of research methodology.

He is known for three acclaimed works of Latin literature, the \\"Eclogues\\" (or \\"Bucolics\\"), the \\"Georgics\\", and the epic \\"Aeneid\\". A number of minor poems, collected in the \\"Appendix Vergiliana\\", are sometimes attributed to him.\\n\\n- Publius Ovidius Naso (20 March 43 BC  AD 17/18), known as Ovid in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to \\"carmen et error\\", \\"a poem and a mistake\\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars.\\n\\n- Christian Falster ( January 1 , 1690 -- October 24 , 1752 ) was a Danish poet and philologist , born at Branderslev ( island of Laaland ) . He became rector of the school at Ribe . He preferred to live there , refusing to accept better positions , and keeping his rectorship . He published translations of Ovid ( 1719 ) and the Satires of Juvenal ( 1731 ) ; 11 original satires on his times , often reprinted ( 1720 -- 39 ) ; and in Latin a number of works , such as Viglia Prima Noctium Ripensiun ( 1721 ) ; Memoriœ Obscurœ ( 1722 ) ; Amœnitates Philologicœ ( three volumes , 1821 -- 32 ) . The editors of The Classical Journal wrote that : Falster thought that all learning should be brought to bear upon theology , and , like Erasmus , he though ( sic ) that classical authors could contribute much toward sound religion . Falster 's work covered a broad field from the history of Greek literature on the one hand , to Latin lexicography on the other , recognizing that philology , in the narrow sense , and literature are inextricably interwoven .\\n\\n- Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (c. 35  c. 100 AD) was a Roman rhetorician from Hispania, widely referred to in medieval schools of rhetoric and in Renaissance writing. In English translation, he is usually referred to as Quintilian, although the alternate spellings of Quintillian and Quinctilian are occasionally seen, the latter in older texts.\\n\\n- Quintus Horatius Flaccus (December 8, 65 BC  November 27, 8 BC), known in the English-speaking world as Horace (or ), was the leading Roman lyric poet during the time of Augustus (also known as Octavian).

The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet.\\n\\n- Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.\\n\\n- Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.\\n\\n- A classical language is a language with a literature that is \\"classical\\". According to UC Berkeley linguist George L.

There are a variety of doctoral degrees, with the most common being the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to the scientific disciplines. There are also some doctorates in the US, such as the Juris Doctor (JD), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and the Doctor of Medicine (MD), which are generally regarded internationally as professional degrees rather than doctorates, as they are not research degrees and no defense of any dissertation or thesis is performed. Many universities also award \\"honorary doctorates\\" to individuals who have been deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or for other contributions to the university or to society.\\n\\n- An Associate degree is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting two years . It is considered to be greater level of education than a high school diploma or GED but less than a Bachelor 's degree . The Foundation degree in the United Kingdom Diploma of Higher Education ( DipHE ) in Scotland and the Higher Certificate in the Republic of Ireland can be considered European equivalents of associate degrees . These programs are mainly provided through affiliated colleges at universities . In 2004 , Australia added \`\` associate degree '' to the Australian Qualifications Framework . This title was given to more academically focused advanced diploma courses . However , very few courses yet use the new title . In the Netherlands , there were four pilots between 2005 and 2011 to assess the added value of the associate degree . In 2011 the associate degree has been added to the Dutch system of higher education as a means to close the gap with the vocational education system .\\n\\n- An academic degree is a qualification awarded on successful completion of a course of study in higher education, normally at a college or university. These institutions commonly offer degrees at various levels, typically including bachelor's, masters and doctorates, often alongside other academic certificates, and professional degrees. The most common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree, although in some countries lower qualifications are titled degrees (e.g. associate degrees in the US or foundation degrees in the UK) while in others a higher-level first degree is more usual.\\n\\n- In Italy, the Iaurea is the main post-secondary academic degree.

In some institutions and educational systems, some bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed. In countries with qualifications frameworks, bachelor's degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework (sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor's degrees are considered separately), although some qualifications titled bachelor's degrees may be at other levels (e.g. MBBS) and some qualifications with non-bachelor's titles may be classified as bachelor's degrees (e.g. the Scottish MA and Canadian MD).\\n\\n- A professional degree, sometimes known as a first professional degree, is a degree that prepares someone to work in a particular profession, often meeting the academic requirements for licensure or accreditation.

At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:\\n\\nPlanet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun.

It is also called Terra or terra firma in Latin and Greek respectively. In fact, it is the only known planet to support life as we know it. The Earth has a unique place among all other planets because of its position relative to the sun that allows for liquid water.\\n\\nThe main reason why Neptune travels farther than earth each year around our star is due to its orbit being more elliptical (elongated) compared with Earth's nearly circular orbit; but like other planets closer toward center of solar system they have shorter orbital period and will travel smaller distance each full revolution around our parent star."},{"source":"Decide the language of that sentence.

The Patriots punted on their first drive of the game, giving the Jets the ball at their own 3-yard line. After a 1-yard Thomas Jones run, Jets quarterback Clemens threw an interception to Eugene Wilson, who returned it for a touchdown. Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line. With 6:36 remaining in the first quarter, the Patriots began a drive that ended 17 plays later, in the 2nd quarter, on a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. After a Jets punt, the Patriots moved the ball to their own 40-yard line when a Chris Hanson punt attempt was blocked by David Bowens and returned for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead to 10-7. On the Jets' next possession, Washington blocked a Graham punt attempt to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 3-yard line. A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season.

With an altitude variance of over 7,000 ft (2,100 m), the park has a number of different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately 10,000 ft (3,000 m), tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line to the base of the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park.

From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December.\\nWar's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53.

Passage:He served as Managing Editor/contributor and Art Director for Dark Discoveries magazine for over four years. His novella, Milton’s Children, was published by Bad Moon Books in early 2013. In addition to award wins and nominations, Brock's work has generally been well-received, and his poetry, short stories, nonfiction articles, introductions and essays have been widely published internationally online, as well as in dozens of horror, science fiction and fantasy books and scholarly print magazines (Fangoria, Dark Discoveries, Calliope, Comic-Con International's Souvenir Book, the Weird Fiction Review [print edition], American Rationalist [an organ of the Center for Inquiry], etc.), and multiple anthologies working with a wide array of publishers and editors (Butcher Knives and Body Counts, S. T. Joshi's Black Wings series, Matt Cardin's Teeming Brain website and his book Horror Literature Through History, Animal Magnetism, and so on). A content expert in multiple areas, he has been a frequent special guest and panelist at many horror and science fiction conventions (such as Necronomicon-Providence, MythosCon, Norwescon, Crypticon, World Horror Convention, World Fantasy Convention, and others) and film festivals (including the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival, Buffalo International Film Festival, Lovecraft's Visions, etc.). He has also been a guest lecturer and speaker at various colleges and universities (including at the invitation of James E. Gunn to the University of Kansas Center for the Study of Science Fiction). In 2015, at the invitation of author Greg Bear, Brock and Nolan contributed writings, along with others, as examples from significant Washington State authors to the Washington Centennial Time Capsule. A sealing ceremony was held in the state capital of Olympia, Washington. In late 2015, he was featured as the Editor Guest of Honor at the largest science fiction convention in Oregon, OryCon 37.","target":"b","rationale":"The question is asking about the company that published \\"Brock's novella Milton’s Children\\".

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- Euphausia is the largest genus of krill, and is placed in the family Euphausiidae. There are 31 species known in this genus, including Antarctic krill (\\"Euphausia superba\\") and ice krill (\\"Euphausia crystallorophias\\") from the Southern Ocean, and North Pacific krill (\\"Euphausia pacifica\\") in the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n- Krill are small crustaceans of the order Euphausiacea, and are found in all the world's oceans. The name \\"krill\\" comes from the Norwegian word \\"\\", meaning \\"small fry of fish\\", which is also often attributed to species of fish.\\n\\n- A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'euphausiidae'.","target":"nematoscelis","rationale":"The rationale is that: \\"nematoscelis\\" has the relation 'parent taxon' with euphausiidae."},{"source":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.\\nQuestion: What do you keep in a billfold?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. identification\\n\\nB. cell phone\\n\\nC. hip pocket\\n\\nD. money\\n\\nE. man's back pocket","target":"D","rationale":"A billfold is a small case used to carry paper currency.

The group is perhaps best known for hit singles such as \\"Round and Round\\" and \\"Lay It Down\\", tracks that ranked on Billboard's top 40 at No. 12 and No. 40, respectively, as well as other songs such as \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"You're in Love\\" and \\"Dance\\".\\nContext: The origins of Ratt go as far back as 1973 in Hollywood, with a band called Firedome, founded by singer Stephen Pearcy with a few friends. In 1974 the band broke up, with Pearcy forming Crystal Pystal. The name Crystal Pystal was later changed to Buster Cherry, which turned into Mickey Ratt in 1976.  Guitarist Robbin Crosby in those same years had been a member of the bands Metropolis with Tommy Asakawa and Parramore McCarty, Xcalibur, Phenomenon, Secret Service and Mac Meda with Askawa.  Mickey Ratt went through various line-up changes. Members included guitarists Jake E. Lee, Chris Hager, Paul DeNisco, and Bob DeLellis, bassists Matt Thorr, Tim Garcia, Mike New and Dave Jellison, and drummers John Turner, and Bob Eisenberg. The various Mickey Ratt line-ups released several demos compilations and a live concert recording.  In 1980, to increase their chances of landing a recording contract with a major label, the band recorded a single called \\"Dr. Rock\\" / \\"Drivin' on E\\", which was given to fans at their early Los Angeles club shows.  In 1981, the band's name was shortened to Ratt. Crosby played with the band later in the year. Guitarist Warren DeMartini, recommended by Lee, joined the band in January 1982. Bassist Gene Hunter (from Jake E. Lee's Teaser) and drummer Khurt Maier (who played drums on the early \\"Tell the World\\" recording featured on the compilation Metal Massacre I) temporarily played in Ratt before the arrival of Bobby Blotzer (ex-Vic Vergeat) and Juan Croucier (previously with Dokken, and musically active since 1973). DeMartini was only 18 years old when he was called up to Los Angeles to join Ratt. At the time he was attending college in San Diego and was reluctant to drop out to join a band that had, so far, had only limited success. Marq Torien briefly replaced DeMartini, though he returned in time for the recording of their first EP, later in 1982.\\nQuestion: what was the longer name before it was shortened?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Mickey Ratt","rationale":"The context states that the origins of Ratt go as far back as 1973 in Hollywood, with a band called Firedome.

Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. \\n\\n- Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.\\n\\n- The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.\\n\\n- The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chuichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it \\"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\\"\\n\\n- Frank Jack Fletcher (April 29, 1885  April 25, 1973) was an admiral in the United States Navy during World War II. Fletcher was the operational commander at the pivotal Battles of Coral Sea and of Midway. As a lieutenant, Fletcher was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in battle at Veracruz. He was the nephew of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, who was also awarded the Medal of Honor for actions at Veracruz.\\n\\n- A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.\\n\\n- World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- Yamamoto held several important posts in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and undertook many of its changes and reorganizations, especially its development of naval aviation. He was the commander-in-chief during the decisive early years of the Pacific War and so was responsible for major battles such as Pearl Harbor and Midway. He died when American codebreakers identified his flight plans and his plane was shot down. His death was a major blow to Japanese military morale during World War II.\\n\\n- Sir John Desmond Patrick Keegan (15 May 1934  2 August 2012) was a British military historian, lecturer, writer and journalist. He was the author of many published works on the nature of combat between the 14th and 21st centuries concerning land, air, maritime, and intelligence warfare, as well as the psychology of battle.\\n\\n- The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyjitai: Shinjitai: \\"\\" or \\"Nippon Kaigun\\", \\"Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire\\") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and the Ministry of the Navy, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN.\\n\\n- The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.\\n\\n- Pearl Harbor is a lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941 was the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II.\\n\\n- John Charles Waldron ( August 24 , 1900 -- June 4 , 1942 ) was a United States Navy aviator who led a squadron of torpedo bombers in World War II. He and most of his squadron perished in the Battle of Midway .\\n\\n- The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought during 48 May 1942, was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other, as well as the first in which neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other.\\n\\n- During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.\\n\\n- The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .\\n\\n- The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.\\n\\n- A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\".\\n\\n- Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.\\n\\n- Midway Atoll (also called Midway Island and Midway Islands; Hawaiian: \\"Pihemanu Kauihelani\\") is a atoll in the North Pacific Ocean at . As its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia. Midway Atoll is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Midway continues to be the only island in the Hawaiian archipelago that is not part of the state of Hawaii. Unlike the other Hawaiian islands, Midway observes Samoa Time (i.e., eleven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time), which is one hour behind the time in the state of Hawaii. For statistical purposes, Midway is grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing of land and water (mostly water) in the surrounding area, is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument.\\n\\n- The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and Operation Z during planning, was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941.

It marked the first time that the Colts got shut out in the first half since October 2006. In the third quarter, Minnesota increased its lead with Longwell nailing a 46-yard and a 28-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Indianapolis started to rally as RB Joseph Addai got a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Colts drew closer as QB Peyton Manning completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, followed by a 2-point conversion run by RB Dominic Rhodes.  Afterwards, near the end of game, Indianapolis completed its comeback as kicker Adam Vinatieri nailing the game-winning 47-yard field goal.\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: Which player scored the shortest touchdown of the game?","target":"Joseph Addai","rationale":"To answer the question \\"Which player scored the shortest touchdown of the game?\\", we need to identify which players and their respective touchdowns.

Finally, there was no other information about any other TDs in this article (the only field goal by Vinatieri was 47 yards).

Miami opened the game with an impressive 80-yard drive after the opening kickoff, which lead to a quarterback Ryan Tannehill two-yard rushing touchdown. Two possessions later at the (3:28) mark in the first quarter, Oakland quarterback Carson Palmer threw a 64-yard touchdown to Mike Goodson tying the game. Through a majority of the second quarter both teams had a hard time moving across the 50-yard line, which was matched with impressive punting by both Dolphins punter Brandon Fields and Oakland punter Shane Lechler.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing:\\nSome minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle.

This is when we know that the amount of sugar stays the same: 200 grams, but the volume has changed to some smaller value V (because some water has been evaporated). The percentage can be calculated as a formula: Concentration (%) = Mass (g) / Volume (L) * 100%. So if mass stays constant, then concentration increases if volume decreases.\\\\nIf concentration is doubled from 4% to 8%, then volume should be halved from 50 liters to 25 liters; If concentration is tripled from 4% to 12%, then volume should be divided by 3 times from 50 liters down to 16 2/3 liters; If concentration is quadrupled form 4% up to 16%, then volume goes down by a factor of 2 x 2 = 4 times; etc...\\\\nSo if we want our new solution with 10% concentration and 200 grams of sugar, which would mean 20 g per liter and would require V*20=200 --> V=10litres.

In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.","target":"Patagonian mara","rationale":"The rationale of this answer is that:\\nMother rodents provide both direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, retrieving and huddling, and indirect parenting, such as food caching, nest building and protection to their offspring.

Although it's usually more common in big cities, it can be found in almost any community, big or small.\\nThe problem with graffiti art is the question of whether it's really art. This isn't always an easy question to answer, simply because there are so many different types of graffiti. While some simply consists of collections of letters, known as tags, with little artistic value, such examples are easy to find, especially on larger spaces such as walls.\\nIf it weren't for the fact that most graffiti is placed on private property without permission, it might be more commonly recognized as a legal form of art. Most graffiti, however, annoys the property owner, who is more likely to paint over it or remove it than accept it as art.\\nMany ways of removing graffiti have been developed, such as paints that dissolve graffiti paint, or make it easy to remove. Community groups and government departments often organize graffiti-removal teams.\\nIt hardly makes sense to encourage artists to deface   private or public property; but perhaps there are ways to work with them rather than just oppose them. Graffiti artists can, for example, create murals   for property owners, and get paid for them.\\nMaybe we need to start at a very basic level, and find a way to encourage the creation of graffiti art on paper or canvas rather than on walls.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).\\n\\nGeologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes.

From China comes the belief that the year of birth influences one's personality. In the past century, a new belief ahs arisen: the idea that personality is related to one's ABO blood type. People with blood type A, for example, are considered more likely to be serious, hard-working, and quiet, while people with blood type O are likely to be popular and outgoing, yet often unable to finish what they start. Though this belief continues to be strong, some people question whether it is true.\\nThe blood-type personality theory  started in Japan in 1927 when Furukawa Takehi noticed personality similarities and differences among his workers. This idea soon went out of fashion, but was brought back by a Japanese television host named Toshitaka Nomi in the 1970s. The belief is still strong in Japan and is increasingly popular in neighboring countries. _ A recent study showed 76 percent of Koreans aged between13 and 64 believing in the blood-type personality connection. Though most Asians might believe in the blood-type theory, for many it seems harmless and not something to be taken too seriously.\\nIs the belief true?

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \\n\\nQuestion: What assertion did President Obama make about the country's infrastructure?\\nI found this answer \\"It'll create jobs and improve the economy\\".

Therefore, this sentence is an incorrect representation of an adjunct island and should be denoted as \\"bad\\".\\\\nAn adjunct island is a syntactic structure in which the movement of a phrase is limited by the presence of another phrase. Because some clauses are considered to be islands (i.e., they cannot have their contents moved around), they can prevent movement from taking place past them.[1] The most common type of adjunct islands involve wh-movement, which occurs when a wh-phrase (\\"what\\", \\"how\\", \\"where\\", etc.) moves from its base position to another position within the same clause. For example, if we want to ask about the location where Sarah was confused, we can form: \\"(Where) did Sarah confuse?\\" In this case, the wh-word \\"where\\" has moved from its base position at the beginning of a question (\\"Sarah confused where?\\") to become part of the interrogative clause in order to determine what it refers to (i.e., where she was confused). However, if there are certain types of subordinate clauses between our interrogative clause and our wh-word's original position that block this movement (such as relative clauses or adverbial clauses), it will not be possible for us to move our wh-word across these blocks; instead we must put our question outside these blocks in order for movement across them not to occur: *(Where) did Sarah confuse [the answer you gave me yesterday]?

Suboptimal beliefs about the chronicity of asthma may perpetuate poor asthma control among inner-city asthmatics. This study sought to characterize beliefs about the chronicity of disease and its correlates in a cohort of inner-city adults with persistent asthma.', 'Prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study.', 'One hundred ninety-eight adults hospitalized with asthma over a 12-month period at an inner-city teaching hospital.', 'Sociodemographics, clinical history, disease beliefs, and self-management behaviors were collected by interview. Information on self-reported use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), peak flowmeters, and regular asthma visits was collected during hospitalization, and 1 month and 6 months after discharge.', 'This cohort was predominantly low income and nonwhite, with high rates of prior intubation, oral steroid use, and emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Overall, 53% of patients believed they only had asthma when they were having symptoms, what we call the no symptoms, no asthma belief. Men patients, those > or = 65 years old, and those with no usual place of care had greater odds of having the no symptoms, no asthma belief, and those receiving oral steroids all or most of the time or with symptoms most days had half the odds of having this belief (p < 0.05 for all). The no symptoms, no asthma belief was negatively associated with beliefs about always having asthma, having lung inflammation, or the importance of using ICS, and was positively associated with expecting to be cured. The acute disease belief was associated with one-third lower odds of adherence to ICS when asymptomatic at all three time periods (p < 0.02 for all).\\nAnswer: The single question, \\"Do you think you have asthma all of the time, or only when you are having symptoms?\\" can efficiently identify patients who do not think about or manage their asthma as a chronic disease.","target":"Is no symptoms , no asthma : the acute episodic disease belief associated with poor self-management among inner-city adults with persistent asthma?","rationale":"The given answer says, \\"The single question, \\"Do you think you have asthma all of the time, or only when you are having symptoms?\\" can efficiently identify patients who do not think about or manage their asthma as a chronic disease.\\" Therefore, the question should be: Is no symptoms , no asthma : the acute episodic disease belief associated with poor self-management among inner-city adults with persistent asthma?

So instead of spending their whole school day learning, Mathilda and her classmates start their day by spending two hours to the closest river fetching water ---water that is anyway most likely not safe to drink. They do the same thing again in the afternoon, so they often lose around half of their school day fetching water.\\nMathilda has to do the same thing outside of school hours to get the water her family needs at home, leaving her little time for studying. Because of rising temperatures, water has become harder and harder to find here, and people have to spend more and more time trying to find it.\\nThis is just one small example of how climate change is making it harder to realize people's rights to water, education and security. Unfortunately, most higher-income countries remained silent on the issue.\\nThis is despite studies showing that communities already facing marginalization ,such as women and children, mostly suffer from climate change. This is especially the case for those in countries with limited resources and fragile ecosystems.\\nMeanwhile, women consist of the majority of the world 's poor,and so are more dependent for their livelihood on natural resources that are threatened by climate change.

Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.\\n\\n- Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties. The region is traditionally described as eight counties, based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, which includes Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions. Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States.\\n\\n- Ennis is a city in Ellis County, Texas, United States, located south of Dallas. The population was 18,513 at the 2010 census, up from 16,454 at the 2000 census. The city is notable for its historic Czech heritage, with several community halls dedicated to different fraternities and organizations celebrating Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak heritage. It is also home to the Bluebonnet Festival, the National Polka Festival, and several National Hot Rod Association drag races at the Texas Motorplex, most notably the AAA Texas NHRA FallNationals.\\n\\n- The Texas State Capitol, completed in 1888 in Downtown Austin, contains the offices and chambers of the Texas Legislature and the Office of the Governor. Designed in 1881 by architect Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed from 1882 to 1888 under the direction of civil engineer Reuben Lindsay Walker. A $75 million underground extension was completed in 1993. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1986. The Texas State Capitol is tall, making it the sixth tallest state capitol and one of several taller than the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.\\n\\n- A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.\\n\\n- San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States. It is in San Diego County, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California, approximately south of Los Angeles and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico.\\n\\n- Dallas is a major city in the state of Texas and is the largest urban center of the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the United States. The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,300,092 as of July 1, 2015.\\n\\n- Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.\\n\\n- Dr. Dale Vance Holliday ( May 29 , 1940 -- February 4 , 2010 ) was born in Ennis , Texas and attended the University of Texas at Austin . He graduated with a B.S. and M.A. in Physics and did extensive theoretical and experimental research on the Mössbauer effect . He died in San Diego on February 4 , 2010 after a period of illness . Holliday became one of the first 100 employees of Tracor in 1962 and quickly became Director of Analysis and Applied Research in the Electronic Systems Division . In 1965 Holliday left Austin to develop the Tracor facility in San Diego and began his doctorate in applied physics at the University of California , San Diego . In San Diego Holliday began his study in acoustics for which he is known . His study of transient flow in natural gas pipelines led to the publication of a textbook which is still used as a standard reference . In the 1970s Holliday began testing a revolutionary technique for the detection and size measurement of zooplankton in thin layers involving multi-frequency backscattering . The technique developed and after twenty years became the established framework for research in the field . In the early 1980s Holliday built the first prototype of the Tracor Acoustical Profiling System ( TAPS ) which has been described as decades ahead of its time by the Acoustical Society of America . TAPS is now the standard instrument for acoustical profiling of plankton in the sea . Holliday published hundreds of papers on underwater acoustics and acoustical oceanography and given dozens of talks and symposia in several countries . In 2004 Holliday became only the third recipient of the Acoustical Society of America Silver Medal in Acoustical Oceanography , for \`\` contributions to the study of marine life , from plankton to whales '' . Holliday was awarded the Prix d'Excellence by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ( ICES ) in recognition of extraordinary contributions , fulfilling the ICES vision of scientific discovery , leadership , and applications that...\\n\\n- In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest).\\n\\n- The Mössbauer effect, or recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence, is a physical phenomenon discovered by Rudolf Mössbauer in 1958.

Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ).

Woo island was frequently shaken by earthquakes, but Mud island had no such problems.\\n\\nHint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break.

A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a $250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award.

Soon afterward, Jericho repeatedly called out WCW World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg in an attempt to begin a feud with him, but never actually wrestled him. Jericho cites Eric Bischoff, Goldberg and Hulk Hogan's refusal to book Jericho in a pay-per-view squash match loss against Goldberg, which Jericho felt would be a big draw, as a major reason for leaving the company.  On November 30, Jericho lost the World Television Championship to Konnan. In early 1999, Jericho began a feud with Perry Saturn. The feud saw Jericho and Saturn instigating bizarre stipulation matches, such as at Souled Out, where Jericho defeated Saturn in a \\"loser must wear a dress\\" match. At SuperBrawl IX, Jericho and Saturn wrestled in a \\"dress\\" match which Jericho won. Saturn finally defeated Jericho at Uncensored in a Dog Collar match. Jericho alternated between WCW and a number of Japanese tours before he signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on June 30. Jericho's final WCW match came during a Peoria, Illinois house show July 21, where he and Eddie Guerrero lost to Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio Jr. in a tag team match.

In a tent out in the vast cornfields, a boy preacher (Robert Gerdisch), claims that an Old Testament-era Canaanite God whom he calls \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" has spoken to him in his dreams. He tells the other children that the sinful adults are the reason for the drought, prompting them to kill everybody over the age of nineteen in town. They then establish a death cult with the prime rule that, upon reaching the age of nineteen, one must be sacrificed to the cult's God.\\nIn April 1975, twelve years later, a bickering couple, Vietnam veteran Burt (David Anders) and his wife Vicky (Kandyse McClure), are driving along a back road near Gatlin, planning on celebrating their second honeymoon in California, when a boy named Joseph (Remington Jennings) stumbles out of the roadside corn and in front of their car. After accidentally running Joseph over, Burt assesses the body and realizes the boy's throat was slashed. After wrapping and placing the body in the trunk, Burt tells Vicky to wait for him while he looks around with shotgun in hand. Among the corn, Burt finds Joseph's bloodied suitcase and takes it with him back to the car. He and Vicky drive off in search of aid, not realizing they are being watched by Isaac (Preston Bailey), the 9-year old current cult leader, and his most loyal follower, 18-year-old warrior Malachai (Daniel Newman).\\nAfter hearing a group of children giving an evangelical sermon over the radio, Burt and Vicky reach an abandoned gas station.

Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.\\n\\nParagraph: Two politicians are proposing ideas they have about how to better serve the planet. Greg remarks that for too long the ozone layer has been a hindrance to progress and that scientists need to work to eliminate it.

I watched him basically blame everything under the sun on my coworker (who eventually became a friend) until he found a new job and quit. The thing that finally threw me over the edge was when he started scamming me out of hours. I work the same amount of hours every single week and as time progresses, he’ll pay me for less and less hours. I know it’s not an accident, he knows exactly what he’s doing. It’s the SAME hours, SAME amount, every two weeks. Last pay check it was just 1 hour unaccounted for, this time around it’s 3. That’s 4 hours of work that I didn’t get paid for. 4 hours that I could’ve spent studying, doing homework, etc. On the day when we were supposed to get our checks, he said he didn’t have him and that they’d be in the next day. I didn’t work the next day so I asked him if he could text me and I could swing by and come get it. His response was “why? You don’t need it.” I’m living with my mom, typically have very few expenses (I pay for gas, and other things here and there) and am pretty well off to be completely honest. However, that’s money I worked for and I need to get my oil changed, filters replaced etc. I shouldn’t even have to justify it. It’s MY money. I want to vent to my dad but I’m afraid he’ll tell my stepmom and it will come around and bite me in the ass somehow. I’m just so fed up and I’m not really sure what to do.

Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.\\n\\nUsing the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which team observed boiling in the can?","target":"team B","rationale":"The question asks which team observed boiling in the can.

After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Brian, his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine.\\n\\nRecording sessions for the band's first album took place in Capitol's basement studios in the famous tower building in August 1962, but early on Brian lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Brian's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Brian fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production - though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.  In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's United Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use double tracking on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. The Surfin' U.S.A. album was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.  Brian was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the Surfer Girl album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Brian decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, Little Deuce Coupe, which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the Surfer Girl LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Brian was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.  For much of the decade, Brian attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists. On July 20, 1963, \\"Surf City\\", which he co-wrote with Jan Berry of Jan and Dean, was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Brian, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean. Brian's other non-Beach Boy work in this period included tracks by the Castells, Donna Loren, Sharon Marie, the Timers, and the Survivors. The most notable group to which Wilson would attach himself in this era would be the Honeys, which Wilson intended as the female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and as an attempt to compete with Phil Spector-led girl groups such as the Crystals and the Ronettes. He continued juggling between recording with the Beach Boys and producing records for other artists, but with less success at the latter--except for Jan and Dean.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Brian Wilson","rationale":"The context is entirely focused on Brian Wilson's music career.

Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station before the war, his mission was to protect Allied merchant shipping by hunting down German commerce raiders. Late in 1914 he was tasked to search for and destroy the East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy as it headed home around the tip of South America.

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants.

Thyroid radioactivity measurements were done daily in 6 euthyroid and 6 hyperthyroid patients (thyroid weight 204 +/- 69 g; 1.9 +/- 0.9 GBq 131I). An iodine biokinetic model and the MIRD methodology were used to estimate absorbed doses in organs. Cancer risks were calculated using ICRP Publication 60.   \\n RESULTS Cumulated absorbed doses on the skin (TLD measurements) were 4.2 +/- 1.4 Gy (thyroid), 1.2 +/- 0.6 Gy (submandibular) and 0.4 +/- 0.2 Gy (parotid). All these values were significantly correlated with the amount of radioiodine retained in the thyroid at 24 hr (euthyroid versus hyperthyroid not significant). Absorbed doses in the thyroid of 94 +/- 25 Gy for euthyroid and 93 +/- 17 Gy for hyperthyroid patients were calculated (thyroid radioactivity measurements). Extrathyroidal absorbed doses (means of 12 patients) were 0.88 Gy in the urinary bladder, 0.57 Gy in the small intestine, 0.38 Gy in the stomach, and ranged from 0.05 to 0.30 Gy in other organs (euthyroid versus hyperthyroid not significant). A 1.6% life-time risk of development of cancer outside the thyroid gland was calculated. When applied to people of 65 yr and older the estimated risk is approximately 0.5%.   \\n CONCLUSION These data may help in choosing the treatment regimen for individual patients with a large, multinodular goiter, who have to be treated for hyperthyroidism or compressive problems. In younger patients, surgery may be preferred. However, for elderly patients and patients with cardiopulmonary disease, the advantages of noninvasive radioiodine treatment will outweight the life-time risk of this mode of therapy.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the objective of the study (\\"UNLABELLED In patients with a large, multinodular goiter (> 100 g), radiation absorbed doses in the thyroid, surrounding tissues and remainder of the body were estimated after therapeutic administration of 131I(3.7 MBq or 100 microCi/g of thyroid tissue retained at 24 hr).\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of this study.

The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than $34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another $215 million in gold and $2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda.

It included men who were World War II Navy and Marine veterans, and were hospitalized during their military service with a diagnosis of either a nonpenetrating head injury or another unrelated condition. In 1996 to 1997, military medical records were abstracted to document the occurrence and details of closed head injury. The entire sample was then evaluated for dementia and AD using a multistage procedure. There were 548 veterans with head injury and 1228 without head injury who completed all assigned stages of the study. The authors estimated risk of dementia, specifically AD, using proportional hazards models.   \\n RESULTS Both moderate head injury (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.32; CI = 1.04 to 5.17) and severe head injury (HR = 4.51; CI = 1.77 to 11.47) were associated with increased risk of AD. Results were similar for dementia in general. The results for mild head injury were inconclusive. When the authors stratified by the number of APOE epsilon4 alleles, they observed a nonsignificant trend toward a stronger association between AD and head injury in men with more epsilon4 alleles.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Moderate and severe head injuries in young men may be associated with increased risk of AD and other dementias in late life.

The total mass of the erupted material (including magma) was 35 million tonnes—only 3% of the amount that erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980.  The eruption reached a value of 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000 tonnes, or about 2% of the mass of the erupted solid material, making the eruption atypically sulfur-rich.The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks. It also destroyed a small lake that was observed in Arenas crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty and contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice; this effect was confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.\\nThe lahars, formed of water, ice, pumice, and other rocks, mixed with clay as they travelled down the volcano's flanks. They ran down the volcano's sides at an average speed of 60 km per hour, eroding soil, dislodging rock, and destroying vegetation. After descending thousands of meters down the side of the volcano, the lahars were directed into all of the six river valleys leading from the volcano. While in the river valleys, the lahars grew to almost 4 times their original volume. In the Gualí River, a lahar reached a maximum width of 50 meters (200 ft).One of the lahars virtually erased the town of Armero in Tolima, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Only one quarter of its 28,700 inhabitants survived. The second lahar, which descended through the valley of Chinchiná River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of Chinchiná, in the department of Caldas.

In 1625, a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet of 52 ships and 12,000 men rapidly recaptured Salvador. In 1630 the Dutch returned, and captured Olinda and then Recife, renamed Mauritsstadt, thus establishing the colony of New Holland. The Portuguese commander Matias de Albuquerque retreated his forces inland, to establish a camp dubbed Arraial do Bom Jesus. Until 1635, the Dutch were unable to harvest sugar due to Portuguese guerrilla attacks, and were virtually confined to the walled perimeter of the cities. Eventually, the Dutch evicted the Portuguese with the assistance of a local landlord named Domingos Fernandes Calabar, but on his retreat to Bahia, Matias de Albuquerque captured Calabar at Porto Calvo, and had him hang for treason.

The material damage caused by the war to property came to over £30 million. Particularly damaging to the Free State's economy was the systematic destruction of railway infrastructure and roads by the Republicans. In addition, the cost to the Free State of waging the war came to another £17 million. By September 1923, Deputy Hogan estimated the cost at £50 million. The new State ended 1923 with a budget deficit of over £4 million. This weakened financial situation meant that the new state could not pay its share of Imperial debt under the treaty. This adversely affected the boundary negotiations in 1924-25, in which the Free State government acquiesced that border with Northern Ireland would remain unchanged in exchange for forgiveness of the Imperial debt.

When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\".\\nIsberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo.

After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist.

These nine points are:\\n\\n- Karl Wilhelm von Feuerbach ( 30 May 1800 -- 12 March 1834 ) was a German geometer and the son of legal scholar Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach , and the brother of philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach . After receiving his doctorate at age 22 , he became a professor of mathematics at the Gymnasium at Erlangen . In 1822 he wrote a small book on mathematics noted mainly for a theorem on the nine - point circle , which is now known as Feuerbach 's theorem . In 1827 he introduced homogeneous coordinates , independently of Möbius .\\n\\n- Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the \\"Elements\\". Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The \\"Elements\\" begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the \\"Elements\\" states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.\\n\\n- Projective geometry is a topic of mathematics. It is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations. This means that, compared to elementary geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are that projective space has \\"more\\" points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called \\"points at infinity\\") to Euclidean points, and vice versa.\\n\\n- In mathematics, homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates, introduced by August Ferdinand Möbius in his 1827 work \\"Der barycentrische Calcül\\", are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry. They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates. Formulas involving homogeneous coordinates are often simpler and more symmetric than their Cartesian counterparts. Homogeneous coordinates have a range of applications, including computer graphics and 3D computer vision, where they allow affine transformations and, in general, projective transformations to be easily represented by a matrix.\\n\\n- A circle is a simple closed shape in Euclidean geometry. It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius.\\n\\n- Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.\\n\\n- Geometry (from the ; \\"geo-\\" \\"earth\\", \\"-metron\\" \\"measurement\\") is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.\\n\\n- In geometry, an affine transformation, affine map or an affinity (from the Latin, \\"affinis\\", \\"connected with\\") is a function between affine spaces which preserves points, straight lines and planes. Also, sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation. An affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points, though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.\\n\\n- A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices \\"A\\", \\"B\\", and \\"C\\" is denoted formula_1.\\n\\n- August Ferdinand Möbius (17 November 1790  26 September 1868) was a German mathematician and theoretical astronomer.\\n\\n- The Regnitz is a river in Bavaria, Germany. It is a left tributary of the Main and is in length.\\n\\n- In geometry, a set of points are said to be concyclic (or cocyclic) if they lie on a common circle. All concyclic points are the same distance from the center of the circle. Three points in the plane that do not all fall on a straight line are concyclic, but four or more such points in the plane are not necessarily concyclic.\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'field of work' with the subject 'karl wilhelm feuerbach'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- class\\n - computer graphics\\n - computer vision\\n - engineering\\n - english\\n - geometry\\n - language\\n - law\\n - map\\n - mathematician\\n - mathematics\\n - nature\\n - number theory\\n - river\\n - software","target":"geometry","rationale":"Karl Wilhelm von Feuerbach is a German mathematician who was famous for his study of geometry."},{"source":"Generate a question that has the following answer: \\nWatch television together. \\nfor the following movie plot: \\nWhen a young girl, Amanda McCready, goes missing in Boston, the case attracts widespread media attention.

This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers.\\nThe Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired.

In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down.

According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331.

Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.\\nAt a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.\\nThe incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use.

Whereas today it is surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula was surrounded by a fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.Neanderthals are known to have lived in caves around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was excavated at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.More Neanderthal remains have been found elsewhere on the Rock at Devil's Tower and in Ibex, Vanguard and Gorham's Caves on the east side of Gibraltar. Excavations in Gorham's Cave have found evidence of Neanderthal occupation dated as recently as 28,000–24,000 years ago, well after they were believed to have died out elsewhere in Europe. The caves of Gibraltar continued to be used by Homo sapiens after the final extinction of the Neanderthals. Stone tools, ancient hearths and animal bones dating from around 40,000 years ago to about 5,000 years ago have been found in deposits left in Gorham's Cave.

Such keywords can be directly from the given abstract or outside it.\\n\\nAbstract: Management of foreign body airway obstruction continues to be a major controversy in emergency medical care. Much of the disagreement is without doubt based on lack of a uniformly accepted model of acute airway obstruction representative of the clinical event. A variety of models have been used to assess different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies. These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction. It seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected.","target":"Airway Obstruction","rationale":"The abstract talks about different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies, as well as the factors that contribute to airway obstruction and the recommended treatment for such cases.
