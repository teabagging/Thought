In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056 Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard Compact Disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in Brussels. Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979.

In five patients undergoing surgical vascular procedures, specimens containing atheromatous plaques were removed and immediately incubated in autologous oxygenated blood at 37 degrees C with hematoporphyrin derivative at a clinically relevant concentration for 2 hours. On exposure to ultraviolet light, porphyrin fluorescence was noted throughout each plaque, whereas adjacent plaque-free tissue showed no fluorescence. To compare in vitro with in vivo hematoporphyrin derivative uptake by plaques, the fluorescence of three types of arterial lesions (induced by a high cholesterol diet, catheters or balloon injury) was studied in 16 New Zealand White rabbits. Each lesion fluoresced selectively with the same intensity whether hematoporphyrin derivative exposure was performed in vitro or in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy did not show a difference in the pattern of hematoporphyrin derivative fluorescence between in vitro and in vivo specimens. The results suggest that human atheromatous plaques should take up hematoporphyrin derivative in vivo and are, therefore, potentially suitable for photochemical treatment as a new therapeutic approach to atherosclerosis.","target":"Uptake of hematoporphyrin derivative by atheromatous plaques: studies in human in vitro and rabbit in vivo","rationale":"In this paper, the authors have studied the uptake of hematoporphyrin derivative by atheromatous plaques in humans and rabbits.

He occupied Peshawar without any opposition. He first crossed the Indus River in 1748, the year after his ascension - his forces sacked and absorbed Lahore. The following year , the Mughal ruler was induced to cede Sindh and all of the Punjab including the vital trans Indus River to him, in order to save his capital from being attacked by the forces of the Durrani Empire. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Durrani and his forces turned westward to take possession of Herat, which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, Shah Rukh. The city fell to the Afghans in 1750, after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict; the Afghan forces then pushed on into present-day Iran, capturing Nishapur and Mashhad in 1751. Durrani then pardoned Shah Rukh and reconstituted Khorasan, but a tributary of the Durrani Empire.

There was a dark side to success.\\nFairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits.\\nThe majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career.\\nThe studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed.\\nThe danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources.\\nProfessional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level.\\nPsychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.”\\nWhat do studies about stress find?\\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\\n- That a moderate level of stress can benefit living things\\n- That even a small level of stress is always harmful\\n- not enough information\\n- That stress is never harmful","target":"That a moderate level of stress can benefit living things","rationale":"The passage discusses studies about stress, its potential benefits and harmful effects.

Mauboy has three older sisters Sandra, Jenny and Catherine, and a younger sister Sophia.\\n\\nIn January 2010, Mauboy signed to Universal Music for an exclusive worldwide long-term publishing agreement. In May 2010, Mauboy collaborated with four other international artists representing their continents--Sean Kingston representing America, Jody Williams representing Africa, Tabitha Nauser (Asia), Steve Appleton (Europe), with Mauboy representing Oceania--on the theme song for the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics titled \\"Everyone\\". Mauboy, Williams, Nauser and Appleton performed \\"Everyone\\" at the opening of the Youth Olympics held in Singapore on 14 August 2010. Kingston was unable to attend the performance, due to a passport mix-up. Mauboy released her second studio album Get 'Em Girls on 5 November 2010; it debuted at number six and was certified gold. She had travelled to the United States in February of that year to work on the album in Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta with American songwriters and producers, most of whom she had not worked with previously. Mauboy co-wrote eight of the album's songs. Get 'Em Girls received mixed reviews from critics. Majhid Heath of ABC Online Indigenous gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars, writing that it's a \\"non-cohesive mess of similar sounding, auto-tuned ravaged pop/R&B that diminishes the talent of this brilliant young songstress\\".  The album's title track, featuring American rapper Snoop Dogg, peaked at number 19. Mauboy performed \\"Get 'Em Girls\\" at the 2010 Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards, where she co-hosted the award ceremony with Liam Hemsworth and Jerry Trainor, and won the award for Fave Aussie Muso. The following singles, \\"Saturday Night\\" featuring American rapper Ludacris and \\"What Happened to Us\\" featuring English singer Jay Sean, peaked at numbers seven and 14, respectively. The former single was certified double platinum while the latter was only certified platinum. At the 2010 Australian of the Year Awards, Mauboy received her first nomination for Young Australian of the Year. On 10 December 2010, she performed in front of an audience of 92,000 at the Federation Square in Melbourne, ahead of Oprah Winfrey's visit to the place. Mauboy's performance was shown in the first of the four Australian specials of The Oprah Winfrey Show on 18 January 2011. In April 2011, she served as a support act for Chris Brown's Australian leg of his F.A.M.E. Tour.  Get 'Em Girls was re-released as a deluxe edition on 12 August 2011, which included the singles \\"Inescapable\\" and \\"Galaxy\\" featuring Stan Walker. The former single peaked at number four and was certified double platinum, while the latter peaked at number 13 and was certified platinum. \\"Galaxy\\" also reached number 36 on the New Zealand Singles Chart and became Mauboy's first single to chart in that country. On 17 November 2011, Mauboy performed for the Australian troops at RAAF Base Darwin, ahead of US President Barack Obama's visit to the place. In January 2012, Mauboy and Walker embarked on their Galaxy Tour across Australia, which served as her first headlining tour.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910.

It was part of the 3rd Guards Tank Army during the war, and was converted into a tank division like the rest of the tank corps in 1945.

For much of the 1980s it formed part of the 3rd Red Banner Army. As the Cold War wound down, the troops of the GSFG, renamed the Western Group of Forces in 1989, were pulled out of Germany, and the 7th Guards Tank Division was withdrawn to Pyriatyn in Ukraine, where it became a storage base in July 1990.","target":"b","rationale":"The question asks for the countries that battled in the Battle of Kursk, which is not mentioned directly in the passage.

The primary port for the operation was Quanzhou in Fujian, then the center of China's maritime trade. They landed on Komodahama beach on Tsushima Island on October 5, 1274. Sō Sukekuni, governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement. The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded Iki. Tairano Takakage, the Governor of Iki, fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen, but he killed himself after his unit was defeated. The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in Hakata Bay, a short distance from Dazaifu, the ancient administrative capital of Kyūshū. The following day brought the Battle of Bun'ei , also known as the \\"First Battle of Hakata Bay\\". The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007 and was the Senate's third-ranking Republican from 2001 to 2007. He ran as a candidate for the 2012 Republican Party presidential nomination, finishing second to Mitt Romney. Santorum was elected as a United States Senator from Pennsylvania in 1994.\\nContext: Santorum served in the United States Senate representing Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2007. From 2001 until 2007, he was the Senate's third-ranking Republican. He was first elected to the Senate during the 1994 Republican takeover, narrowly defeating incumbent Democrat Harris Wofford, 49% to 47%. The theme of Santorum's 1994 campaign signs was \\"Join the Fight!\\" During the race, he was considered an underdog, as his opponent was 32 years his senior. He was reelected in 2000, defeating U.S. Congressman Ron Klink by a 52-46% margin. In his reelection bid of 2006, he lost to Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. by a 59-41% margin.  After his election to the Senate in 1994, Santorum sought to \\"practice what [he] preached\\" and hired five people for his staff who were on welfare, food stamps, or other government aid.  In 1996, Santorum served as Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force on Welfare Reform, and contributed to legislation that became the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. Santorum was an author and the floor manager of the bill. In 1996, Santorum endorsed moderate Republican Arlen Specter in his short-lived campaign for president. Reporters have observed that though Santorum and Specter differed on social policy, Specter provided him with key political staff for his successful run in 1994.  The National Taxpayers Union, a fiscal conservative organization, gave Santorum an \\"A-\\" score for his votes on fiscal issues, meaning that he was one of \\"the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies\\" during his tenure, and ranked fifth in the group's rankings out of 50 senators who served at the same time.\\nQuestion: What else did you find interesting?. Whats the answer?","target":"Santorum served as Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force","rationale":"The context states that Santorum served as Chairman of the Republican Party Task Force on Welfare Reform.

In 2016, he was knighted for his musical achievements and his services to tourism and charitable causes in Northern Ireland. Known as \\"Van the Man\\", Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \\"Gloria\\".\\n\\nBert Berns, Them's producer and composer of their 1965 hit, \\"Here Comes the Night\\", persuaded Morrison to return to New York to record solo for his new label, Bang Records. Morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied. Then, during a two-day recording session at A & R Studios starting 28 March 1967, eight songs were recorded, originally intended to be used as four singles. Instead, these songs were released as the album Blowin' Your Mind! without Morrison being consulted. He said he only became aware of the album's release when a friend mentioned on a phone call that he had just bought a copy of it. He later commented to Donal Corvin in a 1973 interview: \\"I wasn't really happy with it. He picked the bands and tunes. I had a different concept of it.\\"  However, from these early sessions emerged \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\". Captured on the 22nd take on the first day, this song was released as a single in mid-June 1967, reaching number ten in the US charts in 1967. \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" became Morrison's most played song and over the years it has remained a classic; forty years later in 2007, it was the fourth most requested song of DJs in the US.  Following the death of Berns in 1967, Morrison became involved in a contract dispute with Berns' widow, Ilene Berns, that prevented him from performing on stage or recording in the New York area. The song \\"Big Time Operators\\", released in 1993, is thought to allude to his dealings with the New York music business during this time period. He then moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and was soon confronted with personal and financial problems; he had \\"slipped into a malaise\\" and had trouble finding concert bookings. However, through the few gigs he could find, he regained his professional footing and started recording with Warner Bros. Records. The record company managed to buy out his contract with Bang Records. Morrison fulfilled a clause that bound him to submit thirty-six original songs within a year to Web IV Music, Berns' music publishing company, by recording thirty-one songs in one session; however, Ilene Berns thought the songs \\"nonsense music ... about ringworms\\" and did not use them. The throwaway compositions came to be known as the \\"revenge\\" songs. They were officially released on the compilation set The Authorized Bang Collection in 2017.\\n\\nwhen diid she join bang record","target":"Then, during a two-day recording session at A & R Studios starting 28 March 1967,","rationale":"The correct answer is \\"Then, during a two-day recording session at A & R Studios starting 28 March 1967,\\".\\nShe joined Bang record in the year she recorded eight songs for them on a two day recording sessions which started from the date of 28th march 1967.\\n\\n \\n</code>\\nI am new to NLP and no idea how to approach this problem .

We have demonstrated in this study that, in both resting and activated states, mouse peripheral CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) expressed remarkably higher surface levels of TNFR2 than CD4(+)CD25(-) T effector cells (Teffs). In cocultures of Tregs and Teffs, inhibition of proliferation of Teffs by Tregs was initially transiently abrogated by exposure to TNF, but longer exposure to TNF restored suppressive effects. Cytokine production by Teffs remained continually suppressed by Tregs. The profound anergy of Tregs in response to TCR stimulation was overcome by TNF, which expanded the Treg population. Furthermore, in synergy with IL-2, TNF expanded Tregs even more markedly up-regulated expression of CD25 and FoxP3 and phosphorylation of STAT5, and enhanced the suppressive activity of Tregs. Unlike TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 did not up-regulate FoxP3-expressing Tregs. Furthermore, the number of Tregs increased in wild-type mice, but not in TNFR2(-/-) mice following sublethal cecal ligation and puncture. Depletion of Tregs significantly decreased mortality following cecal ligation and puncture. Thus, the stimulatory effect of TNF on Tregs resembles the reported costimulatory effects of TNF on Teffs, but is even more pronounced because of the higher expression of TNFR2 by Tregs. Moreover, our study suggests that the slower response of Tregs than Teffs to TNF results in delayed immunosuppressive feedback effects.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract describes the results of a study that investigated the effects of TNF (tumor necrosis factor) on CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells and CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells.

We have coffee with MIL whom starts naming off all the people who are going to MI to my 6 year old, only my 2 boys are left off. Thinking it's an error I say nothing. 2 days later at dinner attended by entire family and my 20 year old (other son was not there thank fucking goodness) &amp; MIL starts the same shit of all who are invited in a sing-song voice to the grandkids. My boys are left off again in front of my 20 yr old.\\n\\nCome to find out entire family has been planning this trip without my 2 sons. WTF?

Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S.

One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country.

With an altitude variance of over 7,000 ft (2,100 m), the park has a number of different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately 10,000 ft (3,000 m), tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line to the base of the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island.

Instead, it is a summer course.\\nThe course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations and driving time to practise driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students have a text from which they study the basic laws they must know to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone wanting to get a driver's license.\\nDriving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel (steering wheel) and practise starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two-hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and \\"driver\\" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back.\\nDrivers Ed cars are unlike other cars in which they have two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and one on the other side where the instructor sits. Thus, if the student driver should run into difficulties the instructor can take over. The car also has another special feature. On the top of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should use extra caution because the student driver is a beginning driver, not very experienced and prone to driving slowly.\\nAfter the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old), they can go to a designated state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test.

John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero . Rai stated, \\"All I can tell you is it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before.\\" Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice.

A notable film shot and set in Melbourne during Australia's cinematic lull is On the Beach (1959). The 1970s saw the rise of the Australian New Wave and its Ozploitation offshoot, instigated by Melbourne-based productions Stork and Alvin Purple.

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime.

All patients were without documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) before the investigation. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced in two patients on day 5, but in nine on day 24 after infarction. This difference in incidence was statistically significant (p less than 0.05), as was the change in the distribution ratio of induced sustained ventricular arrhythmia from day 5 to day 24 (p less than 0.05). The types of arrhythmia induced on day 24 were sustained ventricular tachycardia with a mean cycle length of 207 ms in six cases (five monomorphic, one polymorphic), and ventricular fibrillation in three cases. These nine patients did not differ from the remaining nine patients in maximal serum creatine kinase, infarct site, number of stenosed coronary arteries, global left ventricular ejection fraction (47 +/- 7% versus 46 +/- 10%) and results of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring, but they had a significantly shorter right ventricular effective refractory period (223 +/- 10 ms versus 259 +/- 28 ms; p less than 0.05).

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones.\\nI had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium.\\nThe counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints.\\nThere was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “\\nI suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness.

To address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against a well-defined class of adversaries. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest robustness against a first-order adversary as a natural security guarantee. We believe that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models.","target":"We provide a principled, optimization-based re-look at the notion of adversarial examples, and develop methods that produce models that are adversarially robust against a wide range of adversaries","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe provide a principled, optimization-based re-look at the notion of adversarial examples, and develop methods that produce models that are adversarially robust against a wide range of adversaries."},{"source":"Congress' appropriation for LSC takes it from a budget of $329.\\n\\nDoes it follow that \\"The budget of LSC.\\"?\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"yes","rationale":"This is a logical reasoning task.

A pathogen is an organism or virus that causes disease in another living thing. Pathogens are commonly called germs. Watch this dramatic video for an historic perspective on infectious diseases and their causes: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: There are several types of pathogens that cause diseases in human beings. They include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The different types are described in Table 21.1. The table also lists several diseases caused by each type of pathogen. Many infectious diseases caused by these pathogens can be cured with medicines. For example, antibiotic drugs can cure most diseases caused by bacteria. Different pathogens spread in different ways. Some are easy to catch. Others are much less contagious. Some pathogens spread through food or water. When harmful bacteria contaminate food, they cause foodborne illness, commonly called food poisoning. An example of a pathogen that spreads through water is the protozoan named Giardia lamblia, described in Table 21.1. It causes a disease called giardiasis. Some pathogens spread through sexual contact. In the U.S., the pathogen most commonly spread this way is HPV, or human papillomavirus. It may cause genital warts and certain types of cancer. A vaccine can prevent the spread of this pathogen. Many pathogens spread by droplets in the air. Droplets are released when a person coughs or sneezes, as you can see in Figure 21.2. The droplets may be loaded with pathogens. Other people may get sick if they breathe in the pathogens on the droplets. Viruses that cause colds and flu can spread this way. Other pathogens spread when they are deposited on objects or surfaces. The fungus that causes athletes food spreads this way. For example, you might pick up the fungus from the floor of a public shower. You can also pick up viruses for colds and flu from doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces. Still other pathogens are spread by vectors. A vector is an organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another. Most vectors are insects such as ticks or mosquitoes. They pick up pathogens when they bite an infected animal and then transmit the pathogens to the next animal they bite. Ticks spread the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Mosquitoes spread the protozoa that cause malaria. What can you do to avoid infectious diseases? Eating well and getting plenty of sleep are a good start. These habits will help keep your immune system healthy. With a healthy immune system, you will be able to fight off many pathogens. Vaccines are available for some infectious diseases. For example, there are vaccines to prevent measles, mumps, whooping cough, and chicken pox. These vaccines are recommended for infants and young children. You can also take the following steps to avoid picking up pathogens or spreading them to others. Watch this video for additional information on preventing the spread of infectious diseases: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Wash your hands often with soap and water. Spend at least 20 seconds scrubbing with soap. See Figure 21.3 for effective hand washing tips. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. This includes kissing, hugging, shaking hands, and sharing cups or eating utensils. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or shirt sleeve, not your hands. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as keyboards and doorknobs, especially if someone is sick. Stay home when you are sick. The best way to prevent diseases spread by vectors is to avoid contact with the vectors. For example, you can wear long sleeves and long pants to avoid tick and mosquito bites. Using insect repellent can also reduce your risk of insect bites. \\n Question: __any organism or virus that causes disease in another living thing","target":"pathogen","rationale":"The correct answer is 'pathogen'."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a question and an answer, you would be asked to create the sentence based on the Question-Answer provided.

He was raised in Jersey City's Second ward, an area known as The Horseshoe due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop. The ward was created when the Republican-controlled legislature gerrymandered a district within Jersey City in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes. By age 14, Hague was expelled from school prior to completing the sixth grade for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior.\\n\\nHague's use of voter fraud is the stuff of legend. In 1937, for instance, Jersey City had 160,050 registered voters, but only 147,000 people who were at least 21 years old--the legal voting age.  In 1932, Governor Moore appointed a lawyer named Thomas J. Brogan, who had served as Hague's personal attorney in corruption hearings, to an associate Justice seat on the state's Supreme Court. Less than a year later Brogan was named as Chief Justice. In at least two instances of alleged voting fraud in the 1930s (Ferguson v. Brogan, 112 N.J.L. 471; Clee v. Moore, 119 N.J.L. 215; In re Clee, 119 N.J.L. 310), Brogan's court issued extraordinary rulings in favor of the Democratic machine, in one case asserting that the district superintendent of elections had no authority to open ballot boxes, and in another case ruling that the boxes could be opened, but no one had the right to look inside. Brogan also assigned himself to the Hudson County jurisdiction, thereby controlling the local grand jury process and squelching other election fraud cases.  Although Hague, like other political bosses of the time, was not above outright fraud at the polls, the keys to Hague's success were his matchless organizational skills and demand for complete loyalty from his subordinates. His command over the Democratic voters of Hudson County, a densely populated urban area in a state that was still mostly rural, made him a man to reckon with among state Democrats and Republicans alike. He was a close friend of Al Smith, the New York governor who would become the first Irish-American presidential candidate in 1928. In addition, Hague's support of Roosevelt for President was rewarded with a steady stream of perks that sustained Hague's organization throughout the Depression.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Frank Hague","rationale":"The given paragraph is about Frank Hague, a politician from the United States.

Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands.\\n\\nand a hint : Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999).

It first appeared in 1796 , in London in 4 volumes , and related the tale of Amanda and Oscar Fitzalan , two young people in love who are robbed of their rightful inheritance by a forged will . Her third novel , was a major commercial success , remaining in print for most of the 19th century , although its critical reception suffered from its original publication by the sensationalist Minerva Press . The Children of the Abbey was also mentioned in Jane Austen 's popular novel Emma and in Emily Climbs by L. M. Montgomery .\\n\\n- Regina Maria Roche (17641845) is considered today to be a minor Gothic novelist who wrote in the shadow of Ann Radcliffe. She was, however, a best seller in her own time. The popularity of her third novel, \\"The Children of the Abbey\\", rivaled that of Ann Radcliffes \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\".\\n\\n- Minerva Press was a publishing house, noted for creating a lucrative market in sentimental and Gothic fiction in the late 18th century and early 19th century. It was established by William Lane (1745?-1814) at No 33 Leadenhall Street, London, when he moved his circulating library there in about 1790.\\n\\n- The Mysteries of Udolpho, by Ann Radcliffe, was published in four volumes on 8 May 1794 by G. G. and J. Robinson of London. The firm paid her £500 for the manuscript. The contract is housed at the University of Virginia Library. Her fourth and most popular novel, \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" follows the fortunes of Emily St. Aubert, who suffers, among other misadventures, the death of her father, supernatural terrors in a gloomy castle and the machinations of an Italian brigand. Often cited as the archetypal Gothic novel, \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho,\\" along with Radcliffe's novel \\"The Romance of the Forest\\", plays a prominent role in Jane Austen's novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\", in which an impressionable young woman, after reading Radcliffe's novel, comes to see her friends and acquaintances as Gothic villains and victims with amusing results.\\n\\n- Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\".\\n\\n- Ann Radcliffe (née Ward, 9 July 1764  7 February 1823) was an English author and pioneer of the Gothic novel. Her style is Romantic in its vivid descriptions of landscapes and long travel scenes, yet the Gothic element is obvious through her use of the supernatural. It was her technique, \\"the explained supernatural\\" as the final revelation of inexplicable phenomena, which helped the Gothic novel achieve respectability in the 1790s.\\n\\n\\n\\n'the children of the abbey' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- gothic fiction\\n - gothic novel\\n - horror\\n - literature\\n - love\\n - manuscript\\n - novel\\n - romantic\\n - supernatural\\n - terror\\n - travel","target":"gothic novel","rationale":"The Children of the Abbey is a novel by Gothic novelist Regina Maria Roche.

The Long War against Habsburg Austria (1593–1606) created the need for greater numbers of Ottoman infantry equipped with firearms, resulting in a relaxation of recruitment policy. This contributed to problems of indiscipline and outright rebelliousness within the corps, which were never fully solved. Irregular sharpshooters (Sekban) were also recruited, and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the Jelali revolts (1595–1610), which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With the Empire's population reaching 30 million people by 1600, the shortage of land placed further pressure on the government . In spite of these problems, the Ottoman state remained strong, and its army did not collapse or suffer crushing defeats. The only exceptions were campaigns against the Safavid dynasty of Persia, where many of the Ottoman eastern provinces were lost, some permanently. This 1603–1618 war eventually resulted in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha, which ceded the entire Caucasus, except westernmost Georgia, back into Iranian Safavid possession. Campaigns during this era became increasingly inconclusive, even against weaker states with much smaller forces, such as Poland or Austria.\\nWhat is the paragraph about?","target":"Ottoman Empire","rationale":"The paragraph describes the Ottoman Empire during a time period between 1593 and 1606.

Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive.

She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.\\nAs a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.

We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, “well Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.” This fellow student knew I didn’t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week’s assignment. He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief.

(She bought them for my brother and when i came along, i wore them too.) Sister-in-law wanted nothing to do with them for neice. Most are pretty gender neutral, so when my mom was babysitting and neice needed clothes changed, she would put on some of said clothes (a pair of jeans for example) so she could enjoy the outfit for a while, but SIL would come to pick her up and change her out of clothes before heading home, leaving childhood clothes at my moms house.

When their frustrated director drops them in the middle of a jungle, they are forced to rely on their acting skills to survive the real action and danger. The screenplay by Justin Theroux, Stiller, and Etan Cohen was from a story by Stiller and Theroux. The film was produced by Stuart Cornfeld, Stiller and Eric McLeod for Red Hour Productions and DreamWorks Pictures as an international co-production between the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\\n\\nAlthough Southern California and Mexico were considered for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected for the majority of the shooting. Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, and helicopters. After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.  Tropic Thunder was the first major studio production on Kaua'i in five years. After filming was completed, it was deemed the largest production filmed on the island to date, and contributed more than $60 million to the local economy. Tim Ryan, the executive editor of Hawaii Film & Video Magazine, commented on the filming on the island: \\"I think Tropic Thunder will give Kaua'i much needed and long idled publicity in the production arena ... It should put Kaua'i back on the production consideration radar.\\" Preliminary production crews were on the island starting in December 2006 and principal photography began in July 2007, with filming lasting thirteen weeks over seven separate locations on the island. Much of the filming took place on private land as well as conservation status designated areas. Casting calls on the island sought 500 residents to portray the villagers in the film. Two units shot simultaneously on the island from the ground, and an aerial unit shot from helicopters. Many of the sets and the bridge used for one of the final scenes were built in three months. The island's erratic weather hampered filming with rain and lighting issues. The crew also faced complications in moving the equipment and cast due to the difficult terrain.  The film advising company Warriors Inc. was enlisted to ensure the war scenes, including the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic. Former members of the U.S. military taught the actors how to handle, fire, and reload their weapons, as well as perform various tactical movements. The opening war scene was filmed over three weeks and required fifty stuntmen. Animatics were used to map out the necessary camera angles for filming.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what was the name of the island?","target":"Kaua'i","rationale":"The context states that the film was shot in Hawaii, but does not specify which Hawaiian island. However it is mentioned later on that Kaua'i holds a special place for director Ben Stiller as he owns a house there and spent time exploring before deciding to shoot there.

Because state laws exist, polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level, but the practice is considered \`\`against public policy'' and, accordingly, the U.S. government won't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other), even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated.

Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing.\\n\\n- A ski is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow. Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski.\\n\\n- International Ski Federation (FIS; short for Fédération Internationale de Ski) is the world's highest governing body for international winter sports. Founded in 1924, it is responsible for the Olympic disciplines of Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, Nordic combined, freestyle skiing and snowboarding. The FIS is also responsible for setting the international competition rules. The organization now has a membership of 118 national ski associations and is based in Oberhofen am Thunersee, Switzerland.\\n\\n- The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means.\\n\\n- The 1928 Winter Olympics, officially known as the II Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"IIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\") (German: \\"Olympische Winterspiele 1928\\") (Italian: \\"II Giochi olimpici invernali\\") (Romansch: \\"Gieus olimpics d'enviern 1928\\"), were a winter multi-sport event which was celebrated February 1119, 1928 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The 1928 Games were the first true \\"Winter Olympics\\" held on its own as they were not in conjunction with a \\"Summer Olympics\\". The preceding 1924 Games were retroactively renamed the inaugural Winter Olympics, though they had been in fact part of the 1924 Summer Olympics. All preceding Winter Events of the Olympic Games were the winter sports part of the schedule of the Summer Games, and not held as a separate Winter Games. These games also replaced the now redundant Nordic Games, that were held quadrennially since early in the century.\\n\\n- Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing.\\n\\n- St. Moritz (also , , ) is a high Alpine luxury resort in the Engadine in Switzerland, at an elevation of about above sea level. It is Upper Engadine's major village and a municipality in the district of Maloja in the Swiss canton of Graubünden.\\n\\n- Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.\\n\\n- A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states.

He competed in the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix and the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz . Anders Haugen was the first - and as of 2016 , only - American to win an Olympic medal for ski jumping . Anders Olsen Haugen was born in Bø in Telemark , Norway . Anders Haugen and his brother Lars emigrated to the United States in 1909 and built a ski jumping hill with the Milwaukee Ski Club near Lake Nagawicka west of Milwaukee , Wisconsin , in order to open ski jumping to the public of the area . In 1911 Anders Haugen set a world record of 46m ( 152 feet ) on Curry Hill in Ironwood , Michigan while winning the National Championship . Between 1910 and 1920 , the Haugen brothers won the U.S. National Championships eleven times . In 1919 and 1920 , Anders Haugen set the World record ski jumping distances of 213 ft ( 64.92m ) and 214 ft ( 65.23m ) , respectively . He was Captain of the first US skiing team at the 1924 Winter Olympics . Haugen and his brothers later moved to northwestern Wisconsin and then Frisco , Colorado . Haugen had won the 1924 Olympic ski jumping bronze medal in the individual large hill , though he was not awarded the medal due to a scoring error . In 1974 , at the 50th reunion of the 1924 Norwegian team , Norwegian sports historian Jacob Vaage was going over the results when he noticed an error . The bronze medal had been awarded to Norwegian skier Thorleif Haug , who also won three gold medals in the first Winter Olympics in Chamonix . On 12 September 1974 , Anders Haugen came to Norway as an 86 - year - old and was given the bronze medal by Anna Maria Magnussen , Thorleif Haug 's youngest daughter . In 1929 , Haugen and his brother Lars moved to the Lake Tahoe area in California , where he developed the Lake Tahoe Ski Club . Up until his 70s , he directed the junior skiing program at the ski club . Haugen was elected to the Colorado Ski and Snowboard Hall of...\\n\\n- Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games).\\n\\n- The 1924 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris, France. It was the second time Paris hosted the games, after 1900. The selection process for the 1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids, and Paris was selected ahead of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Prague, and Rome. The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921.\\n\\n- A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate.\\n\\n- Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).\\n\\n- The Nordic Games was the first international multi-sport event that focused primarily on winter sports, and was held at varying intervals between 1901 and 1926. It was organized by Swedens Central Association for the Promotion of Sports, and more specifically by Viktor Balck, a member of that association and one of the five original members of the International Olympic Committee. It was, in many ways, a precursor to the modern Winter Olympic Games, whose success was a contributing factor (along with the social and economic turmoil following World War I) to the Nordic Games's discontinuation in the 1920s.\\n\\n- Holmenkollbakken is a large ski jumping hill located at Holmenkollen in Oslo, Norway. It has a hill size of HS134, a construction point of K-120, and a capacity for 70,000 spectators. Holmenkollen has hosted the Holmenkollen Ski Festival since 1892, which since 1980 have been part of the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and 1983 the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup. It has also hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1930, 1966, 1982 and 2011.\\n\\n- The Winter Olympic Games is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practised on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994.\\n\\n- The 1924 Winter Olympics, officially known as the I Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"Iers Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), were a winter multi-sport event which was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Originally called \\"Semaine Internationale des Sports d'Hiver\\" (\\"International Winter Sports Week\\") and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, the sports competitions were held at the foot of Mont Blanc in Chamonix, and Haute-Savoie, France between January 25 and February 5, 1924. The Games were organized by the French Olympic Committee, and were in retrospect designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the I Olympic Winter Games.\\n\\n- The Engadin or Engadine (, , ; lit.: \\"Valley of the Inn people\\") is a long high Alpine valley region in the eastern Swiss Alps located in the canton of Graubünden in most southeastern Switzerland with about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the Inn from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, one hundred kilometers downstream. The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Donau, as the only Swiss river. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'anders haugen' and 'nordic combined'?","target":"sport","rationale":"The rationale to choose \\"sport\\" as the answer is that:\\n\\nHere's the rationale: Anders Haugen competed in Nordic Combined at 1924 & 1928 Winter Olympics."},{"source":"You are given a mathematical question described with an open-ended vocabulary.

Passage:Through his involvement with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, general manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at Westminster Underground station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel.

The repainting gave the city a unique style, turning it into a tourist attraction. Rama was awarded World Best Mayor in 2004. The award committee, motivated their decision stating that \\"Edi Rama is the man who changed a whole city. Now there is a new Tirana, colored, happy, with a new and improved infrastructure and cultural life\\".  As mayor he compiled the Tirana City Master Plan  including the Skanderbeg Square project. He planted thousands of new trees, making Tirana a much more environment-friendly city. Rama also expanded the existing roads and paved new ones, improving mobility. According to a UNDP report  Rama played a critical role in the modernization of the local government, empowering municipalities and giving them, for the first time real power to impact the life of their communities.  Rama was reelected as Mayor of Tirana by defeating Democratic Party of Albania candidates Spartak Ngjela, a former attorney, in 2003 and Sokol Olldashi in 2007.  In 2011, Rama decided to run for a fourth term in office. His opponent, Lulzim Basha was a member of Prime Minister Berisha's cabinet. Rama's reelection bid failed after a court ruling decided hundreds of ballots mistakenly cast in the wrong ballot boxes were valid. The initial count saw Rama ahead by 10 votes. With all ballots counted Lulzim Basha won the race by 81 votes. Edi Rama appealed the court's decision at the Electoral College and demanded the reinstatement of the initial tally. Rama's appeals were rejected and Lulzim Basha was sworn in as the new Mayor of Tirana. Rama and the Socialist Party criticized the judges involved in the court ruling, severely eroding public's trust in Albanian institutions.\\n\\nDid he win reelection?","target":"Rama was reelected as Mayor of Tirana by defeating Democratic Party of Albania candidates","rationale":"The context explains Edi Rama's political career and summarizes his success as Mayor of Tirana.

On offense, the Bears' worst-ranked rushing game (64 yards per game) had a chance to produce against the Packers, who were ranked 30th by allowing 156 yards per game, while opponents had run a league-most 37.3 times per game while scoring an also league-high five rushing touchdowns. Also, Matt Forte had recorded 336 yards and four touchdowns against the Packers in his last two games. The offense also was challenged by the pass defense, with defenders Sam Shields and Tramon Williams, who were stingy in man coverage. For the Bears' defense, the Packers had also struggled on the run, ranking 26th in the league with a 78-yard rushing average and the longest run being of 17 yards, while having averaged only 3.63 yards per carry. Additionally, Green Bay was ranked 28th in the league in yards. However, the team faced the Packers' passing attack, which featured the receiving duo of Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb. The former led the league in targets (37) and first downs (16), while ranking second in receiving yards (351), while the Bears had struggled with covering slant and dig routes, both of which Nelson excelled at. The latter had three touchdowns in 2014, but was used primarily for hitch and stick routes. The Packers were two-point favorites. Sherrick McManis, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Matt Slauson, Jared Allen, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery, and Ryan Mundy served as team captains for the game, while the honorary captains were Dick Butkus and Kurt Becker. The Packers won the coin toss, and decided to kick. On the first drive, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's six-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers responded with Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run. During Chicago's next drive, on 4th and 1, Cutler fumbled the snap, and upon picking up the ball, recorded a 16-yard run on an accidental fumblerooski. The drive continued into the second quarter, ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged touchdowns on the final three plays: Aaron Rodgers' three-yard pass to Nelson, Cutler's eight-yard pass to Jeffery, and Rodgers' 22-yard pass to Cobb. The Bears reached the Packers' nine-yard line by the final play of the first half; on the play, Cutler's pass for Bennett was ruled short of a touchdown. During the television review, Micah Hyde covered the camera angle, preventing the touchdown and ending the half with the Packers leading 21-17. In the third quarter, the Packers drove to the Bears' 34-yard line, where Rodgers completed a touchdown pass to Davante Adams, which would be nullified by a holding penalty on center Corey Linsley; Crosby would eventually kick a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler's pass for Josh Morgan would be tipped by Williams and intercepted by Clay Matthews, with Green Bay capitalizing on the takeaway with Rodgers' 11-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On the next drive, Shields intercepted Cutler, and Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal; however, a holding penalty on Jon Bostic led to Rodgers' three-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. On Chicago's next drive, Williams intercepted Cutler, but the play would be nullified; the Bears would subsequently punt. On the Packers' next drive, they would reach the Bears' 20-yard line before Crosby's field goal was blocked by Willie Young, the first block by the Bears in over a year. Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler on the final drive, and the Bears ran out the clock to end the game. The Bears recorded 496 yards, the first time since 1979 against the Minnesota Vikings that the Bears recorded such yardage and lost. The last time the team recorded more than 496 yards and lost occurred in 1947 against the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Cardinals. Additionally, the rushing attack recorded 102 yards in the first quarter, the first time Chicago recorded at least 100 rushing yards in the first quarter since 2010 against the Carolina Panthers.

The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men.

In 1794, President George Washington appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, and Adams would serve in high-ranking diplomatic posts until 1801, when Thomas Jefferson took office as president. Federalist leaders in Massachusetts arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over foreign policy and was denied re-election. In 1809, Adams was appointed as the U.S. ambassador to Russia by President James Madison, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the War of 1812. In 1817, newly-elected President James Monroe selected Adams as his Secretary of State. In that role, Adams negotiated the Adams–Onís Treaty, which provided for the American acquisition of Florida.

Thus, less than one percent of fresh water is present in lakes and rivers.

Humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water availability, such as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water from the ocean.

Much of this belief was based on the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius, a sixth-century mystic whose book, The Celestial Hierarchy, was popular among monks in France. Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.

Since the Abbot Suger was responsible for these renovations at Saint Denis cathedral specifically, he must have been the one who wanted to make his church brighter than others in order to promote Christianity.

A liberal arts college aims to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum. Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts. Although it draws on European antecedents, the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education, and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the American model.\\n\\n- Donald Thomas \\"Tom\\" Scholz (born March 10, 1947) is an American rock musician, inventor, engineer, and philanthropist, best known as the founder of the band Boston.

Here, we show that the potassium channel Kir2.1, mutations in which are associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome, is selected as cargo into Golgi export carriers in an unusual signal-dependent manner. Unlike conventional trafficking signals, which are typically comprised of short linear peptide sequences, Golgi exit of Kir2.1 is dictated by residues that are embedded within the confluence of two separate domains. This signal patch forms a recognition site for interaction with the AP1 adaptor complex, thereby marking Kir2.1 for incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi.

The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium).

During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.","target":"Greece","rationale":"The question is asking about acid precipitation falling in forests. The hint says that this damage caused by the very low pH of the rain, which brings us to soil and plants. Soil can also have a high or low pH (the higher the number on the scale from 1-14, lower ACIDITY - vinegar; lemon juice has strong acidic properties). In fact, certain soils need specific conditions to be able to grow different types of crops.

Some of these genes showed sexually dimorphic expression profiles during gonadal development, whereas others were expressed at similar levels in both sexes. The gene encoding Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) was expressed in both sexes prior to and during sexual differentiation of the gonads, with levels of expression consistently higher in males than in females. SOX9 expression was male-specific, and was up-regulated after the detection of AMH transcripts. SOX3 expression was observed prior to clear SOX9 expression and was up-regulated in both sexes at the onset of gonadal sex differentiation (but declined later in development). The WT1 gene was highly expressed in both sexes, whereas SF1 expression was clearly higher in developing ovaries compared to testes.

Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy.

However, the detailed mechanism underlying hepatocyte infection with HCV is not yet completely understood. We previously identified a novel C-type lectin-LSECtin predominantly expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that LSECtin can interact with two HCV receptors, DC-SIGNR and CD81, through its central ectodomain. Furthermore, cells expressing LSECtin specifically can be attached by the naturally occurring HCV in the sera of infected individuals. This binding was found to be mediated by the HCV E2 glycoprotein and could be efficiently inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan treatment.

The Patriots came in looking for their sixth straight win. After forcing the Colts to a quick three-and-out, the Patriots scored on their opening drive of the game, covering 89 yards, in 11 plays scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run by rookie Jonas Gray. The Colts responded, aided by a 46-yard completion from Luck to T. Y. Hilton, driving to the Patriots 13, but had to settle for an Adam Vinatieri 31-yard field goal to bring the score to 7-3. The Patriots then drove to their own 49, but safety Mike Adams intercepted a pass intended for Tyms at the Colts 6 for no gain. On their next possession, the Colts reached the Patriots 32, but McCourty intercepted Luck and returned it 10 yards back to the Patriots 32. From there the Patriots struck on an 11-play, 68-yard drive, scoring on Gray's 2-yard touchdown run, extending the lead to 14-3. The Patriots forced a three-and-out, but on the third play of the Patriots next drive, Brady was intercepted by Adams again, who returned it 10 yards to the Patriots 23. With the fabulous field position, it took the Colts just three plays for Luck to find Hakeem Nicks on a 10-yard touchdown pass, making the score 14-10 with less than a minute remaining in the first half. After taking the kickoff, the Patriots restarted with an 8 play, 80-yard drive scoring on a  2-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, extending the lead to 21-10. The Colts drove to the Patriots 40 on their next drive, and Vinatieri was good from 53 yards away to trim the deficit to 21-13. The Patriots struck with another touchdown, with Brady passing for 56 yards on a 10-play, 80-yard drive before Gray scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and increasing the Patriots lead to 28-13. The Colts pulled back into the game on their next drive, with Luck completing 5 passes on the next drive for 77 yards, capping it off with his 1-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Castonzo, pulling the game back to 28-20. Despite the effort from Luck and the offense, the Colt defense had no answer for the Patriots, with them driving 80 more yards in 10 more plays, scoring on Gray's 1-yard touchdown run, his fourth, increasing the lead to 35-20 with just 8:43 remaining. The Colts actually stuffed Gray for a two-yard loss at the Colts 31 which would've made it 4th-and-4, but a 15-yard face mask penalty on Jerrell Freeman moved the ball to the 14 and Gray scored 4 plays later. Four straight incompletions gave the Patriots the ball at the Colts 32. After two three-yard runs by Gray, Tom Brady threw a short pass to Gronkowski who broke it off for a 26-yard touchdown, effectively ending the game and clinching the Patriots' sixth straight win. The game also saw several skirmishes between Gronkowski and Sergio Brown, with Gronkowski throwing Brown into an NBC camera after the play on Gray's 4th touchdown. Gronkowski referred to this incident as throwing Sergio Brown \\"out of the club\\" for talking trash all game, including posting Gronk's stats on Twitter during the game. Jonas Gray broke out, running all over the Colts for 201 yards and 4 touchdowns on 37 carries. Tom Brady threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns, but threw two interceptions. The Patriots scored on every drive of the second half with exception of their final drive of the game which was used to run out the clock. Luck threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns, but the running game was a non-factor, totaling just 19 yards on 16 carries, with Trent Richardson running 6 times for 0 yards.

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.\\n\\nTwo geologists were researching agents of landscape change.

Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.

The paragraph then goes to describe an earlier fortress called Baris which is accepted as having been located on the site where later stood Antonia Fortress. And so I think it can be concluded from all this that Josephus has described what was originally Baris as being renamed Acre by Antiochos IV Epiphanes shortly before Maccabean revolt against him broke out; and therefore we may conclude further that if one wished to know what City contained Antonia Fortress, you could say it was Jerusalem but with reference to its Hellenistic name rather than after Rome re-"},{"source":"Once upon a time there a little girl named Ana.

The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said. \\nWhat was signed into law on Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry? \\nI was going to say \\"A bill requiring women seeking an abortion to view a picture of the embryo and hear a description of its development\\".

The climate of the Mesozoic was varied, alternating between warming and cooling periods. Overall, however, the Earth was hotter than it is today. Non-avian dinosaurs appeared in the Late Triassic and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates early in the Jurassic, occupying this position for about 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous.

The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings.

To better define the function of Rfx6 in early endoderm development we cloned the Xenopus homologue. Expression of rfx6 begins early, showing broad expression throughout the anterior endoderm; at later stages rfx6 expression becomes restricted to the endocrine cells of the gut and pancreas. Morpholino knockdown of rfx6 caused a loss of pancreas marker expression, as well as other abnormalities. Co-injection of exogenous wild-type rfx6 rescued the morpholino phenotype in Xenopus tadpoles, whereas attempts to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype using mutant rfx6 based on Mitchell-Riley patients were unsuccessful. To better define the pleiotropic effects, we performed microarray analyses of gene expression in knockdown foregut tissue. In addition to pancreatic defects, the microarray analyses revealed downregulation of lung, stomach and heart markers and an upregulation of kidney markers. We verified these results using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Based on the different rfx6 expression patterns and our functional analyses, we propose that rfx6 has both early and late functions. In early development Rfx6 plays a broad role, being essential for development of most anterior endodermal organs.

The story is outlined below and illustrated in Figure 19.9. The Love Canal disaster actually began back in the mid 1900s. The disaster continues even today. Starting in the early 1940s, a big chemical company put thousands of barrels of chemical waste into an old canal. Over the next 10 years, the company dumped almost 22,000 tons of chemicals into the ground! In the early 1950s, the company covered over the barrels in the canal with soil. Then they sold the land to the city for just a dollar. The city needed the land in order to build an elementary school. The company warned the city that toxic waste was buried there. But they thought the waste was safe. The school and hundreds of homes were also built over the old canal. As it turned out, the cheap price was no bargain. Chemicals started leaking from the barrels. Chemicals seeped into basements. Chemicals bubbled up to the surface of the ground. In some places, plants wouldnt even grow on the soil. People noticed bad smells. Many got sick, especially the children. Residents wanted to know if the old chemicals were the cause. But they had a hard time getting officials to listen. So they demonstrated and demanded answers. Finally, the soil was tested and was found to be contaminated with harmful chemicals. For example, it contained a lot of lead and mercury. Both can cause permanent damage to the human nervous system. The school was closed. More than 200 homes were evacuated. Much of the Love Canal neighborhood was bulldozed away. The area had a massive clean-up effort. The cleanup cost millions of dollars. More than three decades later, much of Love Canal is still too contaminated to be safe for people. Love Canal opened peoples eyes to toxic waste burial. They realized there must be other Love Canals all over the country. Thousands of contaminated sites were found. The Superfund Act was passed in 1980. The law required that money be set aside for cleanup of toxic waste sites, like the Elizabeth Copper Mine in Vermont (see the far-right image in Figure 19.9). The law also required safer disposal of hazardous waste in the future. Love Canal highlighted the problem of pollution by hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is any waste that is dangerous to the health of people or the environment. It may be dangerous because it is toxic, corrosive, flammable, or explosive. Toxic waste is poisonous. Toxic waste may cause cancer or birth defects in people. It may also harm other living things. Corrosive waste is highly reactive with other substances. Corrosive waste may cause burns or destroy other materials that it touches. Flammable waste can burn easily. It may also give off harmful fumes when it burns. Explosive waste is likely to explode. The risk of explosion may be greater if the waste is mixed with other substances. Table 19.1 shows some examples of hazardous waste. Look closely. Are any of these examples lurking around your home? Example Description Cars contain toxic fluids such as brake fluid. The fluids may also be corrosive and flammable. This photo shows one way the fluids can end up in the ground. Cars use gas and oil. These materials are toxic and flammable. They pollute the land when they leak or spill. Batteries contain toxic and corrosive materials. People often toss them in the trash, but they should be disposed of properly. Electronics, such as old computers, contain toxic chem- icals. They may be sent to landfills where the toxic materials end up in the ground. Medical waste can contain many hazards: Human body fluids may cause disease; old thermometers may contain toxic mercury; and pharmaceuticals may be toxic to people and other living things. Example Description Paints can be both toxic and flammable. Paints may spill on the ground or be thrown improperly in the trash. Chemicals are applied to farm fields and lawns. They include fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Many of these chemicals are toxic to people and other animals. The greatest source of hazardous waste is industry.

This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time.

The name Worlds End has been used since at least 1872, but its origins are uncertain.

The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially a result of the efforts of the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including the cabins that earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.\\nA wide variety of wildlife is found in the park, which is also part of an Important Bird Area.

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\\n\\n- The Amper (known in its upper reaches as the Ammer) is a river in southern Bavaria, Germany  the largest tributary of the Isar river.

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success.\\nDue to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work.

The band's sound is a mixture of hard rock and melodic pop music, often described in the music press as combining influences as diverse as The Beatles and 1980s-era Metallica. However, this characterization is denied by the band, who see their influences as being far broader, as shown in the song \\"29 X The Pain\\", which lists many of group leader Ginger's influences. Despite several top 20 singles and one top 10 album in Britain, the Wildhearts have not achieved major commercial success, owing in part to difficulties with record companies and many internal problems often relating to recreational drugs and depression.\\nContext: The Wildhearts next planned a double album, but East West vetoed this plan during the recording sessions. Instead the band released a collection of six of the more eclectic tracks on a fan club-only release entitled Fishing For Luckies in early 1995. This EP, which would be re-released in 1996 with more studio outtakes as Fishing for More Luckies, included the notable track \\"Geordie In Wonderland\\". Ginger offered this track to Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United F.C. as a potential team anthem, but was graciously turned down. The track was performed on Top of the Pops with Wolfsbane's Jeff Hateley, painted in Toon Army colours, on mandolin. Other noteworthy tracks included \\"If Life Is Like A Lovebank, I Want An Overdraft\\", also released as a single, and the 11:24 epic \\"Sky Babies.\\" Despite frequent fan requests, this track was rarely performed live, reputedly because of Danny McCormack's inability to remember his bass parts throughout the entire song. In 2003-2004 the band began to play \\"Sky Babies\\" at nearly every show with new bassist Jon Poole.  The second album proper was to be known as P.H.U.Q.. Midway through the recording sessions, Ginger (in a move he later claimed to regret) fired guitarist CJ, and some of the album's tracks were recorded without a second guitarist. P.H.U.Q. was released in May 1995 and reached #6 in the British charts, making it the band's most successful album. Shortly after the album's release, Mark Keds of Senseless Things was drafted as second guitarist, but lasted just one recording session, in which he appeared on the B-sides for the single \\"Just in Lust\\". Within a few weeks Keds was sacked after disappearing to Japan for a farewell tour with his old band. The Wildhearts were again down to a three-piece (Ginger, McCormack, and Battersby) for a few months, and performed a few gigs in this incarnation. The band resolved to return to a two-guitar formation, and after requesting demos and holding auditions, hired the previously unknown Jef Streatfield.  By late 1995 the band were finally fed up with their record label and set out to tour Japan and the UK, determined that they would split up unless East West would release them from their contract. The tours were a resounding success and eventually the band managed to escape their record contract.\\nQuestion: What was the Wildhearts' double album named?.

Keywords Highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV · PA-X · ALI · Pathogenesis · Mice Abstract PA-X is a novel discovered accessory protein encoded by the PA mRNA. Our previous study demonstrated that PA-X decreases the virulence of a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 in mice. However, the underlying mechanism of virulence attenuation associated with PA-X is still unknown. In this study, we compared two PA-X-deficient mutant viruses and the parental virus in terms of induction of pathology and manipulation of host response in the mouse lung, stimulation of cell death and PA nuclear accumulation. We first found that down-regulated PA-X expression markedly aggravated the acute lung injury of the infected mice early on day 1 post-infection (p.i.). We then determined that loss of PA-X expression induced higher levels of cytokines, chemokines and complement-derived peptides (C3a and C5a) in the lung, especially at early time point's p.i. In addition, in vitro assays showed that the PA-X-deficient viruses enhanced cell death and increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mammalian cells. Moreover, we also found that PA nuclear accumulation of the PA-X-null viruses accelerated in MDCK cells. These results demonstrate that PA-X decreases the level of complement components, ROS, cell death and inflammatory response, \\n Title: PA-X-associated early alleviation of the acute lung injury contributes to the attenuation of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in mice","target":"False","rationale":"The title of the paper includes information about the main findings and conclusions of the study, which include that PA-X expression decreases the virulence of a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain (A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010) in mice by early alleviation of acute lung injury.

However, European traders brought Lutheranism to Africa beginning in the 17th century as they settled along the coasts. During the first half of the 19th century, missionary activity in Africa expanded, including preaching by missionaries, translation of the Bible, and education. Lutheranism came to India beginning with the work of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg, where a community totaling several thousand developed, complete with their own translation of the Bible, catechism, their own hymnal, and system of Lutheran schools. In the 1840s, this church experienced a revival through the work of the Leipzig Mission, including Karl Graul. After German missionaries were expelled in 1914, Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous, yet preserved their Lutheran character. In recent years India has relaxed its anti-religious conversion laws, allowing a resurgence in missionary work. In Latin America, missions began to serve European immigrants of Lutheran background, both those who spoke German and those who no longer did. These churches in turn began to evangelize those in their areas who were not of European background, including indigenous peoples. In 1892, the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan. Although work began slowly and a major setback occurred during the hardships of WWII. Lutheranism there has survived and become self-sustaining. After missionaries to China, including those of the Lutheran Church of China, were expelled, they began ministry in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the latter which became a center of Lutheranism in Asia. The Lutheran Mission in New Guinea, though founded only in 1953, became the largest Lutheran mission in the world in only several decades. Through the work of native lay evangelists, many tribes of diverse languages were reached with the Gospel.\\n\\nDid the missionaries go to Hong Kong first, or New Guinea?","target":"Hong Kong","rationale":"In order to answer this question, the missionaries who went to Hong Kong first or New Guinea?, we need more information about when they went.

While Hong Kong became a center of Lutheranism in Asia after being expelled from China as well as Taiwan according to other passages. Since there are no specific dates mentioned about how long each event took place (e.g., \\"a few months\\"), we could conclude that these events occurred within several years.

In 1724, Asif Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan Suba, named the region Hyderabad Deccan, and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asif Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. The death of Asif Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of Asif Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the treaty of Machilipatnam, surrendering the coastal region to the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent.In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. In response to regular threats from Hyder Ali (Dalwai of Mysore), Baji Rao I (Peshwa of the Maratha Empire), and Basalath Jung (Asif Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau), the Nizam signed a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the British Indian Army to occupy Bolarum (modern Secunderabad) to protect the state's capital, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British.Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of Hussain Sagar Lake, and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services, underground drainage, running water, electricity, telecommunications, universities, industries, and Begumpet Airport.

It is not known, however, to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient. To investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli, 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm. Ergonovine, hyperventilation, handgrip, cold pressor, and exercise-tests, were carried out in all 28 patients. In the last 15 patients histamine was also administered. Spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96% of patients, by hyperventilation in 54%, by histamine in 47%, by exercise in 46%, and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11% and 7%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions. In the same individual, spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli, although with a different mechanism of action, in 82% of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39%. Tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity. These results suggest that in patients with variant angina, a local nonspecific supersensitivity rather than an abnormal specific agonist-receptor interaction plays a major role in the genesis of coronary arterial spasm. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Local coronary supersensitivity to diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli in patients with variant angina. option2: Pericarditis and ulcerative colitis.","target":"Local coronary supersensitivity to diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli in patients with variant angina","rationale":"The first candidate title (\\"Local coronary supersensitivity to diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli in patients with variant angina\\") provides a concise, accurate summary of the main topic of the article.
