The central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the dose for normal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the therapeutic ratio, and all radiotherapy techniques are designed to enhance this ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a number of techniques. One of the most prevalent techniques for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in Figure 32.13. A narrow beam of radiation is passed through the patient from a variety of directions with a common crossing point in the tumor. This concentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue. The external radiation can be x-rays, 60 Co γ rays, or ionizing-particle beams produced by accelerators. Accelerator-produced beams of neutrons, π-mesons , and heavy ions such as nitrogen nuclei have been employed, and these can be quite effective. These particles have larger QFs or RBEs and sometimes can be better localized, producing a greater therapeutic ratio. But accelerator radiotherapy is much more expensive and less frequently employed than other forms.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- UV light\\n\\n- separation\\n\\n- destruction\\n\\n- radiation\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"radiation","rationale":"The paragraph states that radiotherapy is effective against cancer because it has a large impact on the cells inside the tumor. The rest of the first sentence says that since cancerous tissue reproduces rapidly, it's more sensitive to radiation compared to normal cells.

The total energy conversion rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and is divided among various systems in the body, as shown in Table 7.4. The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes have a greater BMR due to this last factor.\\n\\n\\nQ: The rate at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the what?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- hormonal rate\\n\\n- calorie rate\\n\\n- life cycle\\n\\n- metabolic rate\\n\\nA:","target":"metabolic rate","rationale":"The question asks us to identify the term used for \\"the rate at which the body uses food energy\\".

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century \\nQuestion: What neologism can be applied to Madame White Snake?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

The term does not necessarily have to be something that has never been used before, but it could refer to common words and phrases being utilized in new ways (e.g., using 'neologistic' as an adjective).\\nWhile one could argue that 'liberated woman' may fit this definition because of its use in modern feminist discourse rather than historical contexts, there are more appropriate answers available (femme fatale/dangerous feminine sexuality) which do much better at conveying what the passage describes about her character and behavior."},{"source":"Someone else who was mowing the lawn borrowed my lighter ( I have it especially to use for fondues .

Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn.

It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).\\nThe passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.\\n\\n- Plumage (\\"feather\\") refers both to the layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies, and may vary with age classes. Within species there can be different colour morphs.\\n\\n- New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\\n\\n- A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.\\n\\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\\n\\n- The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.\\n\\n- Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.\\n\\n- The myna (also known as mynah) is a bird of the starling family (Sturnidae). This is a group of passerine birds which are native to southern Asia, especially India. Several species have been introduced to areas like North America, Australia, South Africa, Fiji and New Zealand, especially the common myna which is often regarded as an invasive species. Often known as \\"Selarang\\" in Singapore, due to their high population located at the area.\\n\\n- The Sahara (\\", 'the Greatest Desert') is the largest hot desert and the third largest desert in the world after Antarctica and the Arctic. Its area of is comparable to the area of the United States.\\n\\n- Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.\\n\\n- Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.\\n\\n- The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area).\\n\\n- Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African.\\n\\n- Amino acids are biologically important organic compounds containing amine (-NH) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side-chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, though other elements are found in the side-chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (-), beta- (-), gamma- (-) or delta- (-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side-chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acids comprise the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles, cells and other tissues. Outside proteins, amino acids perform critical roles in processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.\\n\\n- Lamprotornis is a large genus of glossy - starlings all of which occur in Africa south of the Sahara . They have glossy blue or green upper parts , which is due to hollow melanin granules arranged in a single layer near the feather barbule 's surface . This unique arrangement led to some glossy starlings formerly placed in the genus Spreo being transferred to Lamprotornis , since they shared this feature ( but see also below ) . The under parts of these species lack iridescence . They may be blue , purple , yellow or brown . Most Lamprotornis starlings have striking yellow or red irides and some have long tails . These glossy starlings are found in a variety of habitats from forests to open woodland and gardens . They nest in tree holes , either natural , or made by woodpeckers or barbets , and some will use man - made structures . Most species are resident apart from seasonal or local movement , but Shelley 's starling is migratory . Most species are gregarious outside the breeding season . Lamprotornis glossy - starlings are omnivorous and mostly feed on the ground , although they will take fruit from trees . Some will feed on or near large mammals to find insects .\\n\\n- Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. The name \\"Sturnidae\\" comes from the Latin word for starling, \\"sturnus\\". Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as North America, Hawaii and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific, the common myna is indeed common.\\n\\n- Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas.\\n\\n- The common starling (\\"Sturnus vulgaris\\"), also known as the European starling, or in the British Isles just the starling, is a medium-sized passerine bird in the starling family, Sturnidae. It is about long and has glossy black plumage with a metallic sheen, which is speckled with white at some times of year. The legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer; young birds have browner plumage than the adults. It is a noisy bird, especially in communal roosts and other gregarious situations, with an unmusical but varied song. Its gift for mimicry has been noted in literature including the \\"Mabinogion\\" and the works of Pliny the Elder and William Shakespeare.\\n\\n- The common myna (\\"Acridotheres tristis\\"), sometimes spelled mynah, also sometimes known as \\"Indian myna\\", is a member of the family Sturnidae (starlings and mynas) native to Asia. An omnivorous open woodland bird with a strong territorial instinct, the myna has adapted extremely well to urban environments.\\n\\n- Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\\n\\n- India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area.

Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981.

As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them.\\n\\nHint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system.","target":"Enterprise","rationale":"This question is based on the line in the passage: “The main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise isn’t.” Red Giants are stars with an enormous mass like our sun at the final stage of their life cycle when they stop fusing hydrogen due to lack of fuel.

Organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients, particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient. In Seattle as many as 40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics. Although these systems are growing and improving health care, many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement. Emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities. It has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred: time to starting any of the rescue procedures, use of electrical defibrillation when indicated, use of epinephrine, and adequacy of the technique of basic life support, particularly the ventilation component. To provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time, defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit. With the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators, first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims. The use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics, however, must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data in the form of percentages, such as \\"40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation\\" and \\"as many as 40%\\".

He led the league in receiving touchdowns twice, and is a member of the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team. He is the Bears' all-time leader in receiving touchdowns, with 50.\\n\\nAfter the war, he continued his career with the Bears. In 1945 he had 543 yards and six touchdowns, and in 1946 had 337 yards and five touchdowns. Three of his touchdowns in 1946 came in a 27-21 win over the Los Angeles Rams in week seven. The Bears defeated the New York Giants 24-14 in the 1946 NFL Championship Game, which gave Kavanaugh his third league championship with the team. The first touchdown of the game was a 21-yard pass from Luckman to Kavanaugh. After the season, he was named to the United Press All-NFL first team. Kavanaugh had his most productive season statistically in 1947. He had career highs with 32 receptions, 881 yards, and 13 touchdowns. He set a Bears record by recording a receiving touchdown in seven straight games, a streak that began with a three-touchdown game against the Boston Yanks in week six. His 13 receiving touchdowns led the league, and he earned his second straight first-team All-NFL selection from the United Press.  Kavanaugh was named to his third straight All-NFL first team in 1948, and he again led the league in receiving touchdowns in 1949, with nine. His most productive single-game yardage performance came in his final season, in 1950 against the Yanks, as he caught eight passes for 177 yards and a touchdown.  Kavanaugh spent a total of eight seasons in Chicago. He spent the majority of his career catching passes from quarterbacks Sid Luckman and Johnny Lujack.

She was the one to eventually stop what they were doing and walk away.\\n\\nI condensed alot of it but if the specifics of what happened are needed I can edit it in later or make another post later.\\n\\n\\\\---------------------(What I have done)\\n\\nSo knowing all that I can tell you how I've been handling it.\\n\\nFor my best friend I've done everything I can to avoid seeing him or acknowledging him in the apartment. I've made plans to move out as soon as I have the place available I'm gone. I felt I gave him his chance to explain his side and he shrugged his shoulders. He also didn't say another word or even a sorry till 3 weeks later while he was shitfaced. I can forgive mistakes even monumental ones like that but lying about it then not planning on telling me and the way he went about it just seems sleazy and malicious. also he is quite a heavy drinker so he can handle his drinks and he wasn't that bad off when I went to bed.\\n\\nFor the SO at first I told her to be moved out by new years. She was honest she knew she fucked up and she hated herself for it. She beat her self up enough so I was perfectly content with acting like nothing happened until she moved out to allow her to have a smooth transition. Recently though we have been talking about possibly working things out and I'm just very unsure of it. \\n\\nOn one hand she was honest with when in reality that's a hard thing for most people to admit to someone knowing full well you'll earn nothing but that person's anger and hate in return. On the other honesty can't get you out of everything nor can alcohol as an excuse and if we continue on it will be very hard for me to remember this and have it lorded over her when she might be acting shitty towards me. I know that isn't right but I'm human too and I don't know how I might feel later down the road. I also feel that maybe the part that wants to work on it is just being weak afraid of being alone after losing the only 2 people I really interact with outside of work. If that's so then that's unfair to her.\\n\\nI've talked to some friends at work about it which is the closest petty thing I've done to the best friend however I legitimately wanted their opinion (2 older males) but part of me did feel like I was exposing a fraud. They were surprised considering how close we we're but they think I should give him another chance or some sort of leniency.\\n\\n\\\\-------------------------(TL;DR)\\n\\nSo after all this AITA for completely shunning my best friend while forgiving my SO and possibly letting her back into my life fully","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author's best friend had sex with the author's girlfriend while she was drunk. The best friend did not initially admit to having sex with her and acted as if he only made out with her, which suggests he tried to hide his actions from the author. He also did not apologize right away, but waited until 3 weeks later (presumably after the author learned more details) when he was drunk to apologize. These actions indicate that the best friend acted unethically and irresponsibly.\\n\\nIn addition, the girl cheated on her boyfriend while she was extremely intoxicated, which suggests that she may have been unable to make informed decisions or act in a responsible manner due to being too inebriated. Therefore, it would be unfair for him to completely blame her for what happened between them because of this lack of responsibility on both their parts during an ethical lapse in judgment by both parties.\\\\nThe answer is \\"\\"RIGHT\\"\\" because it seems that both parties were at fault for cheating on each other, but neither party is entirely wrong here either.\\""},{"source":"Q: Management programs based on population-regulating factors have helped prevent the extinction of many?\\n\\n\\nRead this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:\\n\\n\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- abundant species\\n\\n- keystone species\\n\\n- omnivores\\n\\n- endangered species\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"endangered species","rationale":"The paragraph discusses the extinction of a species and its population.

She ticks pretty much every category when it comes to what I believe is the perfect girlfriend, which makes sense that my best friend would go for her seeing as we are hella tight buds with heaps of common interests.I have never really felt alone before; I've always been able to keep entertained/comfortable. But when I see them together, I would feel sort of empty or cold (mainly in the chest). With his previous girlfriends, I would never have this feeling. This is essentially the reason why I'm confused about what I'm feeling.Now here comes the twist, recently she's been a lot more physical. She's started to be closer whenever she's near me. It started off as a shoulder to shoulder thing, but has escalated to lying on top of me (in a non sexual way). And she would also sort of curl up next to me in the space between my arm and my chest. She's hitting me with heaps of red flags here.I'm generally a positive person, and so my thoughts as to why she's being this way is because she's not getting this attention from my best friend. And so she's doing what any normal person would do, which is getting attention from another source - me (the dickhead with no backbone).I have definitely noticed a connection between the two of us, but I'm finding it difficult determining if it's a friendship thing, or something more. The whole decision on whether or not I'm feeling lonely, is really getting difficult with the way she has been acting recently. Her being near me is a great way to feel less isolated, but it's such a temporary feeling.Help the lonely boi.Edit 1: I kind of still want to be friends with her, like after whatever happens. After reading through some of the replies, most suggest ditching her. I've noticed that I feel really comfortable around her in the same way I'm comfortable with my best friend. The only difference is that I've known him for what seems like forever, and her only for a year. I genuinely believe that her and I could be bestfriends.Edit 2: I've always had that need for things I feel I can't have, and in this situation it's the desire to not be lonely. Whenever she is around me, I no longer have the feeling of being lonely. But then the feeling of guilt takes over, for the fact that she is my best friends girlfriend and I should be keeping my boundaries with her.","target":"AUTHOR","rationale":"The author is feeling confused and conflicted about their best friend's girlfriend, who they are attracted to.

Atlanta would come right back as quarterback Drew Brees was sacked by free safety Thomas DeCoud, causing him to fumble and allow defensive end Kroy Biermann to return the ball 4 yards for a touchdown.

Fortunately, cornerback Tracy Porter's key interception (helped from linebacker Jonathan Vilma's tip) lead to Brees finding Thomas on a 1-yard touchdown pass.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a...\\n\\nGuess a valid title for it!","target":"Of Human Feelings","rationale":"The context discusses the life and career of Ornette Coleman, a jazz musician who pioneered free jazz in the 1960s.

She won five Grand Slam singles titles, thirteen Grand Slam women's doubles titles, winning a calendar-year doubles Grand Slam in 1998, and seven Grand Slam mixed doubles titles; for a combined total of twenty-five major titles. In addition, she won the season-ending WTA Finals two times in singles and three times in doubles, and an Olympic silver medal.\\n\\nIn 2001, Switzerland, with Hingis and Roger Federer on its team, won the Hopman Cup. Hingis didn't drop a set in any of her singles matches during the event, defeating Tamarine Tanasugarn, Nicole Pratt, Amanda Coetzer, and Monica Seles. Federer was later quoted as saying: \\"I learned a lot from her, especially the two years I was here - once as a hitting partner and once as a partner with Martina. Definitely she helped me to become the player I am today.\\"  Hingis reached her fifth consecutive Australian Open final in 2001, defeating both of the Williams sisters en route, before losing to Jennifer Capriati. She briefly ended her coaching relationship with her mother Melanie early in the year but had a change of heart two months later just before the French Open. 2001 was her least successful year in several seasons, with only three tournament victories in total. She lost her No. 1 ranking for the last time (to Jennifer Capriati) on 14 October 2001. In that same month, Hingis underwent surgery on her right ankle.  Coming back from injury, Hingis won the Australian Open doubles final at the start of 2002 (again teaming with Anna Kournikova) and reached a sixth straight Australian Open final in singles, again facing Capriati. Hingis led by a set and 4-0 and had four match points but lost in three sets. In May 2002, she needed another ankle ligament operation, this time on her left ankle. After that, she continued to struggle with injuries and was not able to recapture her best form.

In the final home game for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing, 17–10, thus giving the Cowboys their first conference championship. The 49ers sent five players to the 1970 Pro Bowl that season, including MVP veteran quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver Gene Washington (49ers), and linebacker Dave Wilcox. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season the 49ers moved from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.\\nDid the 49ers score fewer points to become champions of the NFC West or in their first playoff game?","target":"first playoff game","rationale":"In the early game, Giants were crushed by Rams 31-3. In wet and rainy conditions in Oakland where 49ers dominated Raiders 38-7. Therefore we could conclude that 49ers scored fewer points to become champions of NFC West than their first playoff game (38 < 17)."},{"source":"Answer a question about this article:\\nPrior Zelda games have employed a theme of two separate, yet connected, worlds. In A Link to the Past, Link travels between a \\"Light World\\" and a \\"Dark World\\"; in Ocarina of Time, as well as in Oracle of Ages, Link travels between two different time periods. The Zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series' latest installment. It was suggested that Link transform into a wolf, much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the Dark World of A Link to the Past.[m] The story of the game was created by Aonuma, and later underwent several changes by scenario writers Mitsuhiro Takano and Aya Kyogoku. Takano created the script for the story scenes, while Kyogoku and Takayuki Ikkaku handled the actual in-game script. Aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed The Minish Cap for the Game Boy Advance. When he returned, he found the Twilight Princess team struggling. Emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made Link's character unbelievable. Aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in Phantom Hourglass, which was being developed with touch controls for the Nintendo DS. At the same time, the Wii was under development with the code name \\"Revolution\\". Miyamoto thought that the Revolution's pointing device, the Wii Remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and suggested that Aonuma consider using it.[n]\\nAonuma left the Twilight Princess development team to work on which other game?","target":"The Minish Cap","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that the Zelda team was struggling with a new idea.

Only minor similarity is found outside this catalytic domain, as expected for receptors that have different ligand specificities and generate different biological signals. The EGF receptor is a single polypeptide chain but the insulin receptor consists of distinct alpha and beta subunits that function as an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric receptor complex. Provoked by this major structural difference in two receptors that carry out parallel functions, we have designed a chimaeric receptor molecule comprising the extracellular portion of the insulin receptor joined to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the EGF receptor to investigate whether one ligand will activate the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor for the other ligand. We show here that the EGF receptor kinase domain of the chimaeric protein, expressed transiently in simian cells, is activated by insulin binding. This strongly suggests that insulin and EGF receptors employ closely related or identical mechanisms for signal transduction across the plasma membrane. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data that describes the structural similarity between the insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors.

Adult acute myeloid leukemia affects the body by disrupting the normal balance of blood cells in the body. Reduced levels of white blood cells, which normally defend the body from infection, can lead to higher chances of catching secondary diseases. Other symptoms of leukemia can include: 1  pain in the bones or joints, sometimes causing a limp. 2  swollen lymph nodes (sometimes called swollen glands) in the neck, groin, or elsewhere. 3  an abnormally tired feeling. 4  poor appetite. 5  fevers with no other symptoms. Drugs and other therapies can prevent or manage many side effects. Both cancer therapy and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can sometimes produce side effects. For most patients, side effects are temporary and subside once the body adjusts to therapy or when therapy is completed. For other patients, side effects can be more severe, sometimes requiring hospitalization. Before you undergo treatment, talk with your doctor about potential side effects. Leukemias are cancers that start in cells that would normally develop into different types of blood cells. Here we will talk about acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has many other names, including acute myelocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. “Acute” means that this leukemia can progress quickly if not treated, and would probably be fatal in a few months. In acute leukemia blood cells are very abnormal, increase rapidly and worsen quickly. In chronic leukemia the abnormal blood cells can still do their work early in the disease but slowly get worse. The four common types of leukemia are: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer. It usually begins in cells that turn into white blood cells. Sometimes, though, AML can start in other types of blood-forming cells. Although there’s no cure, there are treatments that can make a big difference. What Happens. Acute myeloid leukemia starts in the bone marrow. This is the soft inner parts of bones. With acute types of leukemia such as AML, bone marrow cells don't mature the way they're supposed to. These immature cells, often called blast cells, keep building up. You may hear other names for acute myeloid leukemia. Doctors may call it: Acute myelocytic leukemia Some long-term and late effects for blood cancer survivors can linger for months or years after therapy. Blood cancer survivors don't always have serious long-term or late effects of treatment. For those who do, some long-term effects, such as fatigue, can linger for months or years after therapy. Late effects, such as medical conditions like heart disease and other cancers, don't appear until years after treatment ends. Effects can range from mild to severe. Talk with your doctor about possible long-term and late effects. 1  Your risk for developing long-term or late effects can be influenced by your: 2  Treatment type and duration. 3  Age at the time of treatment. 4  Gender. 5  Overall health.

Passage:Still wines from the Champagne region were known before medieval times. The Romans were the first to plant vineyards in this area of north-east France, with the region being tentatively cultivated by the 5th century. In fact, cultivation was initially slow due to the unpopular edict by Emperor Domitian that all colonial vines must be uprooted. When Emperor Probus, the son of a gardener, rescinded the edict, a temple to Bacchus was erected, and the region started to produce a red, light, and fruity wine that contrasted with heavier Italian brews often fortified with resin and herbs. Later, churches owned vineyards and monks produced wine for use in the sacrament of Eucharist. French kings were traditionally anointed in Reims, and champagne was served as part of coronation festivities. The Champenois were envious of the reputation of the wines made by their Burgundian neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However, the northerly climate of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making red wine. At the far extremes of sustainable viticulture, the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of acidity and low sugar levels. The wines would be lighter bodied and thinner than the Burgundy wines they were seeking to outdo.\\n Links: a. Middle Ages b. Red Wine c. Probus (emperor) d.

Rick Scott for the state’s failure to expand Medicaid. During the second governor’s debate, which was held on Oct. 15, 2014, at Broward College, Crist said of Medicaid expansion, \\"\\"In addition to the $51 billion it would bring to the state over the next 10 years, some studies indicate it would create about 120,000 jobs. That's the right thing to do.\\"\\" That’s nearly double the number of new jobs that Crist cited this summer. If Florida expands Medicaid, would that lead to 120,000 more jobs? Studies about Medicaid and jobs Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility, with the federal government paying 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The expansion would have led to 800,000 to 1 million additional Floridians signing up for Medicaid. (That’s mostly due to new Floridians who would be eligible and also because some who are already eligible but haven’t signed up would enroll for the program after publicity.) Scott initially opposed Medicaid expansion but switched his position in 2013 when he came out in support of it. But Scott didn’t lobby the GOP-led Legislature, which ultimately rejected the expansion. He hasn’t talked about it much on the campaign trail. Studies predicting job growth are based on the idea that as states expand Medicaid, new patients will access medical services they haven’t used in the past. Extra revenue will allow health care facilities to hire new workers. But the number of jobs predicted in each study varies depending upon the methodology. We only found one study that went as high as the 120,000 number Crist cited in the debate. And that study was conducted by a supporter of the expansion. Crist was citing the Florida Hospital Association’s 2013 analysis that predicts about 120,000 jobs. The association commissioned the study done by University of Florida researchers. During the debate, Crist didn’t specify any time frame. Direct jobs accounted for about one-third of the jobs, while the remainder included suppliers or secondary spending, such as when a doctor buys a new house or car. Other studies cited much lower figures for job growth. For example, Moody’s, a financial analysis firm that doesn’t have a position on the health care law, last year predicted Medicaid expansion would create 10,000 to 30,000 jobs over 10 years in Florida. The White House Council of Economic Advisers projected 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017 in Florida. That study was part of the Obama administration’s promotion of the Affordable Care Act. The White House study relies in part on the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which some residents got Medicaid through a lottery. Research showed people in Medicaid got preventative tests such as mammograms, cholesterol screening and pap smears compared to the control group. The White House predicts that Medicaid expansion would allow tens of thousands of Floridians to get those preventative tests. Experts weigh in on studies So why the massive differences on the job predictions? The numbers vary based on different economic models used and other assumptions. PolitiFact Florida interviewed several experts on the studies after the first debate, held on Telemundo, when Crist made a similar claim about new jobs from expanding Medicaid. Dan White, the senior economist who authored the Moody’s study, said that the hospital association study appears to assume that everyone who signs up under the Medicaid expansion will generate new spending. But at least some of those people who would have signed up for Medicaid were already accessing some medical services -- albeit inefficiently in emergency rooms. \\"\\"They are treating all the money coming into Medicaid expansion as new medical spending in Florida, but some of those people are already spending money,\\"\\" White said. \\"\\"The crux of our analysis is shifting who is paying for it. It might be true that those people support 120,000 jobs, but maybe 10,000 to 30,000 are new jobs.\\"\\" Some experts on Medicaid expansion told PolitiFact Florida that an infusion of federal dollars for Medicaid expansion would lead to some job growth, but they questioned pinpointing a specific number. \\"\\"Pumping federal dollars into the state is likely to be stimulative, but an exact job calculation (given the many concurrent policy changes) is difficult,\\"\\" Harvard professor of health economics Katherine Baicker told PolitiFact Florida. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s impossible to make a jobs prediction. \\"\\"I would guess there would be some short-term employment gains, but the long term would be more problematic as bills become due,\\"\\" he said. \\"\\"But even in the short term, I am skeptical of both the size and precision of this estimate.\\"\\" Though most of the experts we interviewed agreed that there would be some job growth, University of Chicago economist Casey B. Mulligan argues that increasing Medicaid will reduce employment because people will no longer need to work full-time to get health insurance. \\"\\"Medicaid makes it less painful to have a low income, so people have less incentive to take actions to prevent their incomes from getting low,\\"\\" he previously told PolitiFact. \\"\\"Not everyone acts that way, but enough do that a Medicaid expansion would depress employment nationally.\\"\\" Our ruling Crist said \\"\\"some studies indicate\\"\\" expanding Medicaid would \\"\\"create about 120,000 jobs.\\"\\" Crist was referring to one study done for the Florida Hospital Association, a supporter of Medicaid expansion. That study predicted about 120,000 new jobs. There have been several studies that predict job growth related to Medicaid expansion, with one study putting the figure as low as 10,000 jobs. Crist cherry-picked the study with the highest statistic and omitted that it was done for an association that supports the expansion. Most economists and Medicaid experts say that it’s likely that the infusion of federal cash would lead to some jobs, but it is difficult to pinpoint the number.\\" Claim: \\"If Florida expanded Medicaid, \\"\\"some studies indicate it would create about 120,000 jobs.\\"","target":"1","rationale":"The claim \\"If Florida expanded Medicaid, \\"\\"some studies indicate it would create about 120,000 jobs.\\" does not directly contradict the evidence in the paragraph.

Although Keats didn't receive much formal literary education, his own studies and passion brought him much success. Additionally, his own life situation influenced his poetry greatly. \\nGrowing up as a young kid in London in a lower, middle-class family, the young John didn't attend a private school, but went to public school in Enfield, near his home. His teachers and his family's friends regarded him as an optimistic boy who liked playing and fighting much more than minding his studies. After his father's death in the early 1800s, followed by his mother's passing away due to illness, he began to view life differently. He wanted to escape the world and did so by reading anything he could get his hands on.\\nAt around the age of 16, the teenage John Keats began studying under a surgeon so that he too might become a doctor. However, his literary appetite had taken too much of his time, especially with his addiction to the poetry of Edmund Spenser.

The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\\n\\n- A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development.

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.\\n\\n- A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.\\nA metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.\\n\\n- The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.\\n\\n- Three and One - half Fathom Ledge in Massachusetts , is a small barren rock in Massachusetts Bay , located within the city limits of Boston , USA .

Howard (Jeff Bridges), and Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) come together as the principal jockey, owner, and trainer of the championship horse Seabiscuit, rising from troubled times to achieve fame and success through their association with the horse. Red is the child of a Canadian family financially ruined by the Great Depression. In desperate need of money, the family leaves Red with a horse trainer. Red eventually becomes a jockey, but makes extra money through illegal boxing matches which left him blind in one eye. Howard is a clerk in a bicycle shop who gets asked by a passing motorist to repair his automobile, a technology which has recently been introduced. As a result, Howard becomes knowledgeable enough with automobiles to increase their performance and sell them as a dealer, eventually becoming the largest car dealer in California and one of the Bay Area's richest men. However, his son is killed in an automobile accident while driving the family car, which sends Howard into a bout of deep depression, which eventually results in his wife (Valerie Mahaffey) leaving him. On a trip to Mexico to obtain a divorce and to drown his sorrows, he meets Marcela Zabala (Elizabeth Banks). Marcela helps Howard overcome his depression, mainly through horse-riding. After marrying Marcela, Howard acquires a stable of horses and later has a chance encounter with the skilled and kindly horse trainer and drifter Smith. Howard hires Smith to manage his stables after Smith, who specializes in rehabilitating injured and abused horses, explains to Howard \\"You don't throw a whole life away just 'cause it's banged up a little bit\\". Smith convinces Howard to acquire the colt \\"Seabiscuit\\", who comes from noted lineage but had been deemed \\"incorrigible\\" by past handlers and was later broken and trained to lose against better horses. Smith is unable to find a jockey willing to deal with Seabiscuit's temperament, but after witnessing Red Pollard brawling with other stable boys, he sees in him a similar temperament to the feisty horse and decides to appoint him as Seabiscuit's jockey. Seabiscuit and Pollard become close and they begin to race. After overcoming early difficulties, such as a dismissive media and Pollard's anger issues and blind eye, Seabiscuit begins to earn considerable success and becomes an extremely popular underdog for the millions affected by the Great Depression. Inspired, Howard tries repeatedly to provoke a race with the mocking New York tycoon Samuel Riddle and his fearsome stallion \\"War Admiral\\", the top race horse in the country. Riddle eventually relents to a match race on his terms between War Admiral and Seabiscuit, but while the date approaches, Pollard is injured in a riding accident, fracturing his leg. When the doctor reports that he will be unable to ride again, Red suggests that Howard get an old friend, the successful jockey George Woolf (Gary Stevens) to be Seabiscuit's new rider. Red teaches Woolf about Seabiscuit's handling and mannerisms. At the match race, Seabiscuit upsets the heavy favorite, War Admiral, partly because of a secret that Pollard relates to Woolf, instructing him to hold him head to head with the other horse so he gets \\"a good look at the Admiral.\\" Later on, Seabiscuit is racing at Santa Anita when he is injured and has to stop. Red helps him to recover and get fit enough to race again. The last race is again at the Santa Anita, and Red rides him this time after putting a special self-made brace on his own leg to keep it stable. Woolf is on a different horse. Seabiscuit drops to last place and trails the pack, but Woolf holds back to be alongside Red and let Seabiscuit \\"get a good look\\". After a short conversation, Seabiscuit surges and wins the race. Red says, \\"You know, everyone thinks that we found this broken down horse and fixed him, but we didn't. He fixed us. Every one of us.

This was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser, and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the New Left. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek, Leo Strauss, Isaiah Berlin, Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"the analytic establishment","rationale":"The text mentions that from the end of WWII until 1971, political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world due to skepticism about normative judgments.

Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and isolated mountains, the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75 years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.Wind can also cause plants damage through sand abrasion. Strong winds...\\n\\nParagraph: John was studying plant varieties in different regions. He fist visited the Pacific Northwest. He found that the wind was constantly very strong there. He marked it as case A. Then he studied the plants in the Midwest. He found that on average the wind speed was very light there. He marked it as case B.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which case the tree line would be lower, case A or case B?","target":"case A","rationale":"Given the context, \\"the tree line would be lower\\" in case A because it is stated that wind can limit tree growth and high winds scour away thin soils through erosion. In addition, strong winds reduce tree growth on coasts and isolated mountains which suggests that the trees will not grow very tall if they are exposed to strong winds.\\nThe question states that there are no instances of high wind speeds in Case B so we can infer that this area does not experience conditions similar to those mentioned above. As a result, there likely aren't as many constraints limiting tree growth and thus we expect the trees here to grow taller than those in Case A where exposure to strong winds may have stunted their development"},{"source":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: \\n\\nQ: They were having an affair.

The empire, based around the Punjab region, existed from 1799 to 1849. It was forged, on the foundations of the Khalsa, under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839) from an array of autonomous Punjabi Misls. He consolidated many parts of northern India into a kingdom. He primarily used his highly disciplined Sikh army that he trained and equipped to be the equal of a European force. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well qualified generals for his army. In stages, he added the central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, the Peshawar Valley, and the Derajat to his kingdom. This came in the face of the powerful British East India Company. At its peak, in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, running along Sutlej river to Himachal in the east. This was among the last areas of the subcontinent to be conquered by the British. The first Anglo-Sikh war and second Anglo-Sikh war marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire.

I talked to my mom briefly about it and decided to just cry the rest out. This friend of mine had been sending me multiple messages to get my attention since I wasn't responding. I said \\"I'm just not good rn\\". Obviously, this is ambiguous and my friend was very right for asking what was wrong. But I told him that I already talked about it with someone, I don't feel like talking, and I'll tell him later. He kept pushing and saying to tell him what's wrong and that I don't normally act like this. (obviously, I don't normally have really shitty days). \\n\\nI kept politely declining for some time (I just counted 9 times I declined without being insulting but the last few had some attitude). This is when I finally was just do stressed and upset I couldn't take him spamming me over and over asking after I told him no. So I swore at him, asked if he could read, said he's an idiot, told him to fuck off, telling him that we'll talk later but if he keeps being pushy I'll block him (I did on one app because he kept calling and asking on that one too), that he's genuinely annoying me by asking repeatedly, telling him that he's driving me crazy, and saying that the only way I can get it through to him is apparently by being rude. (This is everything I said, I went back and checked each message). \\n\\nNow, he's saying that I was being rude because he cares for me and was worried, but I did say I would tell him later just not at that moment.\\n\\n So, am I the asshole for blowing up on him while he was worried about me?","target":"blowing up on a friend while I was in a bad mood","rationale":"The post describes an interaction between the author and their friend.

It is metabolized in humans to pinacidil N-oxide. To determine whether pinacidil's metabolism or effects were influenced by either liver disease or the subject's debrisoquin phenotype, eight patients with chronic stable cirrhosis and 13 healthy subjects were studied. Seven of the healthy volunteers were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin, whereas six were of the poor metabolizer phenotype. Neither the clearance of pinacidil nor the production of the N-oxide was altered by the subjects' debrisoquin phenotype. Cirrhosis produced a 50% reduction in pinacidil's clearance (20.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 42.1 +/- 5.1 L/hr; P less than 0.0005) and a prolongation in the elimination t1/2 from 3.9 +/- 0.3 to 6.1 +/- 0.6 hours (P less than 0.01). Less pinacidil was metabolized to the N-oxide metabolite in the patients with cirrhosis than in the normal individuals. Thus pinacidil's metabolism and clearance are reduced in patients with cirrhosis but are independent of debrisoquin phenotype. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data that summarizes the study findings, including the mean elimination half-life (6.1 +/- 0.6 hours), the clearance rate of pinacidil in cirrhotic patients (20.7 +/- 1.4 L/hr), and the clearance rate in healthy subjects (42.1 +/- 5.1 L/hr).

A proposed means of harm reduction is to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day. However, it is not clear whether this strategy decreases the risk for tobacco-related diseases.   \\n OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of smoking reduction on lung cancer incidence.   \\n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational population-based cohort study with up to 31 years of follow-up from the Copenhagen Centre for Prospective Population Studies, which administrates data from 3 longitudinal studies conducted in Copenhagen and suburbs, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, the Copenhagen Male Study, and the Glostrup Population Studies, Denmark. Participants were 11,151 men and 8563 women (N = 19,714) aged 20 to 93 years, who attended 2 consecutive examinations with a 5- to 10-year interval between 1964 and 1988. Participants underwent a physical examination and completed self-filled questionnaires about lifestyle habits. The study population was divided into 6 groups according to smoking habits: continued heavy smokers (> or =15 cigarettes/d), reducers (reduced from > or =15 cigarettes/d by minimum of 50% without quitting), continued light smokers (1-14 cigarettes/d), quitters (stopped between first and second examination), stable ex-smokers, and never smokers.   \\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incident primary lung cancer cases assessed by record linkage with the National Cancer Registry until December 31, 2003.   \\n RESULTS There were 864 incident lung cancers during follow-up. Using Cox regression, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for lung cancer in reducers was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.98) compared with persistent heavy smokers. The HR for light smokers was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.35-0.56); for quitters, HR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.36-0.69), for stable ex-smokers, HR 0.17 (95% CI, 0.13-0.23), and for never smokers, HR 0.09 (95% CI, 0.06-0.13).   \\n CONCLUSION Among individuals who smoke 15 or more cigarettes per day, smoking reduction by 50% significantly reduces the risk of lung cancer.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract follows a structured format: it contains a topic sentence that states the objective of the study (\\"OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of smoking reduction on lung cancer incidence.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it.

The ratio of maximum power to minimum power in the wave can be measured and is called the standing wave ratio (SWR). A SWR of 1:1 is ideal. A SWR of 1.5:1 is considered to be marginally acceptable in low power applications where power loss is more critical, although an SWR as high as 6:1 may still be usable with the right equipment.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf.

In 1661, soon after the coronation, he painted a formalised portrait of the monarch, seated in front of a tapestry representing the Judgement of Solomon, wearing St. Edward's Crown, the robes of the Garter, and carrying the orb and sceptre. Wright was also commissioned to paint an allegorical ceiling for the King's bedchamber at Whitehall Palace, and he was further appointed in 1673 to the office of \\"picture drawer in ordinary\\", allowing him to exercise his right to sign his pictures \\"Pictor Regis\\". However, to his disappointment, he did not receive the coveted office of King's Painter, which was held in the 1660s by Sir Peter Lely alone. In contrast to Wright's sympathetic realism, and carefully observed landscape backgrounds, Lely had a more glamorous style, favoured by the court, and based on Van Dyck's pre-Civil War style. This prompted the diarist Samuel Pepys to remark, after an enjoyable visit to Lely's studio, \\"thence to Wright's the painters: but Lord, the difference that is between their two works\\".Unlike Lely, who was knighted, Wright never received significant recognition from King Charles. However, at least one admirer thought he did deserve it. In 1669, Wright and the miniaturist Samuel Cooper had met Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

But that idea is becoming increasingly out of date. As planned, computerized tests will begin next year which will bring a series of changes from test psychology to scoring techniques.\\nFrom computer - equipped rooms, examinees will answer the questions on a computer. If they are sure about their choices, they can pass to the next question by pressing the entry  \\"next\\". Then another question will be randomly selected from a vast test item bank and appear on the screen. After answering all the questions, examinees can choose the entry \\"quit\\" if they are not satisfied with their performance, or \\"score\\" if they want to see the result. Scores will be calculated immediately and appear on the screen. By that point, student's marks are official--there is no going back.\\nSince they greatly shorten the painful waiting process-which used to be two or three months, computerized tests have won worldwide popularity. Besides, there will be no rushing to the registration offices( )for these exams. Computerized tests will be given every workday in an exam center with all three kinds of tests being held in the same room. All test takers need to do is to call the exam center and book their seats for a particular day.\\nIn addition it will become technically possible to apply new testing procedures. In the past,each examinee had the same set of test items despite differences in their ability.

In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant.

When young children are about one year old, they start to yawn when they see others yawning. That's why scientists seem to think yawning is contagious.\\nIt's no secret that yawning is contagious, but why do we yawn? Well, scientists are not really sure.\\nSome think we yawn because we feel bored. Recently scientists studied two groups of students between the ages of 17 and 19. One group watched music videos, and the other watched a boring color test. Scientists compared the numbers of their yawns and found that the color test group yawned more times than the video group.\\nAnother reason for yawning has to do with breathing. Some scientists believe that when we are bored or tired, we breathe more slowly. As our breathing slows down, we cannot get rid of  enough carbon dioxide, our bodies will tell the brains to breathe deeply. The result is a big yawn.\\nIn 2007, scientists suggested a new reason. They said that the reason why people yawned was to cool down their brains. These scientists found that people who were warmer than others yawned more often.\\nScientists are still trying to find out why yawning happens and why it is so contagious. But they are only sure that when one person yawns, almost everyone else nearby wants to yawn, too.\\nQuestion: According to the scientists, people start to yawn when they are   _  .\\nAnswer:","target":"inside their mothers","rationale":"The article says that scientists have found babies start to yawn before they are born.

Science cannot explain the first time a baby does this (or why), but we know it happens most often for babies between 8 weeks and 5 months after birth –  which is just around the same time as social smiles appear.

Mayfield's father left the family when Curtis was five; his mother (and maternal grandmother) moved the family into several Chicago public housing projects before settling in Cabrini-Green during his teen years. Mayfield attended Wells Community Academy High School before dropping out his sophomore year. His mother taught him piano and, along with his grandmother, encouraged him to enjoy gospel music.\\n\\nMayfield's career began in 1956 when he joined the Roosters with Arthur and Richard Brooks and Jerry Butler. Two years later the Roosters, now including Sam Gooden, became the Impressions. The band had two hit singles with Butler, \\"For Your Precious Love\\" and \\"Come Back My Love\\", then Butler left. Mayfield temporarily went with him, co-writing and performing on Butler's next hit, \\"He Will Break Your Heart\\", before returning to the Impressions with the group signing for ABC Records and working with the label's Chicago-based producer/A&R manager, Johnny Pate.  Butler was replaced by Fred Cash, a returning original Roosters member, and Mayfield became lead singer, frequently composing for the band, starting with \\"Gypsy Woman\\", a Top 20 Pop hit. Their hit \\"Amen\\" (Top 10), an updated version of an old gospel tune, was included in the soundtrack of the 1963 United Artists film Lilies of the Field, which starred Sidney Poitier. The Impressions reached the height of their popularity in the mid-to-late-'60s with a string of Mayfield compositions that included \\"Keep On Pushing,\\" \\"People Get Ready\\", \\"It's All Right\\" (Top 10), the up-tempo \\"Talking about My Baby\\"(Top 20) and \\"Woman's Got Soul\\".  He formed his own label, Curtom Records in Chicago in 1968 and the Impressions joined him to continue their run of hits including \\"Fool For You,\\" \\"This is My Country\\", \\"Choice Of Colors\\" and \\"Check Out Your Mind.\\" Mayfield had written much of the soundtrack of the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s, but by the end of the decade, he was a pioneering voice in the black pride movement along with James Brown and Sly Stone. Mayfield's \\"We're a Winner\\" was their last major hit for ABC. A Number 1 soul hit which also reached the Billboard pop Top 20, it became an anthem of the black power and black pride movements when it was released in late 1967, much as his earlier \\"Keep on Pushing\\" (whose title is quoted in the lyrics of \\"We're a Winner\\" and also in \\"Move On Up\\") had been an anthem for Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement.  Mayfield was a prolific songwriter in Chicago even outside his work for the Impressions, writing and producing scores of hits for many other artists. He also owned the Mayfield and Windy C labels which were distributed by Cameo-Parkway, and was a partner in the Curtom (first independent, then distributed by Buddah then Warner Bros and finally RSO) and Thomas labels (first independent, then distributed by Atlantic, then independent again and finally Buddah).  Among Mayfield's greatest songwriting successes were three hits that he wrote for Jerry Butler on Vee Jay (\\"He Will Break Your Heart\\", \\"Find Another Girl\\" and \\"I'm A-Tellin' You\\"). His harmony vocals are very prominent. He also had great success writing and arranging Jan Bradley's \\"Mama Didn't Lie\\".

Farah was advised by Malaika Arora to cast Padukone as the female lead, who was suggested by Wendell Roddick, under whom Padukone was working. She was cast without a screen test. Khan felt that she was \\"a beautiful, classic Indian beauty\\" who fit the role of an actor of the 1970s. She was excited at the prospect of working with Shah Rukh and said, \\"I've grown up watching [Shah Rukh] and always admired him so much. To get to work with him ... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him.\\"  In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language. Her character was modelled after Malini and nicknamed Dreamy Girl after her the latter's nickname as Dream Girl. Rampal was approached by both Khan amd Shah Rukh at the latter's New Years Eve party. Rampal was initially reluctant to do the role as he felt it was \\"too evil\\" for someone like him. With persuasion from Shah Rukh, he agreed. Rampal wore a mustache in the film which was suggested by Shah Rukh. Shreyas Talpade played a supporting role as the best friend of Khan's character.

Other Cubists, by contrast, especially František Kupka, and those considered Orphists by Apollinaire (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs and Amorpha chromatique chaude, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled Simultaneous Windows, followed by a series entitled Formes Circulaires, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled Contrasts of Forms, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in Les Peintres cubistes (1913), writing of a new \\"pure\\" painting in which the subject was vacated. But in spite of his use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.","target":"Contrasts of Forms","rationale":"The question asks which painting was painted later, Amorpha-Fugue a deux couleurs or Contrasts of Forms.\\nAccording to the context, Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational).

Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death.\\n\\nTitle:","target":"Predation","rationale":"In the article, Predation is defined as an act of killing and eating another living thing. \\nThe title \\"Predation\\" fits well with this definition."},{"source":"See the conversation.

Built in 1986 by former funny car driver Billy Meyer, the Motorplex was the first National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) \\"super track.\\" It annually hosts the AAA Texas NHRA FallNationals each October, when hundreds of professional and amateur drag racers compete for over $2 million in prize money. Past winners have included John Force, Kenny Bernstein, and Tony Schumacher. Perhaps the one identifying feature of the track, is that from the burnout pad, to the shutdown area, it is the only all concrete strip within the NHRA's schedule of events.\\n\\n- Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.\\n\\n- In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.\\n\\n- Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties. The region is traditionally described as eight counties, based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, which includes Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions. Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States.\\n\\n- Ennis is a city in Ellis County, Texas, United States, located south of Dallas. The population was 18,513 at the 2010 census, up from 16,454 at the 2000 census. The city is notable for its historic Czech heritage, with several community halls dedicated to different fraternities and organizations celebrating Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak heritage. It is also home to the Bluebonnet Festival, the National Polka Festival, and several National Hot Rod Association drag races at the Texas Motorplex, most notably the AAA Texas NHRA FallNationals.\\n\\n- The Texas State Capitol, completed in 1888 in Downtown Austin, contains the offices and chambers of the Texas Legislature and the Office of the Governor. Designed in 1881 by architect Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed from 1882 to 1888 under the direction of civil engineer Reuben Lindsay Walker. A $75 million underground extension was completed in 1993. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1986. The Texas State Capitol is tall, making it the sixth tallest state capitol and one of several taller than the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.\\n\\n- A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.\\n\\n- San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States.

The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,300,092 as of July 1, 2015.\\n\\n- Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence.

He graduated with a B.S. and M.A. in Physics and did extensive theoretical and experimental research on the Mössbauer effect . He died in San Diego on February 4 , 2010 after a period of illness . Holliday became one of the first 100 employees of Tracor in 1962 and quickly became Director of Analysis and Applied Research in the Electronic Systems Division . In 1965 Holliday left Austin to develop the Tracor facility in San Diego and began his doctorate in applied physics at the University of California , San Diego . In San Diego Holliday began his study in acoustics for which he is known . His study of transient flow in natural gas pipelines led to the publication of a textbook which is still used as a standard reference . In the 1970s Holliday began testing a revolutionary technique for the detection and size measurement of zooplankton in thin layers involving multi-frequency backscattering . The technique developed and after twenty years became the established framework for research in the field . In the early 1980s Holliday built the first prototype of the Tracor Acoustical Profiling System ( TAPS ) which has been described as decades ahead of its time by the Acoustical Society of America . TAPS is now the standard instrument for acoustical profiling of plankton in the sea . Holliday published hundreds of papers on underwater acoustics and acoustical oceanography and given dozens of talks and symposia in several countries . In 2004 Holliday became only the third recipient of the Acoustical Society of America Silver Medal in Acoustical Oceanography , for \`\` contributions to the study of marine life , from plankton to whales '' . Holliday was awarded the Prix d'Excellence by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ( ICES ) in recognition of extraordinary contributions , fulfilling the ICES vision of scientific discovery , leadership , and applications that...\\n\\n- In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest).\\n\\n- The Mössbauer effect, or recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence, is a physical phenomenon discovered by Rudolf Mössbauer in 1958.

Founded in 1914 by major leaders of the Progressive Movement, it attempted to find a balance between a progressivism focused on humanitarianism and moral passion, and on the other hand sought a basis in scientific analysis of social issues. It supported American entry into World War One, but discarded much of its faith in the possibility of a scientific liberalism. After the 1980s it incorporated elements of conservatism. In 2014, two years after Chris Hughes purchased the magazine, he ousted its editor and attempted to remake its format and operations, provoking the resignation of the majority of its editors and writers. In early 2016, Hughes announced he was putting the magazine up for sale, indicating the need for \\"new vision and leadership\\". It was sold in February 2016 to Win McCormack.\\n\\n- A computer network or data network is a telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.

In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language (known as \\"wiki markup\\") and often edited with the help of a rich-text editor. A wiki is run using wiki software, otherwise known as a wiki engine. There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may also be imposed to organize content. A wiki engine is a type of content management system, but it differs from most other such systems, including blog software, in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.\\n\\n- An animated sitcom is a subgenre of the sitcom that is animated rather than live action.\\n\\n- A television antenna, or TV aerial, is an antenna specifically designed for the reception of over-the-air broadcast television signals, which are transmitted at frequencies from about 41 to 250 MHz in the VHF band, and 470 to 960 MHz in the UHF band in different countries. Television antennas are manufactured in two different types: \\"indoor\\" antennas, to be located on top of or next to the television set, and \\"outdoor\\" antennas, mounted on a mast on top of the owner's house. Outdoor antennas are more expensive and difficult to install, but are necessary for adequate reception in fringe areas far from television stations. The most common types of indoor antennas are the dipole (\\"rabbit ears\\") and loop antennas, and for outdoor antennas the yagi, log periodic, and for UHF channels the multi-bay reflective array antenna.\\n\\n- Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or, in the 2010s, light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.\\nAnalog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation.\\n\\n- Stanley \\"Stan\\" Marsh is a main character in the animated television series \\"South Park\\". He is voiced by and loosely based on series co-creator Trey Parker. Stan is one of the show's four central characters, along with his friends Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick and Eric Cartman.

The technology was originally developed by General Instrument before being acquired by Motorola and subsequently acquired by ARRIS Group. Cable companies converted to digital systems during the 2000s, around the time that television signals were converted to the digital HDTV format, which was not compatible with earlier analog cable systems. In addition to providing higher resolution HD video, digital cable systems provide expanded services such as pay-per-view programming, cable internet access and cable telephone services. Most digital cable signals are encrypted, which reduced the high incidence of cable theft which occurred in analog systems. \\n\\n- Analog television (or analogue television) is the original television technology that uses analog signals to transmit video and audio. In an analog television broadcast, the brightness, colors and sound are represented by rapid variations of either the amplitude, frequency or phase of the signal.\\n\\n- The Daily Beast is an American left leaning news reporting and opinion website, with rarely conservative views, although many argue that the news site is middle of the road. The website focuses on politics and pop culture. In a 2015 interview, Editor-in-Chief John Avlon described \\"The Beast\\"'s editorial approach: \\"We seek out scoops, scandals and stories about secret worlds; we love confronting bullies, bigots and hypocrites\\".\\n\\n- Randolph Severn \\"Trey\\" Parker III (born October 19, 1969) is an American actor, animator, writer, director, producer, singer, and songwriter.

Anderson . It explores the idea that the traditional mass media in the United States are biased towards liberals , but through new media , such as the Internet , cable television , and talk radio , conservatives are slowly gaining some power in the world of information . The name South Park Conservatives derives from Andrew Sullivan 's term , \`\` South Park Republican '' .\\n\\n- Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.\\n\\n- Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. \\n\\n- Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to\\nelectrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (see mechanical filter and RF MEMS).\\n\\n- Eric Theodore Cartman is one of the main characters in the animated television series \\"South Park\\", created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and voiced by Trey Parker. Cartman, generally referred to by his surname, is one of four central characters in \\"South Park\\", along with his friends Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick. Cartman first appeared, originally named Kenny, in prototypical form in a 1992 animated short \\"Jesus vs. Frosty\\", and a 1995 animated short \\"Jesus vs. Santa\\", and first appeared on television in the pilot episode of \\"South Park\\", \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\", on August 13, 1997.\\n\\n- Andrew Michael Sullivan (born 10 August 1963) is an English-born American author, editor, and blogger. Sullivan is a conservative political commentator, a former editor of \\"The New Republic\\", and the author or editor of six books. He was a pioneer of the political blog, starting his in 2000. He eventually moved his blog to various publishing platforms, including \\"Time\\", \\"The Atlantic\\", \\"The Daily Beast\\", and finally an independent subscription-based format. He announced his retirement from blogging in 2015.\\n\\n- Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced ), is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket. The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable was invented by English engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880.\\nCoaxial cable differs from other shielded cable used for carrying lower-frequency signals, in that the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.\\n\\n- Mass communication is the study of how people and entities relay information through mass media to large segments of the population at the same time. In other words, mass communication refers to the imparting and exchanging of information on a large scale to a wide range of people. It is usually understood to relate newspaper, magazine, and book publishing, as well as radio, television and film, even via internet as these mediums are used for disseminating information, news and advertising. Mass communication differs from the studies of other forms of communication, such as interpersonal communication or organizational communication, in that it focuses on a single source transmitting information to a large number of receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the behavior, attitude, opinion, or emotion of the person or people receiving the information.\\n\\n- A blog (a truncation of the expression weblog) is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (\\"posts\\"). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, \\"multi-author blogs\\" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other \\"microblogging\\" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. \\"Blog\\" can also be used as a verb, meaning \\"to maintain or add content to a blog\\".\\n\\n- Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text which the reader can immediately access, or where text can be revealed progressively at multiple levels of detail (also called StretchText). Hyper<wbr>text documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress sequence or by touching the screen. Apart from text, the term \\"hyper<wbr>text\\" is also sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational content forms with integrated hyperlinks. Hyper<wbr>text is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web, where Web pages are often written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication of information over the Internet.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'south park conservatives' has the relation 'genre' with?","target":"politics","rationale":"The best answer is politics."},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: Most of New Jersey gets more snow, which is a type of?\\nContext: Annual precipitation is 40 inches (1,020 mm) which is fairly spread throughout the year.

Scotland's economy was relatively small, its range of exports very limited and it was in a weak position in relation to England, its powerful neighbour . In an era of economic rivalry in Europe, Scotland was incapable of protecting itself from the effects of English competition and legislation. The kingdom had no reciprocal export trade and its once thriving industries such as shipbuilding were in deep decline; goods that were in demand had to be bought from England for sterling. Moreover, the Navigation Acts further increased economic dependence on England by limiting Scotland's shipping, and the Royal Scots Navy was relatively small. A series of domestic conflicts, including the 1639-51 Wars of the Three Kingdoms and unrest related to religious differences between 1670-1690 exhausted the people and diminished their resources. The so-called \\"seven ill years\\" of the 1690s saw widespread crop failures and famine, while Scotland's deteriorating economic position led to calls for a political or customs union with England. However, the stronger feeling among Scots was that the country should become a great mercantile and colonial power like England. In response a number of solutions were enacted by the Parliament of Scotland: in 1695the Bank of Scotland was established; the Act for the Settling of Schools created a parish-based system of public education throughout Scotland; and the Company of Scotland was chartered with capital to be raised by public subscription to trade with \\"Africa and the Indies\\".\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"What happened first, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms or the establishment of the Bank of Scotland?","rationale":"Here's a question for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: What happened first, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms or the establishment of the Bank of Scotland?"},{"source":"The sidewalk next to a house having a crack in it and having vegetation growing from it is considered?\\n- insects\\n- weathering\\n- erosion\\n- lava","target":"weathering","rationale":"Weathering is the process by which large rocks are broken down into smaller pieces.

Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons.\\nTwelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king for pardoning her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to \\"free\\" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer. Brother Gilbert (Pete Postlethwaite), a monk and aspiring poet, observes Bowen slaying a dragon and follows him to record his exploits. Bowen stalks another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) to its cave, however the confrontation ends in a stalemate. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings.

Most of the conventional SSL methods assume that the classes of unlabeled data are included in the set of classes of labeled data. In addition, these methods do not sort out useless unlabeled samples and use all the unlabeled data for learning, which is not suitable for realistic situations. In this paper, we propose an SSL method called selective self-training (SST), which selectively decides whether to include each unlabeled sample in the training process. It is also designed to be applied to a more real situation where classes of unlabeled data are different from the ones of the labeled data. For the conventional SSL problems which deal with data where both the labeled and unlabeled samples share the same class categories, the proposed method not only performs comparable to other conventional SSL algorithms but also can be combined with other SSL algorithms. While the conventional methods cannot be applied to the new SSL problems where the separated data do not share the classes, our method does not show any performance degradation even if the classes of unlabeled data are different from those of the labeled data.","target":"Our proposed algorithm does not use all of the unlabeled data for the training, and it rather uses them selectively","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nOur proposed algorithm does not use all of the unlabeled data for the training, and it rather uses them selectively."},{"source":"During Victoria's first pregnancy in 1840, in the first few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother.

Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived.\\nGreg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost.\\nGreg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance.\\nGreg gladly paid $4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.\\nHis little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.\\nHow long did it probably take to get from the church to Greg's studio?\\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\\n\\nA.

The text mentions that Greg was released from jury duty in the morning, which means there would not have been enough time for him to spend days or hours driving home. Therefore, option A & C are ruled out as possible answers.

Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit Willamette Riverkeeper organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the National Park Service added the Willamette water trail—expanded to 217 miles (349 km) to include some of the major tributaries—to its list of national water trails.

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of.\\nWhile in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community.\\nIn my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.\\nThe young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn.

He noticed that elands, which is a prey animal, are basically nocturnal. On the other hand, wild boars, another prey animal, are not nocturnal.\\n\\nWhich species would be more active at night, elands or wild boars?\\n\\nHint: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.","target":"elands","rationale":"Elands and wild boars live in the African Savannah.

Kid A divided listeners but was named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and The Times.\\nHail to the Thief (2003) mixed rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling.

The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron.

He was the second of three sons born to the couple; his brothers were Joris and Vicky. The family lived on Talang Street near Menteng, Central Jakarta, until 1954, when they moved to Pegangsaan Street (also in Menteng). While attending GIKI Elementary School, Chrisye befriended the neighbouring Nasution family; he became especially close to Bamid Gauri, with whom he played badminton and flew kites.\\nContext: Chrisye's tenor voice and performance on Badai Pasti Berlalu led Amin Widjaja of Musica Studios to ask him to sign with Musica; Widjaja had been scouting him since the release of Guruh Gipsy. Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom, to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed. In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica, Sabda Alam (Nature's Order), incorporating several songs by other artists and some written by himself, including the title song. He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger; despite Amin's wanting to monitor their progress, Chrisye refused to allow him access. The album, greatly influenced by Badai Pasti Berlalu and drawing on the double tracking technique pioneered by the Beatles (in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound), was released in August that year. Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies.  The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May.  After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, Puspa Indah (Beautiful Flower). All but one of the songs were composed by Guruh Sukarnoputra; the album also featured the English-language \\"To My Friends on Legian Beach\\". Two of the songs, \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" (\\"Galih and Ratna\\") and \\"Gita Cinta\\" (\\"Love Song\\"), were used in the 1979 film Gita Cinta dari SMA (Love Song from High School); Chrisye played a minor part in the film's sequel, Puspa Indah Taman Hati (Beautiful Flower in the Heart's Garden), as a singer. Due in part to the popularity of the film, Puspa Indah was well received and sold well; \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" and \\"Gita Cinta\\", released as singles, were also commercially successful.  In 1980 Chrisye appeared in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan (As Beautiful as the Moon); at first reluctant to accept the role, he was convinced by Sys NS that it would be fun. He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical.\\nQuestion: did this album do well ?.

He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001.\\nContext: Herbert Alexander Simon was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 15, 1916. His father, Arthur Simon (1881-1948), was an electrical engineer who had come to the United States from Germany in 1903 after earning his engineering degree from the Technische Hochschule of Darmstadt. An inventor who was granted \\"several dozen patents\\", his father also was an independent patent attorney. His mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel, was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors had come from Prague and Cologne. His European ancestors had been piano makers, goldsmiths, and vintners. Simon's father was Jewish and his mother came from a family with Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic backgrounds. Simon called himself an atheist.  Simon was educated in the Milwaukee public school system, where he developed an interest in science. He found schoolwork to be interesting and easy. Unlike many children, Simon was exposed to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically at a relatively young age due to the influence of his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel, who had studied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under John R. Commons. Through his uncle's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered the social sciences. Among his earliest influences, Simon has cited Richard Ely's economics textbook, Norman Angell's The Great Illusion, and Henry George's Progress and Poverty. At that time, Simon argued \\"from conviction, rather than cussedness\\" in favor of George's controversial \\"single tax\\" on land rents.  In 1933, Simon entered the University of Chicago, and following those early influences, he studied the social sciences and mathematics.

His most important mentor was Henry Schultz, an econometrician and mathematical economist.

Denver's Manning threw a scoring pass to Demaryius Thomas at the end of the third quarter for their only touchdown of the game. The Chargers pulled to within six points at 16-10 after a TD catch by Gates with 10 minutes left. The Chargers trailed only 9-3 at the half after holding the Broncos to a field goal each time they entered the red zone.

You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.

Sweeney rejected Rebay's dismissal of \\"objective\\" painting and sculpture, and he soon acquired Constantin Brâncuși's Adam and Eve (1921), followed by works of other modernist sculptors, including Joseph Csaky, Jean Arp, Calder, Alberto Giacometti and David Smith. Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire Paul Cézanne's Man with Crossed Arms (c. 1899). The same year, the foundation also received a gift of 28 important works from the Estate of Katherine S. Dreier, a founder of America's first collection to be called a modern art museum, the Société Anonyme. Dreier had been a colleague of Rebay's. The works included Little French Girl (1914–18) by Brâncuși, an untitled still life (1916) by Juan Gris, a bronze sculpture (1919) by Alexander Archipenko and three collages (1919–21) by German Hanoverian Dadaist Schwitters.

Now they've found that the ability to prevent muscle breakdown is reduced with age.\\nWhen older people eat, they don't build enough muscle with the protein in food; also, the insulin   fails to shut down the muscle breakdown that rises between meals and overnight. Normally, in young people, insulin acts to slow muscle breakdown.\\nThe research just published compared one group of people in their late 60s to a group of 25-year-olds, with equal numbers of men and women. \\"We studied our subjects first -- before breakfast -- and then after giving them a small amount of insulin to raise the hormone  to what they would be if they had eaten breakfast,\\" Professor Rennie said.\\n\\" The results were clear.

Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers, there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids, and Native American tales strengthened their credibility. In 1869, one-armed Civil War veteran John Wesley Powell led an expedition from Green River Station in Wyoming, aiming to run the two rivers all the way down to St. Thomas, Nevada, near present-day Hoover Dam. Powell and nine men – none of whom had prior whitewater experience – set out in May. After braving the rapids of the Gates of Lodore, Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado, the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River, where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words ever written about the Grand Canyon of the Colorado:\\nWe are now ready to start on our way down the Great Unknown.

After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd.

Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display.

Sentence 2: So she decided to go there and buy bread. Sentence 3: But when she tried it, it was tough and stale. Sentence 4: And remembering the of the high cost of it made her disappointed. Choices: a. She had to put the dog in the kennel from now on. b. Sarah ended up using it for French toast.","target":"b","rationale":"The premise of the story is that Sarah buys stale bread from a new organic bakery, which upsets her because of the cost. To continue this story with sentence b, we can infer that Sarah's disappointment turns into frustration as she has to figure out how to use the stale bread in a way that doesn't go to waste."},{"source":"Compose a new way to ask the same question. The new question must be asking the exact same thing as the original question does. Without any other information, you should be able to tell that the original question and the new question are the same. Preserve bracketed phrases in your new question. You can change the rest of the question provided the above requirements are satisfied. The new question must have a natural, fluent formulation, as if it were composed by a native English speaker. You will be given three pieces of information to help you create better questions. Those are: \\"Answer\\": the answer to the question, e.g., \\"Honolulu\\". \\"Answer Type\\": the type of the answer, e.g., \\"Location\\". \\"Auxiliary Information\\" is a detailed description of some concepts mentioned in the question, if any.\\n\\noriginal question: Which celestial object is in category of [Natural satellite]?\\nanswer: remus, s/2003 j 16, prospero...\\nanswer type: Celestial Object.\\nauxiliary information: A natural satellite or moon is a celestial body that orbits another body, which is called its primary, and that is not artificial. In the Solar System there are 173 known natural satellites orbiting within 6 planetary satellite systems. In addition, several other planetary-mass objects are known to have satellite systems, including those of the IAU-listed dwarf planets, the moons of Pluto, Haumea and the Eris‚ÄìDysnomia systems. As of January 2012, over 200 minor-planet moons have been discovered. There are 76 known objects in the asteroid belt with satellites, four Jupiter trojans, 39 near-Earth objects, and 14 Mars-crossers. There are also 84 known natural satellites of trans-Neptunian objects. Some 150 additional small bodies have been observed within the rings of Saturn, but only a few were tracked long enough to establish orbits. Planets around other stars are likely to have satellites as well, and although numerous candidates have been detected to date, none have yet been confirmed. Of the inner planets, Mercury and Venus have no natural satellites; Earth has one large natural satellite, known as the Moon; and Mars has two tiny natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.","target":"[Natural satellite] is the category of what celestial object?","rationale":"The answer to the original question is a list of ['remus', 's/2003 j 16', 'prospero...'], which are celestial objects.
