Houston answered back with a 29-yard field goal from Bullock with 2:31 left to trail 10-17. Dallas was penalized for a delay of game following a Houston timeout which lead to 4th down and 16. Following the penalty, the Texans got the ball back before tying the game with 0:41 left in regulation. Following a timeout called by both teams, Bailey's 53 yard field goal was no good, sending the game into overtime. Houston received the ball first, but was forced to punt the ball back from the Dallas 48. Dallas won the game following a Dan Bailey 49 yard field goal. In a historic game between the two Texas teams, both the Texans and Cowboys boasted a winning record (3-1) for the first time while meeting. With the win, Dallas leads the regular season series 3-1.

Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he submitted a number of paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected outright or drew little attention when exhibited. In 1821 he finally achieved recognition when the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of his works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, beating John Constable to the position.Following the success of Cleopatra, over the next decade, Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in nude studies, and although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.","target":"The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia","rationale":"The full name of the successful painting that Etty tried to replicate by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings is The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia."},{"source":"Premise: Then the Home Office might have ordered exhumation. \\nHypothesis: They would have exhumed it to see if he became a vampire. \\nIs the hypothesis entailed by the premise?\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no And the answer is:","target":"it is not possible to tell","rationale":"The premise doesn't explicitly mention whether or not the Home Office would have exhumed to check if he became a vampire.

Her father, Berndt Wackels Danielsen (1836-1910), was Norwegian but had German citizenship. He was a ship's captain in the merchant marine, and a Protestant traditionalist (his children nicknamed him \\"the Bible-thrower\\", as he did indeed throw Bibles). Her mother, Clotilde, nee van Ronzelen (1853-1911), known as \\"Sonni\\", was also Protestant, of Dutch origin.\\n\\nHorney was also a pioneer in the discipline of feminine psychiatry. As one of the first female psychiatrists, she was the first known woman to present a paper regarding feminine psychiatry. The fourteen papers she wrote between 1922 and 1937 were amalgamated into a single volume titled Feminine Psychology. As a woman, she felt that the mapping out of trends in female behaviour was a neglected issue. In her essay entitled \\"The Problem of Feminine Masochism\\", Horney felt she proved that cultures and societies worldwide encouraged women to be dependent on men for their love, prestige, wealth, care and protection. She pointed out that in the society, a will to please, satiate and overvalue men had emerged. Women were regarded as objects of charm and beauty--at variance with every human being's ultimate purpose of self-actualization.  Women, according to Horney, traditionally gain value only through their children and the wider family. She touched further on this subject in her essay \\"The Distrust Between the Sexes\\" in which she compared the husband-wife relationship to a parent-child relationship--one of misunderstanding and one which breeds detrimental neuroses. Most notably, her work \\"The Problem of the Monogamous Ideal\\" was fixed upon marriage, as were six other of Horney's papers. Her essay \\"Maternal Conflicts\\" attempted to shed new light on the problems women experience when raising adolescents.  Horney believed that both men and women have a drive to be ingenious and productive. Women are able to satisfy this need normally and internally--to do this they become pregnant and give birth. Men please this need only through external ways; Horney proposed that the striking accomplishments of men in work or some other field can be viewed as compensation for their inability to give birth to children.  Horney developed her ideas to the extent that she released one of the first \\"self-help\\" books in 1946, entitled Are You Considering Psychoanalysis?. The book asserted that those, both male and female, with relatively minor neurotic problems could, in effect, be their own psychiatrists.

Charles was defeated at the Battle of Aybar in 1452, captured, and released; and John tried to disinherit him by illegally naming his daughter Eleanor, who was married to Gaston IV of Foix, his successor. In 1451, John's new wife, Juana Enríquez, gave birth to a son, Ferdinand. In 1452, Charles fled his father first to France, where vainly sought allies, and later to the court of his uncle, John's elder brother, Alfonso V at Naples. Charles was popular in Spain and John was increasingly unpopular as he refused to recognise Charles as his \\"first born\\", probably planning to make Ferdinand his heir. The Navarrese Civil War presaged the Catalan Civil War of 1462-72, in which John's ill-treatment of Charles was a precipitating event.\\n\\nQuestion: Who did John II marry first, Juana Enriquez or Blanche I of Navarre?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Blanche I of Navarre","rationale":"Here is a question for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Who did John II marry first, Juana Enriquez or Blanche I of Navarre?"},{"source":"You are given a sentence from a conversation between a human and a virtual assistant.

The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be un-original, hence establishing a \\"critical text\\", or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition.

NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\".

ACE2mediated catabolism of angiotensin II is likely to have a major role in cardiovascular protection, whereas the relevant functions and signalling mechanisms of actions induced by angiotensin 1-7 have not been conclusively determined.

He wrote scores mostly for television series up until 1995, in which he wrote a few of the cues for the animated Disney motion picture A Goofy Movie. He continued to score television series until the two then young directors, the Wachowskis, hired him to score their neo-noir film Bound. It was reasonably successful at the box office. Bound was the film which led Davis into becoming the composer for the entire Matrix trilogy. Subsequently, Davis has composed scores for films such as Jurassic Park III (recommended to the filmmakers by John Williams, the composer of the scores for the first two films in the series), House on Haunted Hill, Behind Enemy Lines, and The Unsaid. In 2004, he produced the music score for the BBC science fiction documentary series Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets, released as Voyage to the Planets and Beyond in the United States.\\n Passage 2:Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that \\"the musical scenes are the best rock coverage since 'Woodstock.'

It is uncluttered, one of the best concert films so far.\\" A review in Variety said, \\"Considerable technical expertise has gone into this production, and though the objective may be clear, it just hasn't turned out to be another 'Woodstock,' possibly because Joe Cocker's personality isn't all that endearing.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune rated the film three stars out of four and wrote, \\"'Mad Dogs' is distinguishable from other 'rockumentaries' because it deals almost exclusively with the musician and his music. There are few side trips to cultural comments.\\" Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times stated, \\"As a film, 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen' is a good concert. For much of the picture's 114 minutes, the camera is on Joe Cocker, by most standards the best and most exciting singer in rock music ... But 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen,' unfortunately, fails in the end to rise above this interesting, but clearly limited historical summary of the Cocker tour. As a film, it doesn't establish its own importance.\\" A negative review by Tom Zito of The Washington Post advised readers to \\"Forget the film and try the record,\\" explaining, \\"What emerges from all this is roughly two hours of footage that looks terrible on the screen and sounds almost as bad. The film is projected in an annoying square format, except for the moments when the screen area is broken up into some poorly coordinated split-screen effects. The camerawork is often sloppy ... the whole thing winds up looking and sounding like a cheap, imitation (indoor) 'Woodstock.'\\" James D. White of The Monthly Film Bulletin declared that \\"The music itself is excellent,\\" but \\"The film's information content is minimal; and one's heart sinks as the screen is split into a double image for the first number and as the mandatory shots—of excited fans, of joint-rolling in a hotel bedroom, of an interview with a vacuous groupie—are inevitably wheeled out.\\"\\n Passage 3:The King's Royal Rifle Corps was an infantry rifle regiment of the British Army that was originally raised in British North America as the Royal American Regiment during the phase of the Seven Years' War in North America known as 'The French and Indian War.'

The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.","target":"Lancelot-Grail Cycle","rationale":"The article discusses the evolution of Arthurian legend, including the role played by a character known as Lancelot. According to this source, \\"continetal\\" (continental) Romances were written in poetry up until 1210; after that point they began to be written in prose. The Lancelot-Grail Cycle is described as one of these continental Romance works and it's characterized by its focus on reducing the importance of Arthur as a character. It also says that this cycle was followed closely by another series called Post-Vulgate Cycle which had similar features but also reduced the significance of characters like Guinevere(Arthur's wife).\\nBased on all this information we can conclude that: \\n\\n   1 - In Continental romance stories about King Arthur there were two cycles where his role"},{"source":"Read the following article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: The students were having their Chemistry class.

Based off the title it probably seems obvious, but like always the back story can change it up. (I broke a rule so I fixed it and am reposting) \\n\\nMy aunt breeds Australian Shepherds. She's a responsible breeder that only does one litter a year, is very careful about lineage and breeding for health along with the typical pure bred traits. She does it as a side business and it helps pay for stuff around the farm and house that they wouldn't be able to afford to get fixed otherwise. She's also just an amazing hardworking woman. When I was nine/ten, she gave me (not sure if my parents paid or not- never asked) my first dog, who was my rock through various issues that come with a rough childhood. I was a kid and made mistakes, but I truly loved this dog and cared for her as best I could. She had to be put down about a year ago now due to age related health issues, and lived to the ripe old age of fifteen.\\n\\nMy BF and I are getting ready to move into a townhouse, and we'll be looking for an ESA for me for anxiety and depression issues, and as such I'm trying to get a dog that's under a year to make it easier with training. Here's where the issue comes in. I desperately want an Aussie again. The place we're going to has the backyard opening up into a park, and I'm working to keep to a strict schedule that would work with the high energy of an Aussie. Part of me fully believes in the \\"adopt don't shop\\" mindset, but the other part of me wants an Aussie again. I had thought of adopting from an Australian Shepherd rescue, but now I can't imagine telling this woman that gave me my first dog that I chose to get my next one from somewhere else. And honestly, with her skill in picking personalities of even puppies, I feel like she would be best for getting me a good match.\\n\\nThe compromise I came to was that once we're settled in and I've been able to faithfully stick to a schedule that would suit a high energy dog, I would go with whatever came up first- either she had a spare puppy that didn't get bought or a rescue Aussie that matched my needs came up. But in the end, if the rescue comes up first, AITA for getting a rescue instead of asking to buy a puppy from my aunt? I know she would save me a puppy from the next litter if I asked.","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author is considering getting another dog and is torn between adopting a dog from a rescue or getting one from their aunt's breeder. The author's choice to adopt a dog from the rescue would be considered an ethical choice since it promotes responsible pet ownership and supports organizations that work to find homes for animals in need. In contrast, buying dogs from breeders can be problematic if it contributes to overpopulation of pets, poor care of puppies, and unethical breeding practices.\\n\\nThe author has already thought about what factors will impact their ability to care for the animal and is seeking out an option that will maximize the likelihood that they get a healthy pet. By choosing adoption over supporting breeders, the author will help reduce the demand for dogs bred in puppy mills and promote animal welfare in general.

Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Monsoon plays a big role in shaping local climates. In some places of the Horn of Africa monsoon causes heavy rainfall. But across the Red Sea the Arabian Peninsula mostly misses the monsoon.

It is commonly found in freshwater areas, and there are more than 400 species of \\"Spirogyra\\" in the world. \\"Spirogyra\\" measures approximately 10 to 100 m in width and may grow to several centimeters in length.\\n\\n- The Zygnematales ((zygos) + \\"\\" (nma) (nom.), \\"\\" (nmatos) (gen.)), also called the Conjugatales, are an order of green algae, comprising several thousand different species in two families. The larger family Zygnemataceae, with well-known genera such as \\"Zygnema\\" and \\"Spirogyra\\", includes members that grow as unbranched filaments, which grow longer through normal cell division. The smaller family Mesotaeniaceae includes the saccoderm \\"desmids\\", a group of unicellular species that were formerly classified with the \\"true\\" desmids. Most members of both families live in freshwater, and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants, rocks, and various debris.\\n\\n- In natural science, subaerial (literally \\"under the air\\"), first used in 1833, notably in geology and botany, to describe events or features that are formed, located or taking place immediately on or near the Earth's land surface. They are thus exposed to Earth's atmosphere. This may be contrasted with \\"subaqueous\\" events or features  located below a water surface, \\"submarine\\" events or features  located below a sea surface, or \\"subglacial\\" ones  located below glacial ice such as ice sheets.\\n\\n- Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.\\n\\n- The Zygnematacae are a family of filamentous or unicellular , uniseriate ( unbranched ) green algae . The filaments are septated and reproduction is by conjugation ; Spirogyra is commonly used in schools to demonstrate this kind of reproduction . The family is notable for its diversely shaped chloroplasts , such as stellate in Zygnema , helical in Spirogyra , and flat in Mougeotia . The Zygnemataceae are cosmopolitan , but though all generally occur in the same types of habitats , Mougeotia , Spirogyra , and Zygnema are by far the most common ; in one study across North America ( McCourt et al. , 1986 , as reported in Wehr , 2003 , pg. 363 ) , 95 % of the Zygnemataceae collected were in these three genera . Classification and identification is primarily by the morphology of the conjugation , which is somewhat rare to find in natural populations of permanent water bodies ; when in the vegetative state , the rarer genera resemble the three most common , and are often mistaken for them and catalogued as such . Conjugation can be induced in low - nitrogen culture . While they occupy many habitats , in North America all are found solely in freshwater or subaerial habitats . Species typically exist as floating mats in stagnant water in ditches and ponds , but some also grow in moving water , attaching themselves to a substrate by rhizoid - like projections of the basal cells of the filament . The mat species rise to the surface in early spring , grow rapidly through the summer , disappearing by late summer . Several genera appear to be endemic : Entransia is unique to Nova Scotia , and Pleurodiscus to Puerto Rico ; Mougeotiopsis is known only from Michigan , Wisconsin , North Carolina and British Columbia . Zygogonium and the unicellular Zygnemataceae prefer acidic water , and Ancylonema and one species of Mesotaenium grow on glacial ice . Members of the Zygnemataceae , such as Spirogyra , fall prey to parasites , especially chytrids .\\n\\n- Chloroplasts are organelles, specialized subunits, in plant and algal cells.

As a myotube is formed from many different myoblast cells, it contains many nuclei, but has a continuous cytoplasm. This is why skeletal muscle cells are multinucleate, as the nucleus of each contributing myoblast remains intact in the mature skeletal muscle cell. However, cardiac and smooth muscle cells are not multinucleate because the myoblasts that form their cells do not fuse. Gap junctions develop in the cardiac and single-unit smooth muscle in the early stages of development. In skeletal muscles, ACh receptors are initially present along most of the surface of the myoblasts, but spinal nerve innervation causes the release of growth factors that stimulate the formation of motor end-plates and NMJs. As neurons become active, electrical signals that are sent through the muscle influence the distribution of slow and fast fibers in the muscle. Although the number of muscle cells is set during development, satellite cells help to repair skeletal muscle cells. A satellite cell is similar to a myoblast because it is a type of stem cell; however, satellite cells are incorporated into muscle cells and facilitate the protein synthesis required for repair and growth. These cells are located outside the sarcolemma and are stimulated to grow and fuse with muscle cells by growth factors that are released by muscle fibers under certain forms of stress. Satellite cells can regenerate muscle fibers to a very limited extent, but they primarily help to repair damage in living cells. If a cell is damaged to a greater extent than can be repaired by satellite cells, the muscle fibers are replaced by scar tissue in a process called fibrosis. Because scar tissue cannot contract, muscle that has sustained significant damage loses strength and cannot produce the same amount of power or endurance as it could before being damaged. Smooth muscle tissue can regenerate from a type of stem cell called a pericyte, which is found in some small blood vessels. Pericytes allow smooth muscle cells to regenerate and repair much...\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- nucleus\\n\\n- mucus\\n\\n- cerebellum\\n\\n- cytoplasm\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"cytoplasm","rationale":"The correct answer is cytoplasm.\\nAs a myotube is formed from many different myoblast cells, it contains many nuclei, but has a continuous cytoplasm."},{"source":"Seeing stars may become more difficult as\\n\\nA -> stars are condensed in the sky\\n\\nB -> a greater amount of light is condensed in an area\\n\\nC -> floodlights are used at sea\\n\\nD -> spaceships begin to hover over earth\\n\\nIs the right answer A, B, C or D ?","target":"B","rationale":"Seeing stars means perceiving the light of distant stars.

Delia proceeds to marry Jim Ralston, and Charlotte comforts Clem, who enlists in the Union Army and is later killed in battle. Shortly after his death, Charlotte discovers she is pregnant with Clem's child, and in order to escape the stigma of an illegitimate child, she journeys West to have her baby, a daughter she names Clementina (or \\"Tina\\").\\nFollowing the end of the war, Charlotte and Tina relocate to Philadelphia, where Charlotte opens an orphanage. Delia is the mother of two children, and Charlotte is engaged to marry Joe Ralston, her cousin's brother-in-law.

Bluntly told them why I wouldn't let them and they did their own AITA in the general chat. Chaos ensued.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI go on many public Discord servers purely to share and discuss art that I or others have made. It's absolute bliss to know that people appreciate and would love to get art from me.\\n\\nHowever, one specific server that I had joined recently irked me. I wasn't particularly in with the general userbase and not very many were involved with the art community and the general etiquette. Regardless, I posted a work in progress of my art, hoping for a few bits of appreciation or discussion.\\n\\nOne user (let's call him Poe) comes in and tells me minutes after that my art was cool. Poe likes it, and wants to save it. Normally I'd be fine if it were a trustworthy server, but something about Poe's approach just really... creeped me out. It's quite hard to describe it without sounding hostile. It gave out red flags that I'd noted down as the general characteristics of an art thief. Deciding it's better safe than sorry, I left him hanging, deleted my art, and left the server altogether (also due to how ticked off I got with the userbase.) As an artist who's had to bust art thieves, it feels awful to just think about being in that situation.\\n\\nWhile I was done with directly interacting with that server, my friends (who still were inside just to watch how things went down) kept sending screenshots of daily events they found funny. Over the course of the next two or so days the occasional Poe-asking-to-do-X-with-art screenshot came up. Examples included Poe asking artists if he could digitalize their art (in the same creepy manner), which only reaffirmed my paranoia. Today, my friends told of how some people gave a user some critique on their art. Poe had basically told them their opinion was invalid because they weren't artists.\\n\\nThat was the last straw.\\n\\nI wanted to give my two cents on his statement, so I joined again, never intending to post any media.

I told him that while he might have been genuinely trying to be nice, it horrendously backfired on him. Poe then goes into complete damage control and says it was a joke, and to not be triggered. (I'm not quite sure how responding calmly is being triggered either.)\\n\\nSoon enough, it turned into a full scale argument. Poe's friends argued points that seemed real iffy to me.

Feeling that he could not be trusted, the author decided not to interact with Poe anymore. Eventually, however, an argument broke out in a public chatroom between several people over whether or not Poe's behavior was okay, and whether or not the authors suspicions were reasonable or justified.\\\\nBased on this analysis we conclude that while some people may disagree with how the author reacted to Poe's request initially (i.e., by deleting their artwork), we find no evidence here indicating that they were wrong overall given their concerns about him as described above.

Passage 1:\\"Telephone\\" was written by Lady Gaga, Rodney Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Lazonate Franklin and Beyoncé. Musically, the song has been described as dance-pop. Although constructed as a duet, Beyoncé's first appearance is in the middle verse. She sings her lyrics through a brief interlude, and later backs the chorus during the rest of the song. The song starts off unassumingly, with Gaga singing in a solemn voice over a harp melody, which changes immediately to a pounding beat. Essentially, Gaga is in a club and her boyfriend keeps calling, but she cannot talk as she was drinking and dancing to her favorite song. The chorus runs as follows: \\"Stop calling, stop calling, I don't want to talk anymore.\\" \\"Telephone\\" consists of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and an epilogue where a voice announces that the telephone line is not reachable at that moment. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals range from the low-note of F to the high-note of C. It is set in the key of F Dorian mode, and has a basic sequence of Fm–A–B–Fm as its chord progression.\\n Passage 2:During the reign of King Edward the Confessor a lady called Elviva (probably a Latin rendering of the Old English name Ælfgifu), held the manor of Ambrosden. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 she had been replaced by Hugh d'Ivry, butler of William the Conqueror and brother of Roger d'Ivry, who owned several manors in Oxfordshire. Hugh's nephew Roger II d'Ivry inherited Ambrosden and by 1194 it was part of the Honour of St. Valery. Ambrosden thus passed to Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who in 1288 gave the manor to Ashridge Priory of the Augustinian order of the Brothers of Penitence. Ashridge Priory retained Ambrosden until the priory was dissolved in 1539 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\\n Passage 3:The Lakers opened the series with a 115–109 victory at the Boston Garden. In Game 2, the Lakers led 113–111 with 18 seconds left when Gerald Henderson stole a James Worthy pass to score a game tying layup and the Celtics eventually prevailed in overtime 124–121. In Game 3, the Lakers raced to an easy 137–104 victory as Magic Johnson dished out 21 assists. After the game, Larry Bird said his team played like \\"sissies\\" in an attempt to light a fire under his teammates. In Game 4, the Lakers had a five-point game lead with less than a minute to play, but made several execution errors as the Celtics tied the game and then came away with a 129–125 victory in overtime. The game was also marked by Celtic forward Kevin McHale's takedown of Laker forward Kurt Rambis on a breakaway layup which triggered the physical aspect of the rivalry. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would go after Larry Bird later on in the third quarter, and 1981 Finals MVP Cedric Maxwell further antagonized the Lakers by following a missed James Worthy free throw by crossing the lane with his hands around his own neck, symbolizing that Worthy was \\"choking\\" under pressure. In Game 5, the Celtics took a 3–2 series lead as Larry Bird scored 34 points. The game was known as the \\"Heat Game\\", as it was played under 97 °F-heat, and without any air conditioning at the infamous Boston Garden. In Game 6, the Lakers evened the series with a 119–108 victory. In the game, the Lakers answered the Celtics rough tactics when Worthy shoved Cedric Maxwell into a basket support. After the game, a Laker fan threw a beer at Celtics guard M.L. Carr as he left the floor, causing him to label the series \\"all-out-war.\\" In Game 7, the Celtics were led by Cedric Maxwell, who had 24 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists as they came away with a 111–102 victory. In the game the Lakers rallied from a 14-point deficit to three points down with one minute remaining, when Maxwell knocked the ball away from Magic Johnson.

In 1734 an artillery school was established to impart Western-style artillery methods, but the Islamic clergy successfully objected under the grounds of theodicy. In 1754 the artillery school was reopened on a semi-secret basis. In 1726, Ibrahim Muteferrika convinced the Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha, the Grand Mufti, and the clergy on the efficiency of the printing press, and Muteferrika was later granted by Sultan Ahmed III permission to publish non-religious books (despite opposition from some calligraphers and religious leaders).

Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme.

Its main ideological positions were: the abrogation of sectarianism, political and social reforms, the clear proclamation of the Arab identity of Lebanon, and increased support for the Palestinians.

The \\"Kriegsmarine\\" was one of three official branchesalong with the \\"Heer (Army)\\" and the \\"Luftwaffe (Air Force)\\"of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany.\\n\\n- The 1st Marine Infantrie - Division was formed in February 1945 in Stettin from Marine - Schützen - Brigade Nord . Replacement troops were provided by 1.Marine - Infanterie - Ersatz und Ausbildungs - Bataillon located in Lübberstedt bei Wesermünde . Activated from Kriegsmarine forces it was active in north west Germany against Allied forces until the end of the war .\\n\\n- World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.\\n\\n- A navy or maritime force is a fleet of waterborne military vessels (watercraft) and its associated naval aviation, both sea-based and land-based. It is the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne combat operations and related functions. It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields; recent developments have included space-related operations. The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of Submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Naval operations can be broadly divided between riverine and littoral applications (brown-water navy), open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), and something in between (green-water navy), although these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division.\\n\\n- The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.\\n\\n- The Reichsmarine (\\"Navy of the Realm\\") was the name of the German Navy during the Weimar Republic and first two years of Nazi Germany. It was the naval branch of the \\"Reichswehr\\", existing from 1919 to 1935. In 1935, it became known as the \\"Kriegsmarine\\", a branch of the Wehrmacht; a change implemented by Adolf Hitler.\\n\\n- Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.\\n\\n- The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which '1st naval infantry division ' exhibits the relationship of 'part of'.

A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently $7.5 million in 2002 to $6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of...\\nBased on the previous passage, How is Legal Aid and Defender Association planning to cope with the funding drops? \\nIs \\"They will not be able to provide as many legal services\\" a correct answer?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The passage mentions that the Legal Aid and Defender Association will receive federal funds of \\"$8.7 million for next year\\", which is a $2 million drop from 2002.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"high frequencies","rationale":"The context mentions that high frequencies are reduced during recording, and the playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble (high frequencies) to reduce noise.

He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn.\\n\\nIn 1984, Little Richard filed a $112 million lawsuit against Specialty Records; Art Rupe and his publishing company, Venice Music; and ATV Music for not paying royalties to him after he left the label in 1959. The suit was settled out of court in 1986. According to some reports, Michael Jackson gave Little Richard monetary compensation from his work when he co-owned (with Sony-ATV) songs by the Beatles and Little Richard. In 1985, Charles White released Little Richard's authorized biography, Quasar of Rock: The Life and Times of Little Richard, which returned Little Richard to the spotlight. Little Richard returned to show business in what Rolling Stone would refer to as a \\"formidable comeback\\" following the book's release.  Reconciling his roles as evangelist and rock and roll musician for the first time, Little Richard stated that the genre could be used for good or evil. After accepting a role in the film Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Little Richard and Billy Preston penned the faith-based rock and roll song \\"Great Gosh A'Mighty\\" for its soundtrack. Little Richard won critical acclaim for his film role, and the song found success on the American and British charts. The hit led to the release of the album Lifetime Friend (1986) on Warner Bros. Records, with songs deemed \\"messages in rhythm\\", including a gospel rap track. In addition to a version of \\"Great Gosh A'Mighty\\", cut in England, the album featured two singles that charted in the UK, \\"Somebody's Comin'\\" and \\"Operator\\". Little Richard spent much of the rest of the decade as a guest on TV shows and appearing in films, winning new fans with what was referred to as his \\"unique comedic timing\\". In 1989, Little Richard provided rhythmic preaching and background vocals on the extended live version of the U2-B.B. King hit \\"When Love Comes to Town\\". That same year, Little Richard returned to singing his classic hits following a performance of \\"Lucille\\" at an AIDS benefit concert.  In 1990, Little Richard contributed a spoken-word rap on Living Colour's hit song, \\"Elvis Is Dead\\", from their album Time's Up. The following year, he was one of the featured performers on the hit single and video \\"Voices That Care\\" that was produced to help boost the morale of U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm. He also recorded a rock and roll version of \\"The Itsy Bitsy Spider\\" that year that led to a deal with Disney Records, resulting in the release of a hit 1992 children's album, Shake It All About. Throughout the 1990s, Little Richard performed around the world and appeared on TV, film, and tracks with other artists, including Jon Bon Jovi, Elton John and Solomon Burke.

Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the Progressive Movement, and most were theologically liberal, although a few were also conservative when it came to their views on social issues. Important leaders include Richard T. Ely, Josiah Strong, Washington Gladden, and Walter Rauschenbusch.\\n\\n- Josiah Strong ( April 14 , 1847 -- June 26 , 1916 ) was an American Protestant clergyman , organizer , editor and author . He was a leader of the Social Gospel movement , calling for social justice and combating social evils . He supported missionary work so that all races could be improved and uplifted and thereby brought to Christ . He is controversial , however , due to his beliefs about race and methods of converting people to Christianity . In his 1885 book Our Country , Strong argued that Anglo Saxons are a superior race who must \`\` Christianize and civilize '' the \`\` savage '' races , which he argued would be good for the American economy and the \`\` lesser races '' .\\n\\n- Richard Theodore Ely (April 13, 1854  October 4, 1943) was an American economist, author, and leader of the Progressive movement who called for more government intervention in order to reform what they perceived as the injustices of capitalism, especially regarding factory conditions, compulsory education, child labor, and labor unions. Ely is best remembered as a founder and the first Secretary of the American Economic Association, as a founder and secretary of the Christian Social Union, and as the author of a series of widely read books on the organized labor movement, socialism, and other social questions.\\n\\n- Washington Gladden (February 11, 1836  July 2, 1918) was a leading American Congregational pastor and early leader in the Social Gospel movement. He was a leading member of the Progressive Movement, serving for two years as a member of the Columbus, Ohio city council and campaigning against Boss Tweed as religious editor of the \\"New York Independent\\". Gladden was probably the first leading U.S. religious figure to support unionization of the workforce; he also opposed racial segregation. He was a prolific writer who wrote hundreds of poems, hymns, articles, editorials, and books.\\n\\n- Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.\\n\\n\\n\\n'josiah strong' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- canada\\n - economist\\n - editor\\n - founder\\n - justice\\n - leader\\n - missionary\\n - pastor\\n - philosopher\\n - religious\\n - theologian","target":"pastor","rationale":"Question: 'josiah strong' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?\\nAnswer: pastor"},{"source":"Read the following article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: I'm perfectly aware that many people you know probably think you re crazy for wanting to travel instead of settling into a typical 9-5 lifestyle.

Under either name, their gimmick was the same - two imposing muscular wrestlers in face paint.\\nContext: When Hawk left the WWF after SummerSlam 1992 he traveled to Japan and started working for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) where he quickly teamed up with young mid-carder Kensuke Sasaki who was soon dubbed \\"Power Warrior\\" as he adopted the trademark Road Warrior face paint and spiked shoulder pads.

Other notable songs he contributed to the band were \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You\\n\\nStills, Furay, and Young reunited in Los Angeles and formed the core of Buffalo Springfield. Legend has it that Stills and Furay recognized Young's converted hearse on the streets of LA and flagged him down, a meeting described in a recent solo track \\"Round the Bend.\\" The band would release three albums: Buffalo Springfield, Buffalo Springfield Again, and Last Time Around, and enjoy only one hit single, the Stills-penned \\"For What It's Worth\\" before disbanding. A Stills song from their debut album, \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You,\\" was a minor hit for the Mojo Men in 1967.  During the disintegration of Buffalo Springfield, Stills played on the Super Session album with Al Kooper and joined up with David Crosby, who had recently been ejected from the Byrds in the autumn of 1967. At a party in Laurel Canyon, Crosby was introduced to Graham Nash by a mutual friend, Cass Elliot (formerly of the Mamas and the Papas), and Nash found himself soon joining in singing with Crosby and Stills. Renditions of the latter's \\"You Don't Have to Cry,\\" led to the formation of Crosby, Stills & Nash. Several of Stills's songs, including \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" and \\"You Don't Have To Cry\\" on the debut album were inspired by his on-again-off-again relationship with singer Judy Collins. In a 1971 interview in Rolling Stone the interviewer noted, \\"so many of your songs seem to be about Judy Collins.\\" Stills replied, \\"Well, there are three things men can do with women: love them, suffer for them, or turn them into literature. I've had my share of success and failure at all three.\\"  The cover photo pictured on the debut was taken on the back porch of a house in West Hollywood, which was torn down the next day.

The tradition of such a meeting of Welsh artists dates back to at least the 12th century, when a festival of poetry and music was held by Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth at his court in Cardigan in 1176, but the decline of the bardic tradition made it fall into abeyance. The current format owes much to an 18th-century revival arising out of a number of informal eisteddfodau. The closest English equivalent to \\"eisteddfod\\" is \\"session\\"; the word is formed from two Welsh morphemes: \\"eistedd\\", meaning \\"sit\\", and \\"bod\\", meaning \\"be\\". In some countries, the term eisteddfod (plural often \\"eisteddfods\\") is used for certain types of performing arts competitions that have nothing to do with Welsh culture.\\nHistory.\\nThe date of the first eisteddfod is a matter of much debate among scholars but boards for the judging of poetry existed in Wales from at least the early 12th century. These judging boards had probably derived from ancient Celtic bardic traditions. The first recorded eisteddfod was held under the auspices of The Lord Rhys at Cardigan Castle in 1176. There he held a gathering to which were invited poets and musicians from all parts of Wales. A chair at the Lord's table was awarded to the best poet and musician, a tradition that prevails in the modern day National Eisteddfod. The earliest large-scale eisteddfod that is historically known is the Carmarthen Eisteddfod in 1451 under Thomas ap Gruffydd of Llandeilo (his illegitimate son was the soldier Rhys ap Thomas). \\n\\n- Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom.

The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted. Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the story line and characters in depth, explaining in the liner notes for the album's LP release:\\nArthur Morgan ... lives in a London suburb in a house called Shangri-La, with a garden and a car and a wife called Rose and a son called Derek who's married to Liz, and they have these two very nice kids, Terry and Marilyn. Derek and Liz and Terry and Marilyn are emigrating to Australia. Arthur did have another son, called Eddie. He was named after Arthur's brother, who was killed in the battle of the Somme. Arthur's Eddie was killed, too—in Korea.\\nDavies would later comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later \\"told me that he ... knew it [Arthur] had been partly inspired by him ... [it] reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, saying that he was flattered.\\" With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew (\\"Victoria\\", \\"Young and Innocent Days\\"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons (\\"Australia\\"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home (\\"Shangri-La\\"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War (\\"Mr. Churchill Says\\"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war (\\"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\\"), and the death of his brother in World War I (\\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", \\"Some Mother's Son\\").","target":"Ray","rationale":"The passage mentions that the Davies brother's older sister emigrated to Australia with her husband Arthur Anning.

While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police.  The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog.

Passage:Despite having claimed the Wild Card spot on the final day of the regular season, the Giants were able to tab ace Madison Bumgarner for the Wild Card game start. Bumgarner had an excellent regular season for the Giants, finishing with a career-low in ERA and a career-high in strikeouts, finishing fourth in the National League in both categories. On the hill for the New York Mets was Noah Syndergaard, who himself finished 3rd in the NL in ERA and 9th in strikeouts. The pitching matchup didn't disappoint, it took until the bottom of the third inning for the game's first hit and baserunner, with Syndergaard striking out four straight batters on two occasions. The closest either side came to scoring was in the top of the 6th when, after Denard Span singled and stole second base with two outs, Brandon Belt hit a long fly ball to center field which was caught on the dead run by Curtis Granderson, smashing into the wall and holding on. Syndergaard exited after 7 innings, having struck out 10. Crucially as it turned out, the Giants had forced Syndergaard out of the game with Bumgarner still going strong. Another golden opportunity was squandered by the Giants in the top of the 8th inning, when Addison Reed struck out Hunter Pence to end the inning with the bases loaded. After Bumgarner left a runner in scoring position in the bottom of the 8th, the game moved to the 9th with the Mets bringing in closer Jeurys Familia. Brandon Crawford led the inning off with a double to left-center, but Ángel Pagán couldn't lay down the sacrifice bunt and then struck out. Joe Panik worked a walk and Conor Gillaspie stepped up to the plate to launch a three-run home run to right field. Gillaspie had only started the game because Eduardo Núñez was still dealing with a hamstring injury and had to be left off the roster. Bumgarner then got the final three outs, completing the shutout just as he had done in the 2014 Wild Card Game. Bumgarner made 119 pitches, allowed just 6 total baserunners, striking out 6 and setting an MLB record of 23 consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason elimination games.

Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures. Aided by his control of the Censorate, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations. In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a \\"subject\\" of the Jin. But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the treaty never came into effect. A Jurchen army led by Wuzhu invaded in early 1140. The Song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains. Song general Liu Qi  won a battle against Wuzhu at Shunchang . Yue Fei was assigned to head the Song forces defending the Huainan region. Instead of advancing to Huainan, however, Wuzhu retreated to Kaifeng and Yue's army followed him into Jin territory, disobeying an order by Gaozong that forbade Yue from going on the offensive. Yue captured Zhengzhou and sent soldiers across the Yellow River to stir up a peasant rebellion against the Jin. On July 8, 1140, at the Battle of Yancheng, Wuzhu launched a surprise attack on Song forces with an army of 100,000 infantry and 15,000 horsemen. Yue Fei directed his cavalry to attack the Jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory. He continued on to Henan, where he recaptured Zhengzhou and Luoyang.

In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either.

After injury, the animals were randomly separated into three groups: the control group received a saline infusion for the 2-hour treatment period; the second group was given a blood transfusion over 2 hours titrated to maintain mean systemic arterial pressure (MSAP) at preinjury levels; and the third group received an intravenous bolus dose of naloxone (10 mg/kg), followed by a 2-hour infusion of intravenous naloxone (2 mg/kg/minute). The rats were observed postoperatively for 15 weeks, during which their clinical recovery was measured weekly by the inclined plane technique. At 15 weeks, the spinal cords were removed and prepared for histological assessment. The blood pressure before, during, and immediately after injury did not differ statistically among the three groups. During the initial 2 hours after injury, blood transfusion produced a significant increase in MSAP (P less than 0.02) and hematocrit (P less than 0.001), but naloxone infusion did not result in a significant change in MSAP. Performance on the inclined plane at 15 weeks was 35.6 +/- 6 degrees, 32.7 +/- 4 degrees, and 36.1 +/- 6 degrees for the control, transfusion, and naloxone groups, respectively, and no significant differences were found (P greater than 0.05). Histological examination confirmed a consistent injury of moderate severity in all three groups with no major differences among groups.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: The process of DNA replication is not always 100% accurate. Sometimes the wrong base is inserted in the new strand of DNA. This wrong base could become permanent. A permanent change in the sequence of DNA is known as a mutation. Small changes in the DNA sequence are usually point mutations, which is a change in a single nucleotide. Once DNA has a mutation, that mutation will be copied each time the DNA replicates. After cell division, each resulting cell will carry the mutation. A mutation may have no effect. However, sometimes a mutation can cause a protein to be made incorrectly. A defect in the protein can affect how well the protein works, or whether it works at all. Usually the loss of a protein function is detrimental to the organism. In rare circumstances, though, the mutation can be beneficial. Mutations are a mechanism for how species evolve. For example, suppose a mutation in an animals DNA causes the loss of an enzyme that makes a dark pigment in the animals skin. If the population of animals has moved to a light colored environment, the animals with the mutant gene would have a lighter skin color and be better camouflaged. So in this case, the mutation is beneficial. If a single base is deleted (called a deletion, which is also a point mutation), there can be huge effects on the organism, because this may cause a frameshift mutation. Remember that the bases in the mRNA are read in groups of three by the tRNA. If the reading frame is off by even one base, the resulting sequence will consist of an entirely different set of codons. The reading of an mRNA is like reading three-letter words of a sentence. Imagine the sentence: The big dog ate the red cat. If you take out the second letter from \\"big,\\" the frame will be shifted so now it will read: The bgd oga tet her edc at. One single deletion makes the whole sentence impossible to read. A point mutation that adds a base (known as an insertion) would also result in a frameshift. Mutations may also occur in chromosomes ( Figure 1.1). These mutations are going to be fairly large mutations, possible affecting many genes. Possible types of mutations in chromosomes include: 1. Deletion: When a segment of DNA is lost, so there is a missing segment in the chromosome. These usually result in many genes missing from the chromosome. 2. Duplication: When a segment of DNA is repeated, creating a longer chromosome. These usually result in multiple copies of genes in the chromosome. 3. Inversion: When a segment of DNA is flipped and then reattached to the same chromosome. 4. Insertion: When a segment of DNA from one chromosome is added to another, unrelated chromosome. 5. Translocation: When two segments from different chromosomes change positions. Many mutations are not caused by errors in replication. Mutations can happen spontaneously, and they can be caused by mutagens in the environment. Some chemicals, such as those found in tobacco smoke, can be mutagens. Sometimes mutagens can also cause cancer. Tobacco smoke, for example, is often linked to lung cancer. \\n Question: what type of mutation occurs when a segment of dna is flipped and then reattached to the same chromosome?","target":"inversion","rationale":"The answer to the given question is \\"inversion\\" as it explains what happens when a segment of DNA is flipped and then reattached to the same chromosome."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a sentence from the research paper and the category to which it belongs.

Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\".On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus.

Walter begins to have dreams of murdering Agatha. Walter tries to warn her about the number being dangerous and how it was going to come after her.

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]\\n\\nAt high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level.

East region had an alpine landscape, was situated in the mountains. North region was flat and located at sea level.\\n\\nHint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.","target":"East","rationale":"The paragraph describes two regions of a country and their different climates. The East region is described as having an alpine landscape, which means that it has high elevations like mountains. This suggests that the climate in this region would be cold at higher altitudes (the 'alpine tundra'), since cooler temperatures are characteristic of such places; furthermore, because the North region is flat and located at sea level its temperature would not drop significantly with elevation.

As a result, they have minimal rainfall throughout the year.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich place would see less chemical weathering, Horn of Africa or Arabian Peninsula?\\n\\nHint: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.","target":"Arabian Peninsula","rationale":"The Horn of Africa receives monsoons and Arabian Peninsula mostly misses the monsoon. So, the rainfall in these places will be different as well.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.\\n\\nJohn is studying the different states of matter.

After the death of the king the Leprechauns returned to their places of origin, all except one (Warwick Davis) who remained in the mortal world and through the ages slowly became corrupted and obsessed with the treasure he still guarded. In the present Father Jacob (Willie C. Carpenter) is chased through the construction site of the youth center he had planned on building by the Leprechaun, whose gold Jacob had taken to fund the building project. Using four-leaf clover laced holy water Jacob manages to banish the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after drops dead of injuries inflicted by the Leprechaun during the fight.One year later two down on their luck friends Emily Woodrow (Tangi Miller) and Lisa Duncan (Sherrie Jackson) have their fortune told when the clairvoyant Esmeralda (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil. While having a barbecue at the abandoned youth center construction site with Lisa, their stoner friend Jamie Davis (Page Kennedy) and her ex-boyfriend turned drug dealer Rory Jackson (Laz Alonso) Emily falls through a hole and discovers the Leprechaun's gold in an old tunnel where it was hidden by Father Jacob. Splitting up the gold (which is produced in a never ending amount by the chest it was contained in) evenly the quartet of friends use it to fulfill their fantasies, unaware that by taking the gold they have released the Leprechaun, who begins stalking the group (killing a guest who takes one of his coins at a party held by Jamie, prompting the police to temporarily arrest him). At the salon where Emily works the Leprechaun sneaks in and, after killing a regular customer, Doria, on the massage table by breaking her neck, attacks Emily, who barely escapes and warns Rory and the recently released Jamie, who rush to get to Lisa's. In her house Lisa is attacked by the Leprechaun and manages to fight him off for a short while, but is killed when the Leprechaun claws her in the stomach, with her friends finding her body moments later.While Emily and Jamie want to return the gold Rory does not and takes off with it; shortly after realizing Rory is gone Emily is attacked and chased outside by the Leprechaun, but is saved when Rory has a change of heart and comes back for her. Searching for Rory the Leprechaun stops by his house and kills Rory's profligate girlfriend Chanel (Keesha Sharp) by tearing out her upper jaw, reclaiming the gold she used to make a tooth while Rory and Emily are stopped and harassed by Officers Thompson (Beau Billingslea) and Whitaker (Chris Murray). After the Leprechaun appears and kills the two officers Emily and Rory escape and regroup with Jamie, only to be confronted by a machine gun wielding group of Rory's drug dealing rivals, led by Watson (Shiek Mahmud-Bey) and Cedric (Sticky Fingaz). Planning on executing Rory for infringing on their territory Watson and his gang are all disposed of by the Leprechaun, (who kills Watson and Cedric while the other two members run off) while Emily, Rory and Jamie drive off in Watson's car (which the Leprechaun latches to the bottom of for a short while) and go looking for help from Esmeralda.Advised to use four-leaf clovers against the Leprechaun by Esmeralda, Rory laces the hollow-point bullets of his gun with clovers Jamie finds in the marijuana Rory had earlier sold him. When the Leprechaun arrives Rory shoots him several times with the clover bullets, only for his gun to jam before he can finish the Leprechaun off. Rory and Emily are given the chance to run with the gold when the Leprechaun is distracted by Jamie and Esmeralda (the latter dying in a magical duel with the Leprechaun).

In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering.\\n\\n- The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family.\\n\\n- A panicle is a much-branched inflorescence. Some authors distinguish it from a compound spike, by requiring that the flowers (and fruit) be pedicellate. The branches of a panicle are often racemes. A panicle may have determinate or indeterminate growth.\\n\\n- Asteraceae or Compositae (commonly referred to as the aster, daisy, composite, or sunflower family) is an exceedingly large and widespread family of flowering plants (Angiospermae).\\n\\n- Connation in plants is the developmental fusion of organs of the same type, for example, petals to one another to form a tubular corolla. This is in contrast to adnation, the fusion of dissimilar organs. Such organs are described as connate or adnate, respectively. When like organs that are usually well separated are placed next to each other, but not actually connected, they are described as connivent (that is the case for anthers in several genera, such as \\"Solanum\\").\\n\\n- A raceme (or ) is an unbranched, indeterminate type of inflorescence bearing \\"pedicellate\\" flowersflowers having short floral stalks called pedicelsalong its axis. In botany, an \\"axis\\" means a shoot, in this case one bearing the flowers. In indeterminate inflorescence-like racemes, the oldest flowers are borne towards the base and new flowers are produced as the shoot grows, with no predetermined growth limit. A plant that flowers on a showy raceme may have this reflected in its scientific name, e.g. \\"Cimicifuga racemosa\\". A compound raceme, also called a panicle, has a branching main axis. Examples of racemes occur on mustard (genus \\"Brassica\\") and radish (genus \\"Raphanus\\") plants.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- In botany, shoots consist of stems including their appendages, the leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds. The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants.\\n\\n- Calamagrostis ( small reed or reed grass ) is a genus in the grass family Poaceae , with about 260 species that occur mainly in temperate regions of the globe . Towards equatorial latitudes , species of Calamagrostis generally occur at higher elevations . These tufted perennials usually have hairless narrow leaves . The ligules are usually blunt . The inflorescence forms a panicle . Some may be reed - like . The plants may be rhizomatous ( underground stems with shoots ) , stoloniferous ( with runners ) , or caespitose ( growing in tufts or clumps ) . The bisexual spikelets have a single floret and generally they are purple or purple - brown . The spikelets are clustered into inflorescences , which usually develop in early - to mid-summer on long culms ( = stems ) . Some Calamagrostis can be very decorative ; for example , in North America , Britain and Europe , a hybrid cultivar of Calamagrostis ( Calamagrostis x acutiflora ' Karl Foerster ' ) is widely grown as an ornamental grass . The word \`\` calamagrostis '' is derived from the Greek word kalamos ( reed ) and agrostis ( a kind of grass ) . Many species of Calamagrostis are morphologically similar , but they generally occur in distinct habitats , and they have unique geographical distributions . Given the subtle distinctions between many closely related taxa , there are several species complexes that could benefit from additional systematic study . Even the generic boundaries of the genus are controversial . For example , species in the genus Deyeuxia , distributed largely in the southern hemisphere are morphologically very similar to species of Calamagrostis . It may be appropriate to recognize all of these species in a single genus , but this will require detailed scientific study of DNA of species from around the world .\\n\\n- A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.\\n\\n- In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.\\n\\n- The Rubiaceae are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the coffee, madder, or bedstraw family. It consists of terrestrial trees, shrubs, lianas, or herbs that are recognizable by simple, opposite leaves with interpetiolar stipules. The family contains about 13,500 species in 611 genera, which makes it the fourth-largest angiosperm family. Rubiaceae has a cosmopolitan distribution, however, the largest species diversity is concentrated in the (sub)tropics. Economic importance includes \\"Coffea\\", the source of coffee, \\"Cinchona\\", the source of the antimalarial alkaloid quinine, some dye plants (e.g. \\"Rubia\\"), and ornamental cultivars (e.g. \\"Gardenia\\", \\"Ixora\\", \\"Pentas\\").\\n\\n- A lawn is an area of soil-covered land planted with grasses or (rarely) other durable plants such as clover which are maintained at a short height with a lawnmower and used for aesthetic and recreational purposes. Common characteristics of a lawn are that it is composed only of grass species, it is subject to weed and pest control, it is subject to practices aimed at maintaining its green color (e.g., watering), and it is regularly mowed to ensure an acceptable length, although these characteristics are not binding as a definition. Lawns are used around houses, apartments, commercial buildings and offices. Many city parks also have large lawn areas. In recreational contexts, the specialised names turf, pitch, field or green may be used, depending on the sport and the continent.\\n\\n- An inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem that is composed of a main branch or a complicated arrangement of branches. Morphologically, it is the part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed and which is accordingly modified. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes.\\nInflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern.\\n\\n- In botany, phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem (from Ancient Greek \\"phýllon\\" \\"leaf\\" and \\"táxis\\" \\"arrangement\\"). Phyllotactic spirals form a distinctive class of patterns in nature.\\n\\n- Poaceae or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses. Poaceae includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns (turf) and pasture. Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. With ca 780 genera and around 12,000 species, Poaceae are the fifth-largest , following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- Poa is a genus of about 500 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. \\"Poa\\" is Greek for fodder. \\"Poa\\" are members of the Pooideae subfamily of the Poaceae family.\\n\\n- A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.\\n\\n- The Fabaceae, Leguminosae or Papilionaceae, commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean family, are a large and economically important family of flowering plants. It includes trees, shrubs, and perennial or annual herbaceous plants, which are easily recognized by their fruit (legume) and their compound, stipulated leaves. The family is widely distributed, and is the third-largest land plant family in terms of number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 751 genera and some 19,000 known species\\n. The five largest of the genera are \\"Astragalus\\" (over 3,000 species), \\"Acacia\\" (over 1000 species), \\"Indigofera\\" (around 700 species), \\"Crotalaria\\" (around 700 species) and \\"Mimosa\\" (around 500 species), which constitute about a quarter of all legume species. The ca. 19,000 known legume species amount to about 7% of flowering plant species. Fabaceae is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.\\n\\n- Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae), however sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'calamagrostis'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- amaranthaceae\\n - angiospermae\\n - angiosperms\\n - animal\\n - area\\n - areas\\n - aster\\n - asteraceae\\n - axis\\n - bambusoideae\\n - cinchona\\n - coffea\\n - crotalaria\\n - cyperaceae\\n - fabaceae\\n - gardenia\\n - homo\\n - indigofera\\n - lamiaceae\\n - magnoliophyta\\n - mimosa\\n - orchidaceae\\n - pea\\n - pentas\\n - plant\\n - poa\\n - poaceae\\n - polygonaceae\\n - pooideae\\n - rubiaceae\\n - seed plants\\n - solanum","target":"pooideae","rationale":"In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus,[1] archaeon or bacterium.

Hay as a one-hour radio \\"barn dance\\" on WSM. Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history. Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits. It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners.\\n\\nFollowing the departure of the Opry, Ryman Auditorium sat mostly vacant and decaying for twenty years. An initial effort by National Life & Accident to tear down the Ryman and use its bricks to build a chapel at Opryland USA was met with resounding resistance from the public, including the influential musicians of the time. The plans were abandoned, and the building remained standing with an uncertain future. Despite the absence of performances, the building still held such significance as an attraction that it would remain open for tours.  In 1991 and 1992, Emmylou Harris performed a series of concerts there and released some of the recordings as an album entitled At the Ryman. The concert and album's high acclaim renewed interest in reviving Ryman Auditorium as an active venue. Beginning in September 1993, Gaylord Entertainment undertook a full renovation of the Ryman, restoring it into a world-class concert hall that reopened with a broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion on June 4, 1994.  On Sunday, October 18, 1998, the Opry held a benefit show at Ryman Auditorium, marking its return to the venue for the first time since its final show on March 15, 1974. The show was well received by fans, performers, and management alike, and so the decision was made to host the Opry's regular shows there on January 15 & 16, 1999 as part of the celebration to commemorate 25 years at the new venue.  Beginning in November 1999, the Opry was held at Ryman Auditorium for three months, partly due to the ongoing construction of Opry Mills. The Opry has returned to the Ryman for the three winter months every year since, allowing the show to acknowledge its roots while also taking advantage of a smaller venue during an off-peak season for tourism. While still officially the Grand Ole Opry, the shows there are billed as Opry At The Ryman.

By the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to The Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crowns, Acts of Union 1707 and Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty (1919–1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as Northern Ireland.\\nThe paragraph is about","target":"British Isles","rationale":"The paragraph is about the history of Great Britain and Ireland, including information such as: The first Anglo-Saxons arrived [...] Viking invasions began in the 9th century. \\nGiven this content it can be inferred that British Isles refers to a group of islands located off the north west coast of Europe which contain both England and Ireland within them."},{"source":"Passage: Nigeria at the FIFA World Cup -- Nigeria have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on six occasions, the first being in 1994 where they reached the second round.

So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma.

Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester:\\nFrom hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ...\\nThe surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ...

Here we show that the degree of LAV-mediated protection against intravenous wild-type SIVmac239 challenge strongly correlates with the magnitude and function of SIV-specific, effector-differentiated T cells in the lymph node but not with the responses of such T cells in the blood or with other cellular, humoral and innate immune parameters. We found that maintenance of protective T cell responses is associated with persistent LAV replication in the lymph node, which occurs almost exclusively in follicular helper T cells. Thus, effective LAVs maintain lymphoid tissue-based, effector-differentiated, SIV-specific T cells that intercept and suppress early wild-type SIV amplification and, if present in sufficient frequencies, can completely control and perhaps clear infection, an observation that provides a rationale for the development of safe, persistent vectors that can elicit and maintain such responses..

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states:\\n“Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.”\\nYet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration.

Selection of patients was made from among 206 cases of severe disease. Twenty-four patients (36%) sustained remission for at least 5 yr (mean, 11 +/- 0.6 yr) after initial therapy, and 42 (64%) relapsed and were retreated. Patients who sustained remission had shorter durations of illness before therapy (8 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 2 mo, p less than 0.05) and they had greater laboratory improvements during treatment. The frequencies of cirrhosis and death were not significantly greater in patients who relapsed. Of the 42 patients who relapsed, 9 (21%) ultimately entered a sustained remission after retreatment. Remission for at least 5 yr was possible in 33 of the 66 patients (50%). Major drug complications developed more commonly in those who relapsed and required retreatment (59% vs. 29%, p less than 0.05).

Despite not being a branch of the armed forces, the Guardia di Finanza is part of the military and operates a large fleet of ships, aircraft and helicopters, enabling it to patrol Italy's waters and to eventually participate in warfare scenarios. These five forces have military status and are all organized along military lines, comprising a total of 350,000 men and women with the official status of active military personnel.

She was the second daughter of Jose Maria Pinto da Cunha (17 February 1887 - 21 June 1938) and Maria Emilia Miranda (10 March 1886, Rio de Janeiro - 9 November 1971). In 1909, when Miranda was ten months old, her father emigrated to Brazil and settled in Rio de Janeiro, where he opened a barber shop.\\n\\nDesiring creative freedom, Miranda decided to produce her own film in 1947 and played opposite Groucho Marx in Copacabana. The film's budget was divided into about ten investors' shares. A Texan investor who owned one of the shares sent his brother, David Sebastian (23 November 1907 - 11 September 1990), to keep an eye on Miranda and his interests on the set. Sebastian befriended her, and they began dating.  Miranda and Sebastian married on 17 March 1947 at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, with Patrick J. Concannon officiating. In 1948 Miranda became pregnant, but miscarried after a show. Although the marriage was brief, Miranda (who was Catholic) did not want a divorce. Her sister, Aurora, said in the documentary Bananas is My Business: \\"He married her for selfish reasons; she got very sick after she married and lived with a lot of depression\\". The couple announced their separation in September 1949, but reconciled several months later.  Miranda was discreet, and little is known about her private life. Before she left for the U.S., she had relationships with Mario Cunha, Carlos da Rocha Faria (son of a traditional family in Rio de Janeiro) and Aloysio de Oliveira, a member of the Bando da Lua. In the U.S., Miranda maintained relationships with John Payne, Arturo de Cordova, Dana Andrews, Harold Young, John Wayne, Donald Buka and Carlos Niemeyer.

The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said. \\nQuestion: What was signed into law on Thursday by Republican Gov.

On 15 January 1775, the rebels took Chiang Mai, and overthrew the Burmese installed government. In November 1775, two Burmese armies of 35,000 were to invade Lan Na and Siam. But because of a mutiny by a senior commander, the southern army lost a significant portion of the troops. The remaining Burmese armies fought their way in. The northern army managed to capture Chiang Mai, albeit at a great cost, and the southern army took Sukhothai and Phitsanulok in central Siam. However, the invasion forces were too small to overcome the Siamese defences, and were bogged down. The armies withdrew in June 1776 after Hsinbyushin died. Hsinbyushin's successor Singu stopped the war with Siam, and demobilised much of the army. The decision was well received by the war-torn country. The people had grown tired of constant conscriptions to fight in \\"ever-lasting wars\\" in remote regions they had never heard of.

My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero.\\nThat illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work.

(A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy.  Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country.

A new coat-of-arms for the islands was introduced on 16 October 1925, consisting of the Desire (which was captained by John Davis who is reputed to have discovered the islands in 1592) and a sea lion in a shield surrounded by the motto of the islands, Desire the Right. This coat-of-arms later replaced the image of the bullock and ship on the flag.\\n Passage 2:He then transferred to India, traveling initially to Hamburg where, though both were in disguise and had no political principles in common, he was warned by Napper Tandy to flee to Danish territory in Altona. He continued overland through Germany, Austria, and Serbia, to the Euxine where he felt obliged to force his ship's captain at gunpoint to take him to Constantinople as agreed, rather than a corsair port for murder or slavery. He passed through Greece without recorded incidents, and took ship for Aleppo. He narrowly saved his own life, and his servant's, in the desert by curing the chief of a band of Arabs, who were planning to murder and rob him. He stayed for some time in Baghdad, where he was presented with a valuable Arabian horse by the Ottoman governor. From Basra he took ship for Bombay, then travelled overland to Madras. He was soon appointed to the command of the 19th Dragoons at Arcot, some 16 miles from Vellore.\\n Passage 3:Baca was not selected in either of the year's two drafts, but on July 8, 2011, Baca signed a Major League Soccer contract with the San Jose Earthquakes, with whom he had been training since February.

All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products.","target":"decrease","rationale":"In test A, Rob used lower concentration of reactants. The fact that the concentration is low means there are fewer chemical molecules in a given space. Using an analogy to cars on highway and neighborhood street, if we have less cars in freeway or more empty spaces between them then this will result in less frequency of crashes among those vehicles which translates into slower speed limit for drivers who wants to get somewhere quickly due to high risk factor associated with speeding down the road.\\nTherefore, it can be inferred that test A would decrease the frequency of collisions among molecules than test B did because there were lesser number of reactant molecules inside its container when compared with higher concentrations yielded by latter experiment's design plan (2nd trial)."},{"source":"Given the Target and Argument texts detect the stance that the argument has towards the topic.

EBM is a high - tech genre from the early ' 80s , combining industrial and electro music , from which later originated new beat and techno . Davo Da Davo and TB Frank veered between minimalistic industrial drones and odd , new wave synthpop and dance music , underlain by cold , mechanical rhythms . Their initial music is aggressive , danceable and dominated by synthesizers and drum - machines . A bit later on in their career , the guitar also had a prominent place in their music . The Neon Judgement recorded most of their output for the Play It Again Sam label in Belgium , beginning with 1986 's Mafu Cage . Their first American release did not come until 1987 , with the sex - themed concept album , Horny As Hell . Subsequent recordings included Blood and Thunder ( 1989 ) , The Insult ( 1990 ) , and Are You Real ( 1992 ) . The duo took a three - year hiatus to rethink the direction of their music , after which they returned in 1995 with At Devil 's Fork , an LP recorded with percussionist Ben Forceville entirely in a wooded area . The band briefly stopped performing in 1998 , but reformed in 2004 and started performing live again to promote a series of remixes and re-releases of their material . The touring continued into 2006 , with the band promising on their website that , \`\` Live , The Neon Judgement will continue to give art terrorism a good name , finding new ways of marrying noise and beauty , machines and magic '' . Dirk Da Davo is also in the side project Neon Electronics , for which he started his own record label Dancedelic - D and he both reworks old classics and composes new material . In November 2005 , the Neon Judgement did a show at the Machina Festival at the Broadway Club in São Paulo , Brazil ....\\n\\n- Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music, club music, or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In the United Kingdom and in continental Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'. \\n\\n- Electropunk is a music genre combining elements of electronic music and punk rock.\\n\\n- Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life.\\n\\n- Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word \\"techno\\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built.\\n\\n- Electronic body music (EBM) is a music genre that combines elements of post-industrial music and electropunk. It first came to prominence in Belgium and was considered a part of the European new wave movement.\\n\\n- Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production, an electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.\\n\\n- Detroit techno is a type of techno music that generally includes the first techno productions by Detroit-based artists during the 1980s and early 1990s. Detroit has been cited as the birthplace of techno. Prominent Detroit techno artists include Juan Atkins, Eddie Fowlkes, Derrick May, Jeff Mills, Kevin Saunderson, Blake Baxter, Santonio Echols and Mike Banks.\\n\\n- Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\".\\n\\n- Leuven or Louvain (; ) is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. It is located about east of Brussels. The municipality itself comprises the historic city and the former neighboring municipalities of Heverlee, Kessel-Lo, a part of Korbeek-Lo, Wilsele and Wijgmaal. It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders with more than 100,244 inhabitants (Federal Ministry of Home Affairs, 1/11/2016). \\n\\n- Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'the neon judgement' with the relationship of 'genre'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- album\\n - concert\\n - country\\n - culture\\n - dance music\\n - electronic body music\\n - electronic music\\n - genre\\n - government\\n - history\\n - industrial rock\\n - law\\n - music\\n - musical\\n - new wave\\n - politics\\n - punk rock\\n - rock\\n - techno\\n - urban\\n - western","target":"punk rock","rationale":"the neon judgement is a punk rock band.\\nband and genre is the relationship between them."},{"source":"In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below.

This means that step A, when the noble gases are kept in containers, would not result in electron jumping to a higher energy level.

The band's members are Jon Foreman (lead vocals, guitar), Tim Foreman (bass guitar, backing vocals), Chad Butler (drums, percussion), Jerome Fontamillas (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and Drew Shirley (guitar, backing vocals). After early successes in the Christian rock scene, Switchfoot first gained mainstream recognition with the inclusion of four of their songs in the 2002 movie A Walk to Remember. This recognition led to their major label debut, The Beautiful Letdown, which was released in 2003 and featured the hits \\"Meant to Live\\" and \\"Dare You to Move\\".\\n\\nIn 2005 prior to the release of Nothing Is Sound Switchfoot announced that guitarist Drew Shirley (previously the guitarist for All Together Separate) had become the band's fifth member after touring with the band since 2003. Nothing Is Sound, was released on September 13, 2005, and with Shirley's inclusion saw Switchfoot's sound become even more densely layered and guitar-heavy, resulting in an album that was edgier and darker than any of their previous work. \\"Stars\\" was released as the first radio single to promote the album, and was a solid hit on mainstream and alternative rock radio stations. It was also used in ads for HBO. \\"We Are One Tonight\\" was released as the second single in early 2006, and was also featured in ads for the 2006 Winter Olympics.  The album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, an all-time high for the band, while bassist Tim Foreman attracted headlines by speaking out against the copy-protection used by the label and providing fans a detailed workaround on the band's message board, which was quickly deleted by Sony. This copy-protection is known as Extended Copy Protection, which has been identified by leading anti-virus companies as a trojan horse and a rootkit.  During the Spring 2006 leg of the Nothing Is Sound Tour, the band introduced \\"a video diary of life on the road\\" in the form of free video podcasts available via iTunes and streaming online on YouTube.

Li was also the runner-up at the 2013 Australian Open and 2013 WTA Tour Championships, a three-time quarterfinalist at Wimbledon and a semifinalist at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and 2013 US Open. Among her other most notable accolades, she was the first Chinese player to win a WTA tour title at the Guangzhou International Women's Open in 2004, the first to reach a Grand Slam singles quarterfinal at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, and the first to break into the world's top 10. Her feats have sparked a major population growth of tennis players in East Asia, earning her the reputation as the region's tennis pioneer and trailblazer.\\n\\n- The Guangzhou International Women 's Open is a tennis tournament held in Guangzhou , People 's Republic of China .

We have recently shown that blockade of the CC chemokine receptor CCR1 reduces interstitial inflammation and fibrosis in murine obstructive nephropathy. However, it is not known whether CCR 1 blockade is protective in progressive renal injury associated with severe proteinuria. We therefore studied the effect of the small-molecule CCR1 antagonist BX471 in a murine model of adriamycin-induced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with nephrotic syndrome and progressive interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.', 'Adriamycin nephropathy with persistent proteinuria was induced in male BALB/c mice by two intravenous injections of adriamycin (13 mg/kg) at day 0 and 14. BX471 treatment was started at day 14 when proteinuria and interstitial inflammation had developed. At 6 weeks, renal histology was studied by morphometry and immunohistochemistry.', 'At week 6, adriamycin-treated mice showed FSGS, associated with tubulointerstitial injury consisting of tubular dilation and atrophy, interstitial leukocyte infiltration, and fibrosis. The mRNA expression of CCR1 and CC chemokines, including the CCR1 ligands CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) and CCL5 (RANTES), was up-regulated in diseased kidneys, with a prominent interstitial expression of CCL5. Compared to vehicle-treated controls BX471 significantly reduced the amount of macrophages and T lymphocytes in interstitial lesions by 51% and 22%, respectively. Markers of renal fibrosis such as interstitial fibroblasts (48%) and interstitial volume (23%) were significantly reduced by BX471 treatment.

Passage 1:The original church was built as a chapel of ease of St Mary's, Lancaster in 1745 on land bequeathed for the purpose in the will of Francis Bowes, the village blacksmith, who died in 1742. This was before the creation of the town of Morecambe from three former villages; this building was in Poulton-le-Sands. By the early 1800s the chapel was too small for the growing population. It was rebuilt in 1840–41 to a design by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. The foundation stone was laid on 16 June 1840, and the new church was consecrated on 15 June 1841 by the Bishop of Chester. The church cost £1,288 () to build, and Queen Victoria made a personal contribution to this. As originally built, the church seated 498 people. A south aisle was added in 1866 by Sharpe's successor, E. G. Paley. In 1897 Austin and Paley, (further successors in the architectural practice), added a new chancel, an organ chamber, and vestries, and provided an additional 69 seats, at an estimated cost of £1,160. A Lady chapel was created in the southeast of the church in 1966. In 1995 the church was re-ordered to celebrate 250 years since the foundation of the church.\\n Passage 2:Born in Machakos, he began running seriously around 2004 in the hope he could make a living out of the sport.

His technique was poor and his coach, Paul Mutwii, turned to Boniface Teren, the Kenyan national steeplechase coach, for help. Working with Teren, Ndiku's technique over the barriers greatly improved and one year later he won the gold medal at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics, beating Uganda's Benjamin Kiplagat who had built up a sizeable lead in the early stages. Ndiku's winning time of 8:17.28 minutes was enough to rank the 16-year-old in the top 25 athletes in the world that year, as well as being the fastest ever recorded by a youth category athlete. His flat speed also improved, as he won the 1500 metres at the Commonwealth Youth Games that year. He also competed in Japan that year. After signing up with the Hitachi Cable corporate running team, he set track bests of 7:54.04 minutes for the 3000 metres, 13:21.17 minutes for the 5000 metres and 28:08.28 minutes for the 10,000 metres.\\n Passage 3:The 2016 NFL Draft was the 81st annual meeting of National Football League (NFL) franchises to select newly eligible American football players.

Ruling that the order was mutually binding, Judge Thornton also cited the men for contempt. \\"It drives me nuts when people just decide to do whatever they want,\\" said Judge Thornton, who is experienced in the state's thick domestic abuse docket, which produces close to 30,000 emergency protective orders a year. Kentucky officials say there is a virtual epidemic of abusive relationships in the state. Judge Thornton's ruling has alarmed advocates for battered women, who plan to appeal it. The advocates say the finding goes beyond existing law and is unrealistic because some renewed contacts often prove unavoidable in domestic abuse cases, which involve economic and family dependency and other complications of daily living. The state office on domestic violence has pointedly agreed, warning that the ruling could cause abused women to hesitate in bringing their plight before the courts for fear of being chastised for their trouble. \\"The reality is it's easy to say they should never have contact,\\" said Sherry Currens, executive director of the Kentucky Domestic Violence Association, an advocacy and legal protection group. \\"But we're talking about people in long-term relationships.

My girlfriend tensed up, and you could see she didn't like the ongoing conflict.

Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to specific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions, such as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface. Cilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in unison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it helps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that sweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator because it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous blanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the acidic environment of your stomach.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- mast cells\\n\\n- nerve cells\\n\\n- connective tissue\\n\\n- epithelial cells\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"epithelial cells","rationale":"The paragraph explains that epithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces.

A total of 219 patients with active RA in whom treatment with biologic agents had failed were enrolled in a 3-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of R788. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieved an ACR20 response) at month 3. Secondary end points included changes in inflammation and damage, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and changes in the Disease Activity Score. The ACR20 response in the R788 100 mg twice daily group was 38%, versus 37% in the placebo group, at month 3. No significant differences were achieved in the ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70 response levels at 3 months. There were differences between the groups from baseline to month 3 in the secondary end points C-reactive protein (CRP) level and synovitis score on MRI. There were baseline differences in steroid use, prior biologic use, and synovitis score on MRI between the R788 group and the placebo group that may have affected the outcomes. A high placebo response rate was seen in this trial, and exploratory analysis suggested that this may in part have been driven by patients who entered the trial with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate but normal CRP level. Our findings indicate that there were no differences in the primary end point between the R788 and placebo groups.

We postulated that the CFV pattern after IRA reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) would predict long-term adverse cardiac events.', 'Sixty-eight consecutive patients with a first AMI underwent CFV measurement with a Doppler guidewire after successful reopening of the IRA by coronary angioplasty. At the end of follow-up, 3.8+/-1.7 years after AMI, 44 of the 65 surviving patients (67.7%) were free of long-term cardiac events. Univariate analysis showed that the following factors were predictive of an end point combining cardiac death, recurrent MI, and congestive heart failure: hypertension, age > or =65 years, time from onset of chest pain to PTCA > or =6 hours, peak creatine kinase >4000 IU/L, ejection fraction < or =50%, proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion, resting average peak velocity < or =10 cm/s, average systolic peak velocity < or =5 cm/s, a rapid diastolic deceleration time (< or =600 ms), and early retrograde systolic flow.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists...\\n\\nQuestion: What is the name of the person who made their fair share of provocative statements for the Western media?\\nI found this answer \\"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\".

Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.","target":"decapitation","rationale":"The passage mentions that serious crimes, such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution.

The independence of Georgia had been recognized by Soviet Russia in the Treaty of Moscow, signed on 7 May 1920, and the subsequent invasion of the country was not universally agreed upon in Moscow. It was largely engineered by two influential Georgian-born Soviet Russian officials, Joseph Stalin and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, who on 14 February 1921 got the consent of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin to advance into Georgia, on the pretext of supporting  \\"peasants and workers rebellion\\" in the country.

Long  hair represented our freed inner selves.\\nMy clients are often surprised when I asked them questions about their hairstyle--why they choose it, how else they've worn their hair, how they feel about it, and so on. However, while it may  seem  to  be  a  simple  topic,  even  today  our  hairstyles  still  have many  psychological  and emotional meanings.
