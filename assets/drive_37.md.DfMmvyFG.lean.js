A disadvantage of this approach is the decreased ability to resect cysts in their entirety. Correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and cyst content could potentially help surgeons decide on the extent of resection and approach. We attempted to identify a correlation between patients' MRI imaging patterns and difficult cyst removal, post-operative adverse outcomes and the need for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion, in order to detect markers that may affect pre-surgical planning.\\", \\"A retrospective examination of all patients' records that underwent a colloid cyst excision attempt at our institution between 2001 and 2014, and which had a minimum 1-year follow-up was compiled.\\", 'Of the 25 patients fulfilling the criteria, we found cysts with a low T2 signal, specifically when combined with high T1 signal, to be significantly correlated with piecemeal, difficult removals. Correlation was also found between high T2 signal cysts and pre-operative hydrocephalus. Among patients that had pre-existing hydrocephalus, those that required a piecemeal removal possessed a strong trend towards a need for subsequent shunting.\\nAnswer: We found specific MRI features suggestive of difficult cyst excision. In a subgroup of patients with pre-operative hydrocephalus and imaging features suggestive of difficult removal, significantly higher rates of shunting were observed. We therefore recommend an open approach in cases of low T2, high T1 signal cysts with a diameter of over 15 mm, or CSF shunting in poor surgical candidates. Smaller cysts, with a low T1 signal, a high T2 signal and pre-operative hydrocephalus, constitute a subgroup in which we recommend endoscopic intervention as the procedure of choice.","target":"Do mRI features have a role in pre-surgical planning of colloid cyst removal?","rationale":"The given context passage and answer contains information regarding the role of MRI features in pre-surgical planning of colloid cyst removal.

A long thin wire used as a half-wave dipole (or quarter wave monopole) will have a reactance significantly greater than the resistive impedance it has at resonance, leading to a poor match and generally unacceptable performance. Making the element using a tube of a diameter perhaps 1/50 of its length, however, results in a reactance at this altered frequency which is not so great, and a much less serious mismatch which will only modestly damage the antenna's net performance.

When you select your career, there's whole lot more to it than assessing your skills and matching them with a particular position. If you ignore your personality, it will hurt you long-term regardless of your skills or the job's pay. There are several areas of your personality that you need to consider to help you find a good job. Here are a few of those main areas:\\n1) Do you prefer working alone or with other people?\\nThere are isolating   jobs that will drive an outgoing person crazy and also interactive jobs that will make a shy person uneasy. Most people are not extremes in either direction but do have a tendency that they prefer. There are also positions that are sometimes a combination of the two, which may be best for someone in the middle who adapts easily to either situation.\\n2) How do you handle change?\\nMost jobs these days have some elements of change to them, but some are more than others. If you need stability in your life, you may need a job where the changes don't happen so often. Other people would be bored of the same daily routine.\\n3) Do you enjoy working with computers?\\nI do see this as a kind of personality characteristic. There are people who are happy to spend more than 40 hours a week on a computer, while there are others who need a lot of human interaction throughout the day. Again, these are extremes and you'll likely find a lot of positions somewhere in the middle as well.\\n4) What type of work environment do you enjoy?\\nThis can range from being in a large building with a lot of people you won't know immediately to a smaller setting where you'll get to know almost all the people there fairly quickly.\\n5) How do you like to get paid?\\nSome people are motivated by the pay they get, while others feel too stressed to be like that.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair.\\nTaken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”.\\nSo how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.\\nBut the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range.\\nSo how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet.\\nSportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone.\\nThis has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day.

Animals don't have soap , but they do keep themselves clean. Many animals with hair, such as dogs and cats, keep themselves clean by licking  their hair. They also use their teeth to pull out small dirty things from their hair. When they lick their hair, it is almost as if they are using a wet brush to clean themselves.\\nBirds take baths to stay clean. First they walk through water that is not deep. Next they beat  their wings to dry themselves. Birds also take sand baths on the ground. It is thought that they do this to drive away parasites .\\nEven fish need cleaning. Fish have very little parasites that live in their mouths. Some fish live by eating these parasites off other fish. Such fish are called \\"cleaner fish\\". Larger fish will open their mouths so that the cleaner fish can get in to clean.\\nSome animals that live in groups clean each other, such as monkeys. They often clean one another.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]","target":"Second day","rationale":"A wood-decay fungus needs excessive moisture to grow and thrive.

Recorded as an intent for Gaye to remit a portion of its royalties to her to receive alimony payments, it performed poorly on the charts. During that period, Gaye developed a serious dependence and addiction to cocaine and was dealing with several financial issues with the IRS. These issues led him to move to Maui, Hawaii, where he struggled to record a disco album. In 1980, Gaye went on a European tour. By the time the tour stopped, the singer relocated to London when he feared imprisonment for failure to pay back taxes, which had now reached upwards of $4.5 million (US$13,365,509 in 2017 dollars).  Gaye then reworked Love Man from its original disco concept to another personal album invoking religion and the possible end time from a chapter in the Book of Revelation. Titling the album In Our Lifetime?, Gaye worked on the album for much of 1980 in London studios such as Air and Odyssey Studios.  In the fall of that year, someone stole a master tape of a rough draft of the album from one of Gaye's traveling musicians, Frank Blair, taking the master tape to Motown's Hollywood headquarters. Motown remixed the album and released it on January 15, 1981. When Gaye learned of its release, he accused Motown of editing and remixing the album without his consent, allowing the release of an unfinished production (Far Cry), altering the album art of his request and removing the album title's question mark, muting its irony. He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished Picasso painting. Gaye then vowed not to record any more music for Motown.  On February 14, 1981, under the advice of music promoter Freddy Cousaert, Gaye relocated to Cousaert's apartment in Ostend, Belgium. While there, Gaye shied away from heavy drug use and began exercising and attending a local Ostend church, regaining personal confidence. Following several months of recovery, Gaye sought a comeback onstage, starting the short-lived Heavy Love Affair tour in England and Ostend in June-July 1981. Gaye's personal attorney Curtis Shaw would later describe Gaye's Ostend period as \\"the best thing that ever happened to Marvin\\". When word got around that Gaye was planning a musical comeback and an exit from Motown, CBS Urban president Larkin Arnold eventually was able to convince Gaye to sign with CBS. On March 23, 1982, Motown and CBS Records negotiated Gaye's release from Motown. The details of the contract were not revealed due to a possible negative effect on the singer's settlement to creditors from the IRS.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"What  year was his last Motown recordings ?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"January 15, 1981.","rationale":"The context clearly states:\\n\\"He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished Picasso painting.

The first incident involved my 5lb dog. His dog &amp; my dog both ate dinner &amp; there must have been a morsel on the floor bc suddenly he growled &amp; snapped &amp;, as my ex describes it, “put Lila’s head inside his mouth” but he didn’t bite bc there would’ve been puncture wounds. In the 2nd incident, my daughter’s 11-year-old friend came over. Normally he’d introduce his dog to new people, but he was in the bathroom&amp; I was taking a nap. My daughter opened the door (he had told her to wait until he was out of the bathroom &amp; she didn’t listen) &amp; his dog lunged at the little girl &amp; bit her hand. Her hand was bruised &amp; bleeding, she had to go to urgent care &amp; skip volleyball camp for a week.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan.

Differentiation was originally thought to be irreversible, but phenotypic plasticity has been observed in a variety of cell types, for example sympathetic neurones, the limb blastema and some glial cell types. A detailed description of the individual steps that lead to expression or reversal of phenotype is essential to understand the molecular events underlying cell differentiation. We examined whether ciliary neurones acquire adrenergic properties when exposed to a permissive embryonic environment. Cholinergic neurones were selectively labelled with a retrogradely transported marker and injected into chick embryos during active neural crest migration. Four to five days after injection, some of the labelled neurones were found in 'adrenergic sites' and had developed catecholamine histofluorescence. The cells had thus accumulated adrenergic neurotransmitters even after differentiation into cholinergic neurones. This result shows that neurotransmitter plasticity occurs in cholinergic neurones and suggests that the neurotransmitter phenotype can be modified by the embryonic environment.","target":"Cholinergic neurones acquire adrenergic neurotransmitters when transplanted into an embryo","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nCholinergic neurones acquire adrenergic neurotransmitters when transplanted into an embryo."},{"source":"Solve -147*p + 1571*p + 1969 = 9089 for p.\\nSolve this problem.","target":"5","rationale":"We need to isolate the variable p on one side of the equation.\\n\\n[STEP 1] -147*p + 1571*p = 9089-1969\\n[STEP 2] 1424 * p = 7120 \\n[STEP3] p = 7120 /1424 \\n[STEP4] p = 5"},{"source":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What's the first name of the person Sam's friend sees die at the gym?, using the article: Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing.

In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its \\"watcher\\", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.In 1910, the owner of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also purchased the Old Lifeboat House at the end of the spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.The Point was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954, along with the adjacent Cley Marshes reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986.

As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia.\\n\\nHint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.","target":"Danny","rationale":"The context says that Danny has hypercalcaemia, and Greg had hypocalcaemia. Hypercalcemia is when there are excessive amounts of calcium in the blood (over 10mg/dL), while hypocalcemia is when there aren't enough calcium ions circulating in extracellular fluids (under 8.5 mg/dl). \\nOne cause of hypercalcaemia mentioned in the passage above is an excessive intake of vitamin D or PTH hormone, which increases absorption of minerals like calcium from food into your bloodstream. Since Danny's condition was caused by an excess amount of something that causes more mineral to be absorbed into your bloodstream than normal, it can be inferred he had an excessive intake of a substance related to increased absorption like vitamin D or parathyroid hormones.

The Allman Brothers Band was formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1969. The band had great success in the early 1970s. Allman is best remembered for his brief but influential tenure in the band and in particular for his expressive slide guitar playing and inventive improvisational skills.\\n\\nDuane Allman was born on November 20, 1946, in Nashville, Tennessee. He was the eldest son of Willis Allman (1918-1949), a World War II non-commissioned officer turned recruiting officer in the United States Army, and Geraldine Allman (nee Robbins) (1917-2015). His brother, Gregg, was born on December 8, 1947.  On December 26, 1949, when the family was living near Norfolk, Virginia, Willis Allman was murdered. In order to retrain as an accountant, Geraldine \\"Mama A\\" Allman sent Duane and Gregg to Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee, which they both disliked intensely. In 1957, the family moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, where the boys attended Seabreeze High School.  The boys returned to Nashville to spend summers with their grandmother, and there Gregg learned guitar basics from a neighbor. In 1960, he had saved enough money to buy his first guitar, a Japanese-made Teisco Silvertone, while Duane acquired a Harley 165 motorbike. Despite Duane being left-handed, he played the guitar right-handed. Duane began to take an interest in the guitar, and the boys would sometimes fight over it, until Duane wrecked the motorbike and traded it for a Silvertone of his own. His mother eventually bought Duane a Gibson Les Paul Junior.  It was also in Nashville that the boys became musically inspired by a rhythm and blues concert where they saw blues guitar legend B. B. King perform. Duane told Gregg, \\"We got to get into this.\\" Duane learned to play very quickly and soon became the better guitarist of the two.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Duane Allman","rationale":"Duane Allman is the name of a guitarist that was born in 1946 and died following a motorcycle accident.

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.","target":"East","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that the East region had an alpine landscape and was situated in the mountains, while North region was flat and located at sea level. Since only one of these regions has mountain landscapes with high elevations, it is likely that this would be where we could find an alpine tundra climate.\\nAlpine climates are characterized by cold temperatures (especially at night), a lack of precipitation due to rain shadow effects caused by windward sides of mountains moving air masses upwards and forcing them to cool down during their ascent so they do not reach their water condensation point anymore when reaching higher altitudes again on the leeward side of a mountain range resulting in increased loss of moisture from transpiration, as well as significant differences between summer and winter temperature ranges: summers being relatively mild"},{"source":"What was likely said next?

They are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. Her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (F), 6 years (M), and 13 years (F). My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. For whatever reason CPS never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHer parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it.

Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.\\n\\nHint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.","target":"Sean","rationale":"The context indicates that Sean read about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, while Gabe read about other influencing factors. Raising the temperature is an important factor in determining reaction rate and activation energy barrier size because it results in more effective collisions between reacting particles. This means that Sean would have most likely studied activation energy barriers as part of his research into how temperature affects chemical reactions, making him a better candidate for reading more about them than Gabe.\\nThus, since increasing the temperature increases collision frequency, which can ultimately increase or decrease the activation energy barrier size depending on circumstances (e.g., catalyst availability), we conclude that student \\"Sean\\" has probably done some reading regarding this issue."},{"source":"For thousands of years, people have found fossils.

No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after  Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were sold for as much as $500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956.

Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed.

Another report, on Americans learning Russian, showed a direct improvement of ability over the age range tested; that is, the ability to learn increased as the age increased, from childhood to adulthood.\\nThere are several possible explanations for these findings.

TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

Cassavetes was a pioneer of American independent film, writing and directing over a dozen movies, which he partially self-financed, and pioneered the use of improvisation and a realistic cinéma vérité style. He also acted in many Hollywood films, notably \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" (1968) and \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" (1967). He studied acting with Don Richardson, using an acting technique based on muscle memory. His income from acting made it possible for him to direct his own films independently.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Dogville is a 2003 internationally co-produced avant-garde drama film written and directed by Lars von Trier, and starring an ensemble cast led by Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Chloë Sevigny, Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsgård, Udo Kier, Ben Gazzara, and James Caan. It is a parable that uses an extremely minimal, stage-like set to tell the story of Grace Mulligan (Kidman), a woman hiding from mobsters, who arrives in the small mountain town of Dogville, Colorado, and is provided refuge in return for physical labor. Because she has to win and retain the acceptance of every single one of the inhabitants of the town to be allowed to stay, any attempt by her to have her own way or to put a limit on her service risks driving her back out into the arms of the criminals. Although she has no power in herself, her stay there ultimately changes the lives of the local people and the town in many ways.\\n\\n- Evergreen Review is a U.S.-based literary magazine founded by Barney Rosset, publisher of Grove Press.

Gambling thus requires three elements be present: consideration, chance and prize.

Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\\n\\n- Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person).\\nGlobally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.\\nIn 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.\\nViolence in many forms is preventable.

The stories are written in both the first and third-person, in Bukowski's trademark semi-autobiographical short prose style. In keeping with his other works, themes include: Los Angeles bar culture; alcoholism; gambling; sex and violence. However, many of the stories contain elements of fantasy and surrealism. The book was initially printed as \\"Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness\\" . The stories originally appeared in \\"Open City\\", \\"Nola Express\\", \\"Knight\\", \\"Adam\\", \\"Adam Reader\\", \\"Pix\\", \\"The Berkeley Barb\\" and \\"Evergreen Review\\".\\n\\n- Paris, je t'aime (\\"Paris, I love you\\") is a 2006 anthology film starring an ensemble cast of actors of various nationalities.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.\\n\\n- Henry Charles Bukowski (born Heinrich Karl Bukowski; August 16, 1920  March 9, 1994) was a German-born American poet, novelist, and short story writer.\\n\\n- Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy).\\n\\n- Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.\\nBoth environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the...\\n\\n- The Big Lebowski is a 1998 American crime comedy film written, produced, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.

Passage 1:Irene was daughter of despotēs Theodore Komnenos Doukas, ruler of Epirus, and Maria Petraliphaina (sister of the sebastokratōr John Petraliphas). In 1230 Irene and her family were captured by the troops of tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria in the battle of Klokotnitsa and they were taken in Tarnovo, where Irene grew up in the Palace. Irene became known for her beauty and the widowed tsar fell in love with her. They married in 1237. According to a Byzantine author, Ivan Asen II loved Irene \\"no less than Antony loved Cleopatra\\", and she may have been his mistress for some years before their marriage in 1237. By marrying Irene, Ivan Asen II would have broken church canons, as his daughter, Maria Asanina Komnena, from his marriage to Anna (Anisia) was married to Irene's uncle, Manuel of Thessalonica. There is some evidence that the Bulgarian church opposed the marriage and that a patriarch (called either Spiridon or Vissarion) was deposed or executed by the irate tsar.\\n Passage 2:Dido Elizabeth Belle was born into slavery in 1761 in the British West Indies to an enslaved African woman known as Maria Belle. (Her name was spelled as Maria Bell in her daughter's baptism record.) Her father was 24-year-old Sir John Lindsay, a member of the Lindsay family of Evelix branch of the Clan Lindsay and a descendant of the Clan Murray, who was a career naval officer and then captain of the British warship HMS Trent, based in the West Indies. He was the son of Sir Alexander Lindsay, 3rd Baronet and his wife Amelia, daughter of David Murray, 5th Viscount Stormont. Lindsay is thought to have found Maria Belle held as a slave on a Spanish ship which his forces captured in the Caribbean; he appears to have taken her as his concubine (see plaçage). Lindsay returned to London after the war in 1765 with his young daughter, Dido Belle. When they arrived in England he took her to Kenwood House just outside the city, the home of his uncle, William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, and his wife Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Mansfield. Belle was baptised as Dido Elizabeth Belle in 1766 at St. George's, Bloomsbury. The Murray family raised Belle as an educated woman along with their niece and Dido's cousin, Lady Elizabeth Murray, whose mother had died. However, Belle remained a slave until Mansfield finally granted her freedom from slavery in his will in 1793.\\n Passage 3:Route 104 begins at an intersection with Route 137 in the Bulls Head section of Stamford and heads north, passing by GE Capital, then crossing the Rippowam River, up through North Stamford and onto New York state line.

They decide they need to meet outside of school sometime so they can share pets since they both like playing with different animals.\\n\\nIs Greg's or Lucy's pet unable to breathe through its skin?\\n\\nHint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews.

During the tests, each baby wore a hat with sensors  . The babies watched a series of images on a computer screen. _ showed the same object, such as a cartoon character. For a while, the number of the objects in the pictures didn't change. Then the images began to display a different object, or a different number of one of the objects the babies had previously looked at. As soon as something changed, the babies' brains responded with a specific pattern of electrical signals, which would be recorded by sensors.\\nBy analyzing these signals, the researchers discovered that one part of the brain (near the top on the left side) responded when the object in the image changed. A different part of the brain (lower and on the right side) responded when the number of objects in the image changed. This was not the area of the brain that is involved in attention.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us?\\nI believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday.\\nWithin my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’.\\nTo create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.\\nQuestion: Annie Dillard believes that\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. not enough information\\n\\nB.

In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole.  Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean.\\nThe idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.\\nNansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work.

One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts.

Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.\\n\\nParagraph: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest.

To the researchers' surprise, they failed to make contact with a group of wild parrots imported from Mexico and set free at the same time. Within 24 hours the reintroducing ended in failure, and the poor birds were back in cages, on their way to the safety of the Arizona reintroduction programme.\\nEver since then, the programme has enjoyed great success, mainly because the birds now being set free are Mexican birds illegally caught in the wild, confiscated   on arrival north of the border, and raised by their parents in the safety of the programme.

First, as the Arizona programme showed, when reintroducing parrots to the wild, we need to be aware of what the birds must know if they are to survive in their natural home.

On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO.

Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby and first released as a single on March 14, 1966 (see 1966 in music). Musically influenced by Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane, \\"Eight Miles High\\", along with its McGuinn and Crosby-penned B-side \\"Why\\", was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Accordingly, critics often cite \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era. The song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the Gavin Report regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics.\\n\\nThe master recording of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with record producer Allen Stanton guiding the band through the recording process. John Einarson has noted that the influence of Coltrane's saxophone playing and, in particular, his song \\"India\\" from the Impressions album, can be clearly heard in \\"Eight Miles High\\"--most noticeably in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. In addition to this striking guitar motif, the song is also highlighted by Chris Hillman's driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky rhythm guitar playing and the band's ethereal harmonies.  \\"Eight Miles High\\" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing. However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the sitar, despite the Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary press conference held to promote the single. In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded CD reissue of the Fifth Dimension album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him \\"feel like a plane landing.\\"  An earlier version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded with Al Schmitt at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but Columbia Records refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio.

It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied.\\nThe first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \\"Age of Fish\\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placodermi began dominating almost every known aquatic environment.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\\n\\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : So, this event requires quite a bit of background. I work as a software developer (kind of, see later), just graduated from university. Over summer last year, I worked for a small company (about 8 developers and 2 bosses/managers) doing a programming internship for three months, completely unpaid, even paying for my own transport costs. After graduating they offered me a temporary job for three months to do a short amount of work, with the possibility for extension, which I took. Importantly, my brother works there full time, which is how I got into the company. (would not recommended, not because I don't get on with *him*, as I do, but because it's hard not to worry any tension between me and other people (which I'm great at generating) won't somehow affect him)\\n\\nI have got on really well with everyone there, including the bosses, Mary and Mark. While Mary and Mark act as management and team leaders, they also do marketing, client relations, presentations etc. Basically everything the company needs that isn't programming.\\n\\nI really like everyone as people. But as coworkers, they're complete nightmares and do not get along at all. Two employee are always making snide remarks at each other under a very weak facade of \\"I'm just joking!\\" causing a lot of tension. Another employee is constantly late, delays meetings, argues with Mark and talks down to people he is supposed to be teaching. Circular arguments getting increasingly louder with immovable egos are incredibly common. Code is always written \\"my way\\" with no consistency. The bosses seem perfectly fine with all behaviour, with attempt to reprimand anyone. The way Mary handled my contract broke the law in minor ways at multiple points. Essentially, Mary and Mark seem pretty incompetent at management. It's worth mentioning the entire office is in one room so everyone can hear every conversation. Ultimately, we mutually didn't extend my contract because I did not want to work in that kind of environment. \\n\\nWhen I started I was given a pretty old laptop with a fairly damaged screen, but otherwise it did work fine. Ok, I thought, I'll just mainly use a monitor (everyone at the company has a laptop and one monitor, some people have two monitors). \\n\\nI asked Mary if there were any monitors I could use. She directed me to two old monitors, with a vga to vga cable, when my laptop only takes HDMI. I ask people if there are any vga to HDMI adapters, and they essentially say \\"there might be some around\\". The office is a complete mess with no organisation (of course), so I give up after a few minutes and buy one online. \\n\\nThe cable arrives, and the monitors don't work. I tell Mary \\"I don't think these monitors work with this laptop\\" and she agrees the monitors are kind of crappy. I take the cable home and test on my own computer, and they do work, and my work laptop does work with my brother's monitors, meaning the fault is with the old monitors. I tell Mary \\"these monitors don't work\\". I don't remember the response, but I suppose I assumed I had implied I would like a monitor.\\n\\nA week later, I mention to everyone during a team meeting, including Mary and Mark, that my monitors don't work. Nothing still happens so I think \\"fine, I'm just a temp. Maybe their budget doesn't extend that far\\" and left it, except sometimes jokingly mentioning to the others how nice it must be to have two monitors. I also mention in private to my brother how hard it is it work with no monitor, but I thought the issue was closed.\\n\\nIn their defence, I don't think I ever actually directly asked for them to buy me a new monitor, but it didn't really seem appropriate as a new employee and I wasn't really sure whether the employees bought and owned the monitors they used or if the company did (as it turned out, the company did), or what the standard procedure for well, anything was, bearing in mind this was my first professional job and I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I also didn't have any kind of \\"this is how things work here now\\" as I had gone from an intern to an employee, and it had been a year.\\n\\nI work for two months and the job I was supposed to be doing falls through and I get moved onto doing testing instead of programming, which is *not* what I agreed to, although it does say in my contract they can make me do whatever they think is appropriate. I do not like testing and am not good at it. The little bit of programming I'm expected to do is in a language I don't like and is back-end, when the original work was basically the exact opposite of these two things. I'm unable to do it and my brother has to take it from me, making me feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed. I do nothing and learn nothing for two months, making me already incredibly bitter and feel like I'm utterly wasting my time.\\n\\nDuring this time there were a few other things that made me feel undervalued and completely unwanted there. Not unwanted personally, but professionally. However, I know I can be a little paranoid, so I ignore it I put down the way I've been treated to incompetence rather than intent. It'll be over soon anyway.\\n\\nTwo months are past and I have two weeks left. A new guy, Bob, starts working there temporarily for a few months just like me, same age as me too, although he's there to help with the management side of things rather than \\"programming\\". Mark is away on business and has been for a week or so, so Mary invites Bob to sit at Mark's desk and use his monitors until he gets back. I'm a little annoyed I hadn't been asked to sit there while Mark was away but whatever, I hadn't thought of it either.\\n\\nA few days after Bob starts, Mary walks in carrying a brand new monitor in a box. Somehow, I already know what she's going to say. \\n\\n\\"Bob's new monitor has arrived!\\"\\n\\nApparently there wasn't a budget, there was just complete apathy. I'm absolutely livid. The angriest I have probably been in years. I want to fucking scream at someone, though I'm not sure what or who at. \\"But *I* wanted a monitor!\\" probably wouldn't achieve much. It's ridiculous over a fucking *monitor*, but I'm shaking with anger. It's embarrassing. Fortunately, I sit in the corner (worst spot in the office, obviously) and have my headphones in so I sit there for a bit until the conversation dies down and everyone is at their desk. I then go outside and calm down until I stop shaking. I sit back down and try to pretend everything is ok, which really, it should be, but my voice is still shaky and I'm so angry  I can't concentrate on my work for the rest of the day.\\n\\nNow, as Bob is brand new and was already using a monitor, I doubt he asked for a monitor, Mary would have bought him one.\\n\\nSomehow the conversation gets back onto monitors and I say something like \\"As Bob has a new monitor, could I have a monitor please?\\"\\n\\nMy brother responds with \\"oh, did you actually want a monitor?\\". \\n\\nAlthough it's not his responsibility to buy equipment for me, it's Mary's, this still pisses me off. I say as calmly as possible while still an irritated voice \\"*Of course* I want a monitor. I mentioned *multiple times* that the monitors you gave me don't work\\". \\n\\n\\"Oh, I didn't know that\\". Which is a blatant lie. I'm not sure how much clearer I could be than \\"these monitors don't work\\".\\n\\nMy brother gave me one of his monitors that works, but it's all a bit bittersweet. Mary still hasn't bought me a monitor.\\n\\n\\nJust to clarify, I'm not angry about Bob getting a monitor and me not, not really. I'm angry that Mary decided that Bob would get something she should have known I needed to be efficient. Someone that did not spend three months doing completely free work and someone that did not spend two weeks trying to politely prompt her. How else am I meant to feel but unwanted in that workplace?\\n\\nI'm angry at the complete apathy I feel is directed towards me, for no apparent reason. I'm angry that I'm treated like an intern not an employee. The monitor was just the final straw. If I wasn't leaving already, I would think about quitting asap.\\n\\nSo I don't think I'm an asshole for being annoyed about the monitor thing, but am I the asshole for being being entitled? Am I the asshole for being as angry as I am over something trivial? Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to communicate and then getting angry?","target":"no","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning if they are being treated unfairly by their boss.\\\\nIn the post, the author describes a situation in which their boss decides to give a new employee a monitor and does not buy one for them despite knowing that they need one.\\\\nBased on the above analysis, it seems that Mary is treating them unethically.

Evidence for the destruction originally came from a surviving letter by Pliny the Younger, who saw the eruption from a distance and described the death of his uncle Pliny the Elder, an admiral of the Roman fleet, who tried to rescue citizens. The site was lost for about 1,500 years until its initial rediscovery in 1599 and broader rediscovery almost 150 years later by Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre in 1748. The objects that lay beneath the city have been preserved for more than a millennium because of the long lack of air and moisture.

Among the casualties of this raid was the Swedish archbishop Johannes. The city remained occupied for some time, contributing to its decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century and the rise of Uppsala, Visby, Kalmar and Stockholm. The Livonian Chronicle describes the Oeselians as using two kinds of ships, the piratica and the liburna. The former was a warship, the latter mainly a merchant ship. A piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead and a rectangular sail. Viking-age treasures from Estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars.

In Italy, the term simply denotes thrillers, typically of the crime fiction, mystery, and horror subgenres, regardless of the country of origin. In English-speaking countries, however, the term \\"giallo\\" is used to refer to a particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery film which often includes elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French fantastique genre). The genre began in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined over the next few decades (although some examples continue to be produced). It has been considered to be a predecessor to, and significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.\\n\\n- Slasher films are a subgenre of horror films, typically involving a violent psychopath stalking and murdering several people, usually with bladed tools. Although the term \\"slasher\\" is sometimes used informally as a generic term for any horror movie involving murder, analysts of the genre cite an established set of characteristics which set these films apart from other horror subgenres, such as splatter films and psychological horror films.\\n\\n- The Crimson Pirate is a 1952 American Technicolor tongue-in-cheek comedy-adventure film, produced by Norman Deming and Harold Hecht, directed by Robert Siodmak, and starring Burt Lancaster, who also co-produced with Deming and Hecht. Co-starring in the film is Nick Cravat, Eva Bartok, Leslie Bradley, Torin Thatcher, and James Hayter. \\n\\n- A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).\\n\\n- Mario Bava (31 July 1914  27 April 1980) was an Italian director, screenwriter, special effects artist and cinematographer from the \\"golden age\\" of Italian horror films. His work kick-started the giallo film genre and the modern \\"slasher film\\". His son Lamberto Bava later went on to become a noted horror film director in his own right.\\n\\n- A cinematographer or director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DOP) is the chief over the camera crews working on a film, television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image. The study and practice of this field is referred to as cinematography.\\nSome filmmakers say that the cinematographer is just the chief over the camera and lighting, and the director of photography is the chief over all the photography components of film, including framing, costumes, makeup, and lighting, as well as the assistant of the post producer for color correction and grading.\\n\\n- Lamberto Bava (born 3 April 1944) is an Italian film director. Born in Rome, Bava began worked as an assistant director on the film's of his father Mario Bava. Bava co-directed the television film \\"La Venere d'Ille\\" with his father and in 1980 directed his first solo feature film \\"Macabre\\".\\n\\n- Operation Amsterdam is a 1959 British action film, directed by Michael McCarthy, and featuring Peter Finch, Eva Bartok and Tony Britton. It is based on a true story as described in the book \\"Adventure in Diamonds\\", by David E Walker. The action of the story covers a few days in May 1940 when the Germans invaded the Netherlands. The composer Philip Green composed two original pieces of music for the film, the \\"Pierement Waltz\\" and the \\"Amsterdam Polka\\".\\n\\n- A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\\n\\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\\n\\n- A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation.\\n\\n- Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature.\\nIn the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.\\n\\n- Eva Bartok (18 June 19271 August 1998), was an actress born in Budapest, Hungary as Éva Márta Szke Ivanovics. She began acting in films in 1950 and her last credited appearance was in 1966. She is best known for appearances in \\"Blood and Black Lace\\", \\"The Crimson Pirate\\", \\"Operation Amsterdam\\", and \\"Ten Thousand Bedrooms\\".\\n\\n- A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.\\n\\n- A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay.\\n\\n- Blood and Black Lace ( Italian : Sei donne per l'assassino ; also known as Six Women for the Murderer ) is a 1964 Italian horror thriller film directed by Mario Bava .

The story concerns the stalking and brutal murders of various scantily - clad fashion models , committed by a masked killer in a desperate attempt to obtain a scandal - revealing diary . The film is generally considered one of the earliest and most influential of all giallo films and served as a stylistic template for the \`\` body count '' slasher films of the 1980s . Tim Lucas has noted that the film has \`\` gone on to inspire legions of contemporary filmmakers , from Dario Argento to Martin Scorsese to Quentin Tarantino . '' In 2004 , one of its sequences was voted No. 85 in \`\` The 100 Scariest Movie Moments '' by the Bravo TV network .\\n\\n- A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\\n\\n- Marcello Fondato (8 January 1924  13 November 2008) was an Italian screenwriter and film director.

The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than $450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The $175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied. Funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective orders remains in place, said Milne and Stewart Ralphs, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake.

It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about .\\n\\n- The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. A country scores higher HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, the GDP per capita is higher, the fertility rate is lower, and the inflation rate is lower. The HDI was developed by the Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq working alongside Indian economist Amartya Sen, often framed in terms of whether people are able to \\"be\\" and \\"do\\" desirable things in their life, and was published by the United Nations Development Programme.\\n\\n- Welschriesling ( also known as Laški Rizling , Olasz Riesling and Graševina ) is a white wine grape variety , unrelated to the Rhine Riesling , that is grown throughout Central Europe .\\n\\n- Chardonnay is a green-skinned grape variety used in the production of white wine. The variety originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is produced, from England to New Zealand. For new and developing wine regions, growing Chardonnay is seen as a \\"rite of passage\\" and an easy entry into the international wine market.\\n\\n- Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.\\n\\n- Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are \\"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\\". A related United Nations paper adds that \\"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\\".\\n\\n- Centrope is an Interreg IIIA project to establish a multinational region in the Central Europe encompassing four European countries: Slovakia, Austria, Hungary and Czech Republic.\\n\\n- Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and \\"green flavors\\" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risk losing a lot of aromatics from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes.\\n\\n- Cultural identity is the identity or feeling of belonging to a group. It is part of a person's self-conception and self-perception and is related to nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class, generation, locality or any kind of social group that has its own distinct culture. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the individual but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity.\\n\\n- Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.\\n\\n- A varietal wine is a wine made primarily from a single named grape variety, and which typically displays the name of that variety on the wine label. Examples of grape varieties commonly used in varietal wines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Merlot. Wines that display the name of two or more varieties on their label, such as a Chardonnay-Viognier, are blends and not varietal wines. The term is frequently misused in place of vine variety; the term variety refers to the vine or grape while varietal refers to the wine produced by a variety.\\n\\n- White wine is a wine whose color can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold coloured.\\n\\n- Western Europe, also West Europe, is the region comprising the western part of the European continent. There may be differences between the geopolitical and purely geographic definitions of the term.\\n\\n- Riesling is a white grape variety which originated in the Rhine region of Germany. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines. Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. As of 2004, Riesling was estimated to be the world's 20th most grown variety at (with an increasing trend), but in terms of importance for quality wines, it is usually included in the \\"top three\\" white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Riesling is a variety which is highly \\"\\"terroir\\"-expressive\\", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is greatly influenced by the wine's place of origin.\\n\\n- Terroir (from \\"terre\\", \\"land\\") is the set of all environmental factors that affect a crop's phenotype, unique environment contexts and farming practices, when the crop is grown in a specific habitat.

Passage:Truman had acceded to the presidency in April 1945 after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Defeating attempts to drop him from the ticket, Truman won the presidential nomination at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. The Democratic convention's civil rights plank caused a walk-out by several Southern delegates, who launched a third-party \\"Dixiecrat\\" ticket led by Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. The Dixiecrats hoped to win enough electoral votes to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, where they could extract concessions from either Dewey or Truman in exchange for their support. Truman also faced a challenge from the left in the form of former Vice President Henry A. Wallace, who launched the Progressive Party and challenged Truman's confrontational Cold War policies. Dewey, who was the leader of his party's moderate eastern wing and had been the 1944 Republican presidential nominee, defeated Senator Robert A. Taft and other challengers at the 1948 Republican National Convention.","target":"b","rationale":"The question only asks for the name of the party that controlled the legislative branch of government, which is mentioned directly in the passage as \\"Truman\\".

In his youth, he received a thorough musical education from his father. He wrote his first composition at the age of six, and continued to write music almost until his death.  During his boyhood Strauss attended orchestra rehearsals of the Munich Court Orchestra (now the Bavarian State Orchestra), where he received private instruction in music theory and orchestration from an assistant conductor. In 1872, he started receiving violin instruction at the Royal School of Music from Benno Walter, his father's cousin. In 1874, Strauss heard his first Wagner operas, Lohengrin and Tannhauser. The influence of Wagner's music on Strauss's style was to be profound, but at first his musically conservative father forbade him to study it. Indeed, in the Strauss household, the music of Richard Wagner was viewed with deep suspicion, and it was not until the age of 16 that Strauss was able to obtain a score of Tristan und Isolde. In later life, Strauss said that he deeply regretted the conservative hostility to Wagner's progressive works. Nevertheless, Strauss's father undoubtedly had a crucial influence on his son's developing taste, not least in Strauss's abiding love for the horn.  In early 1882, in Vienna, he gave the first performance of his Violin Concerto in D minor, playing a piano reduction of the orchestral part himself, with his teacher Benno Walter as soloist. The same year he entered Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he studied philosophy and art history, but not music. He left a year later to go to Berlin, where he studied briefly before securing a post as assistant conductor to Hans von Bulow, who had been enormously impressed by the young composer's Serenade for wind instruments, composed when he was only 16 years of age. Strauss learned the art of conducting by observing Bulow in rehearsal. Bulow was very fond of the young man, and decided that Strauss should be his successor as conductor of the Meiningen Court Orchestra when Bulow resigned in 1885. Strauss's compositions at this time were indebted to the style of Robert Schumann or Felix Mendelssohn, true to his father's teachings. His Horn Concerto No. 1, Op. 11, is representative of this period and is a staple of the modern horn repertoire.  Strauss married soprano Pauline de Ahna on 10 September 1894. She was famous for being irascible, garrulous, eccentric and outspoken, but to all appearances the marriage was essentially happy, and she was a great source of inspiration to him. Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final Four Last Songs of 1948, he preferred the soprano voice to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles.  The Strausses had one son, Franz, in 1897. Franz married Alice von Grab-Hermannsworth, daughter of a Jewish industrialist, in a Roman Catholic ceremony in 1924. Franz and Alice had two sons, Richard and Christian.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Where was Strauss born?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"in Munich,","rationale":"The context above states that Strauss was born in Munich, and the birthdate provided is 11 June 1864.

It is a branch of malacology . Those that study teuthology are known as teuthologists .\\n\\n- Malacology is the branch of invertebrate zoology that deals with the study of the Mollusca (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest phylum of animals in terms of described species after the arthropods. Mollusks include snails and slugs, clams, octopus and squid, and numerous other kinds, many (but by no means all) of which have shells. One division of malacology, conchology, is devoted to the study of mollusk shells. Malacology derives from Greek , \\"malakos\\", \\"soft\\"; and , \\"-logia\\".\\n\\n- Zoology (UK: , zoo-OL-luh-jee; US: , zoh-OL-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , \\"zion\\", i.e. \\"animal\\" and , \\"logos\\", i.e. \\"knowledge, study\\".\\n\\n- Snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name \\"snail\\" is also applied to most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word \\"snail\\" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also thousands of species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Occasionally a few other molluscs that are not actually gastropods, such as the Monoplacophora, which superficially resemble small limpets, may also informally be referred to as \\"snails\\".\\n\\n- An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. \\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.\\n\\n- Clam is the general common name of any mollusks within the class Bivalvia. More specifically, true clams are bivalves having two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and having a powerful burrowing foot. They are infaunal, spending most of their lives partially buried in the sand of the ocean floor. These characteristics distinguish the true clams from other bivalves, such as oysters, mussels, and scallops.\\n\\n- Slug, or land slug, is a common name for any apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word \\"slug\\" is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly sea slugs and semislugs (this is in contrast to the common name \\"snail\\", which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell).\\n\\n- Conchology (from \\"konkhos\\", \\"cockle\\") is the study of mollusc shells. Conchology is one aspect of malacology, the study of molluscs; however, malacology is the study of molluscs as whole organisms, whereas conchology is confined to the study of their shells. It includes the study of land and freshwater mollusc shells as well as seashells and extends to the study of a gastropod's operculum.\\n\\n- A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.\\n\\n- In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.\\n\\n- In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.\\n\\n- The molluscs (or mollusks ) compose the large phylum of invertebrate animals known as the Mollusca. Around 85,000 extant species of molluscs are recognized. Molluscs are the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebratesand either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total. The scientific study of molluscs is called malacology.\\n\\n- Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'field of work' with the subject 'teuthology'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- animal\\n - biology\\n - botany\\n - cephalopoda\\n - class\\n - malacology\\n - research\\n - vertebrata\\n - zoology","target":"cephalopoda","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"cephalopoda\\"."},{"source":"Sentence: \\"John read the book loudly.\\"\\nPick from options: would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- unacceptable\\n- acceptable...I think the answer is","target":"acceptable","rationale":"The sentence \\"John read the book loudly\\" is acceptable.

Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which student knew more about Hydrothermal vents?","target":"Bobby","rationale":"The background information for this question mentions that hydrothermal vents are common at seafloor spreading centers.

However, Flight Navigator Lieutenant Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson), and Pilot Lieutenant Jeremy Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are assigned a reconnaissance mission over Bosnia.

A prospective case series involving 79 NSCLC patients who were enrolled in clinical trials undergoing chemotherapy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, between April 1 and July 15, 2003, was studied. Whether or not there existed a delay, omission, or refusal of scheduled chemotherapy, was recorded. Whether or not our patients had been suspected of or treated as having SARS, was recorded. The patients filled out questionnaires regarding lung cancer treatment and the risk of getting SARS from the hospital. Among these patients, five were placed in an isolation unit to rule out SARS infection during this period of time, and no patient was documented to have suffered from a SARS infection after examinations. Of 373 scheduled chemotherapy injections in 79 patients, a delay in treatment occurred only 10 times. Three patients refused further chemotherapy because of a fear of getting SARS if they visited the hospital. Fifty-eight patients responded to our questionnaires. Thirty-seven patients (63.8%) were afraid of visiting hospital during this SARS infection period. Twenty-one patients (36.2%) felt that a SARS infection was more severe and fatal than their lung cancer. In conclusion, SARS is a new disease entity that is highly contagious. Its clinical manifestations overlap with the signs and symptoms of lung cancer. Thus, a clear differentiation between the two conditions is needed, especially for those patients who are under active anti-cancer treatment.","target":"Impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome on the status of lung cancer chemotherapy patients and a correlation of the signs and symptoms","rationale":"This study aims to describe the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the status and chemotherapy of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had entered clinical trials, and to review how to differentiate the signs and symptoms of SARS from lung cancer and its treatment-related toxicities.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward.

Whereas today it is surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula was surrounded by a fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.Neanderthals are known to have lived in caves around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was excavated at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.More Neanderthal remains have been found elsewhere on the Rock at Devil's Tower and in Ibex, Vanguard and Gorham's Caves on the east side of Gibraltar. Excavations in Gorham's Cave have found evidence of Neanderthal occupation dated as recently as 28,000–24,000 years ago, well after they were believed to have died out elsewhere in Europe. The caves of Gibraltar continued to be used by Homo sapiens after the final extinction of the Neanderthals. Stone tools, ancient hearths and animal bones dating from around 40,000 years ago to about 5,000 years ago have been found in deposits left in Gorham's Cave. Numerous potsherds dating from the Neolithic period have been found in Gibraltar's caves, mostly of types typical of the Almerian culture found elsewhere in Andalusia, especially around the town of Almería, from which it takes its name.

For example, if an algorithm classifies a given pathology image to be a malignant tumor, then the doctor may need to know which parts of the image led the algorithm to this classification. How to interpret black-box predictors is thus an important and active area of research.   A fundamental question is: how much can we trust the interpretation itself? In this paper, we show that interpretation of deep learning predictions is extremely fragile in the following sense:  two perceptively indistinguishable inputs with the same predicted label can be assigned very different}interpretations. We systematically characterize the fragility of the interpretations generated by several widely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, integrated gradient, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that even small random perturbation can change the feature importance and new systematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations without changing the label. We extend these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly fragile. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on why fragility could be a fundamental challenge to the current interpretation approaches.","target":"Can we trust a neural network's explanation for its prediction?

However, recognition of eosinophiluria by Wright's staining is technically difficult, and the spectrum of disorders causing eosinophiluria is not completely defined. We have adapted Hansel's stain for the examination of urinary sediment. Whereas there was a variable uptake of Wright's stain by eosinophils in the urine, such eosinophils were readily recognized with Hansel's stain by the presence of bright red granules. The prevalence of eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis was 10 of 11 patients, in acute tubular necrosis none of 30, in acute pyelonephritis none of 10, in acute cystitis 1 of 15, in postinfectious glomerulonephritis 1 of 6, in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis 4 of 10, and in acute prostatitis 6 of 10. Eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis was demonstrated by Hansel's stain in 10 of 11 patients but by Wright's stain in only 2 of 11 patients. We conclude that Hansel's stain substantially improves the recognition of eosinophiluria as compared with Wright's stain. Eosinophiluria is useful in distinguishing acute interstitial nephritis from acute tubular necrosis.

He was victorious at least once at the City Dionysia , first probably in the mid- 440s ( IG II2 2325 . 56 ; the fourth entry after Teleclides and three poets whose names have been lost , and just before Hermippus ) , and twice at the Lenaia , first probably in the mid- to late 430s ( IG II2 2325 . 122 ; just after Cratinus and just before Hermippus ) . He was especially famous for his inventive imagination , and the elegance and purity of his diction are attested by the epithet  ( most Attic ) applied to him by Athenaeus and the sophist Phrynichus . He was the inventor of a new meter , called after him , the Pherecratean , which frequently occurs in the choruses of Greek tragedies and in Horace . According to an anonymous essay on tragedy , Pherecrates wrote 18 plays , suggesting that one or more of the 19 surviving titles must be eliminated somehow ( i.e. by assigning the play to another author who wrote a comedy by the same name , and assuming an ancient scholarly error , or by identifying e.g. The Human Heracles and The Fake Heracles as a single play with multiple titles ) .\\n\\n- Aristophanes (or  ; c. 446  c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it.\\n\\n- Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes  whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis.\\n\\n- A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.\\n\\n- In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries.\\n\\n- Hermippus (fl. 5th century BC) was the one-eyed Athenian writer of the Old Comedy who flourished during the Peloponnesian War. \\nLife.\\nHe was the son of Lysis, and the brother of the comic poet Myrtilus. He was younger than Telecleides and older than Eupolis and Aristophanes. According to the Suda, he wrote forty plays, and his chief actor was Simeron, according to the scholiast of Aristophanes. The titles and fragments of nine of his plays are preserved. He was a bitter opponent of Pericles, whom he accused (probably in the \\"Moirai\\") of being a bully and a coward, and of carousing with his boon companions while the Lacedaemonians were invading Attica. He also accused Aspasia of impiety and offences against morality, and her acquittal was only secured by the tears of Pericles (Plutarch, \\"Pericles\\", 32). In the \\"Female Bread-Sellers\\", he attacked the demagogue Hyperbolus. The \\"Mat-Carriers\\" contains many parodies of Homer.\\n\\n- Lysistrata (or ; Attic Greek: , \\"Army Disbander\\") is a comedy by Aristophanes. Originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BC, it is a comic account of one woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peacea strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career. It was produced in the same year as the \\"Thesmophoriazusae\\", another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition.\\n\\n- The Clouds (\\"Nephelai\\") is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes. A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens, it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423BC and was not as well-received as the author had hoped, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year. It was revised between 420 and 417BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form.\\n\\n- Ancient Greek comedy was one of the final three principal dramatic forms in the theatre of classical Greece (the others being tragedy and the satyr play). Athenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods: Old Comedy, Middle Comedy, and New Comedy. Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, while Middle Comedy is largely lost, i.e. preserved only in relatively short fragments by authors such as Athenaeus of Naucratis. New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of Menander. \\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'pherecrates' with the relationship of 'country of citizenship'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- athens\\n - attica\\n - classical athens\\n - greece\\n - writer","target":"classical athens","rationale":"The context of the question mentions that Pherecrates was a Greek poet who lived in Classical Athens.

His father's (Ai Qing) original surname was written Jiang (Jiang ). Ai collaborated with Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron as the artistic consultant on the Beijing National Stadium for the 2008 Olympics.\\n\\nIn June 2011, the Beijing Local Taxation Bureau demanded a total of over 12 million yuan (US$1.85 million) from Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. in unpaid taxes and fines, and accorded three days to appeal the demand in writing. According to Ai's wife, Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. has hired two Beijing lawyers as defense attorneys. Ai's family state that Ai is \\"neither the chief executive nor the legal representative of the design company, which is registered in his wife's name.\\"  Offers of donations poured in from Ai's fans across the world when the fine was announced. Eventually an online loan campaign was initiated on 4 November 2011, and close to 9 million RMB was collected within ten days, from 30,000 contributions. Notes were folded into paper planes and thrown over the studio walls, and donations were made in symbolic amounts such as 8964 (4 June 1989, Tiananmen Massacre) or 512 (12 May 2008, Sichuan earthquake). To thank creditors and acknowledge the contributions as loans, Ai designed and issued loan receipts to all who participated in the campaign. Funds raised from the campaign were used as collateral, required by law for an appeal on the tax case. Lawyers acting for Ai submitted an appeal against the fine in January 2012; the Chinese government subsequently agreed to conduct a review.  In June 2012, the court heard the tax appeal case. Ai's wife, Lu Qing, the legal representative of the design company, attended the hearing. Lu was accompanied by several lawyers and an accountant, but the witnesses they had requested to testify, including Ai, were prevented from attending a court hearing. Ai asserts that the entire matter - including the 81 days he spent in jail in 2011 - is intended to suppress his provocations. Ai said he had no illusions as to how the case would turn out, as he believes the court will protect the government's own interests. On 20 June, hundreds of Ai's supporters gathered outside the Chaoyang District Court in Beijing despite a small army of police officers, some of whom videotaped the crowd and led several people away. On 20 July, Ai's tax appeal was rejected in court. The same day Ai's studio released \\"The Fake Case\\" which tracks the status and history of this case including a timeline and the release of official documents. On 27 September, the court upheld the 2.4 million tax evasion fine. Ai had previously deposited 1.33 million in a government-controlled account in order to appeal. Ai said he will not pay the remainder because he does not recognize the charge.  In October 2012, authorities revoked the license of Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. for failing to re-register, an annual requirement by the administration.

Their replication complexes are commonly associated with modified host cell membranes. Membrane structures supporting viral RNA synthesis range from distinct spherular membrane invaginations to more elaborate webs of packed membranes and vesicles. Generally, their ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and exact role in viral replication remain to be defined. Poorly characterized double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) were previously implicated in SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. We have now applied electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells for the three-dimensional imaging of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. Our analysis defines a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that integrates convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected DMVs (diameter 200-300 nm), and ''vesicle packets'' apparently arising from DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were most abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits. However, double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior. Since we could not discern a connection between DMV interior and cytosol, our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. Our data document the extensive virusinduced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network that is used to organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms. Together with biochemical studies of the viral enzyme complex, our ultrastructural description of this ''replication network'' will aid to further dissect the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its virus-host interactions.

Ham's F-10 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) without protein supplementation supported growth of the 2-cell embryos to blastocysts. Addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA), fetal cord serum (FCS), or maternal serum (MS) did not enhance or reduce the blastulation rates (medium alone, 89.4%; BSA, 86.4%; FCS, 90%; MS, 74.7%). Unsupplemented Ham's F-10 medium was found to contain three major peaks of approximately 50,000 daltons and several minor peaks, analyzed on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sodium sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), suggesting the presence of protein(s) in the medium itself. The storing of medium up to 425 days at 4 degrees C affected neither the HPLC profile nor its ability to support embryo growth (blastulation rates: fresh, 84%; stored 150 to 425 days, 77.7%).

In the present study, other peripheral blood cell types were examined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry for the presence of C3dg binding activity. Specific uptake of C3dg occurred with neutrophils, platelets, and B lymphocytes, but not with eosinophils or T lymphocytes. Monocytes, contained within a mixed cell population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and platelets, also bound C3dg, whereas purified monocytes did not. Binding of 125I-labeled glutaraldehyde-cross-linked C3dg to platelets was saturable, with an average of 1940 C3dg molecules bound per platelet at saturation (n = 8), ranging in number from 660 to 3930 molecules bound. Activation of platelets with thrombin did not consistently cause an increase in the expression of CR4 sites. 125I-C3dg binding to platelets was competitively inhibited equally well by unlabeled C3dg and iC3b, and approximately fourfold less well by C3b. The addition of platelets to elutriated monocytes generated C3dg binding activity on these cells by the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes. Thus, the CR4 on platelets accounted for the C3dg binding activity initially observed with partially purified monocytes. The adherent property of platelets may enable them to confer on certain other cell types the ability to localize C3dg-coated immune complexes or particles. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Cellular distribution of complement receptor type 4 (CR4): expression on human platelets. option2: Reproductive failure in common seals feeding on fish from polluted coastal waters [published erratum appears in Nature 1986 Dec 4-10;324(6096):418]","target":"Cellular distribution of complement receptor type 4 (CR4): expression on human platelets","rationale":"The abstract describes the cellular distribution of complement receptor type 4 (CR4) on human platelets and its implications for immune responses.

She said Lee County residents began calling the utility saying they heard on the station that county water was unsafe and should not be used for drinking, showering or for any use. DiPiero stressed in an email to media outlets that the utility was not having any issues with the water supply and the water is safe to use. However, some people believed the hoax, at least for a short time. One woman wrote in saying she worked in the food service industry and was trying to figure out how to serve customers and prepare food without requiring water.https://www.snopes.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=30094&action=edit#  Lee County residents were far from the first people to fall for this venerable jape. Back in September 2007, for example, news media reported that a New Zealand MP was tricked by a letter from a constituent asking her to raise the issue of “dihydrogen monoxide” (DHMO):  National MP Jacqui Dean has been caught out by a long-running hoax that seeks to trick gullible MPs into calling for a ban on “dihydrogen monoxide” — or water. A letter, signed by Ms Dean and sent to Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton, the minister in charge of drug policy, asked if the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs had a view on banning the “drug”. Mr Anderton yesterday took the opportunity to rub Ms Dean’s nose in the embarrassing blunder. He said dihydrogen monoxide “may have been described to her as colourless, odourless, tasteless and causing the death of uncounted thousands of people every year, and withdrawal from which, for those who become dependent on it, means certain death. “I had to respond that the experts had no intention of doing so.”  In 1997, Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student at Eagle Rock Junior High School in Idaho Falls, made the news when he based his science fair project on a warning similar to the one reproduced in the “Example” box above. Zohner’s project, titled “How Gullible Are We?”, involved presenting that warning about “the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide” to fifty ninth-grade students and asking them what (if anything) should be done about the chemical:  Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.Dihydrogen monoxide: Contamination is reaching epidemic proportions! Quantities of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every stream, lake, and reservoir in America today. But the pollution is global, and the contaminant has even been found in Antarctic ice. DHMO has caused millions of dollars of property damage in the midwest, and recently California. Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used: Companies dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can be done to stop them because this practice is still legal. The impact on wildlife is extreme, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer! The American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its “importance to the economic health of this nation.” In fact, the navy and other military organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and designing multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it during warfare situations. Hundreds of military research facilities receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated underground distribution network. Many store large quantities for later use. Forty-three students favored banning DHMO, six were undecided, and only one correctly recognized that ‘dihydrogen monoxide’ was actually plain old water. Zohner’s analysis of the results he obtained won him first prize in the Greater Idaho Falls Science Fair; garnered him scads of attention from newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations, universities, and congresspeople; and prompted the usual round of outcries about how our ignorant citizenry doesn’t read critically and can be easily misled. Even back then Nathan Zohner’s project wasn’t original, as spoof petitions about dihydrogen monoxide and other innocuous “dangers” had been circulating for years, and Nathan based his project on a bogus report that was already making the rounds of the Internet. Moreover, his target audience was ninth-graders, a group highly susceptible to allowing peer pressure to overwhelm critical thinking. Thrust any piece of paper at the average high school student with a suggestion about what the “correct” response to it should be, and peer pressure pretty much assures you’ll get the answer you’re looking for. Someone that age isn’t very likely to read a friend’s petition calling for the banning of whale hunting and critically evaluate the socio-economic and environmental impact of such a regulation; instead, he’s probably going to say to himself, “This issue is obviously important to my friend, and he must have some good reasons for circulating the petition, so I’ll sign it.” That said, this example does aptly demonstrate the kind of fallacious reasoning that’s thrust at us every day under the guise of “important information”: how with a little effort, even the most innocuous of substances can be made to sound like a dangerous threat to human life. In March 2004 the California municipality of Aliso Viejo (a suburb in Orange County) came within a cat’s whisker of falling for this hoax after a paralegal there convinced city officials of the danger posed by this chemical. The leg-pull got so far as a vote’s having been scheduled for the City Council on a proposed law that would have banned the use of foam containers at city-sponsored events because (among other things) they were made with DHMO, a substance that could “threaten human health and safety.” Claim: Dihydrogen monoxide is a dangerous chemical that should be banned.","target":"0","rationale":"The passage describes a series of studies that investigate the effects of various manipulations on attentional set-shifting in rats, but it does not state a specific research question or hypothesis that the studies are designed to test.

Here we show that transient promotion of cell survival through expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 enables EpiSCs and Sox17+ endoderm progenitors to integrate into blastocysts and contribute to chimeric embryos. Upon injection into blastocyst, BCL2-expressing EpiSCs contributed to all bodily tissues in chimeric animals while Sox17+ endoderm progenitors specifically contributed in a region-specific fashion to endodermal tissues. In addition, BCL2 expression enabled rat EpiSCs to contribute to mouse embryonic chimeras, thereby forming interspecies chimeras that could survive to adulthood. Our system therefore provides a method to overcome cellular compatibility issues that typically restrict chimera formation. Application of this type of approach could broaden the use of embryonic chimeras, including region-specific chimeras, for basic developmental biology research and regenerative medicine.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract is organized into three paragraphs.

It was written between 1940 and 1943. The title was inspired by the French classical liberal thinker Alexis de Tocqueville's writings on the \\"road to servitude.\\" It was first published in Britain by Routledge in March 1944 and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it \\"that unobtainable book,\\" also due in part to wartime paper rationing. When it was published in the United States by the University of Chicago in September of that year, it achieved greater popularity than in Britain. At the arrangement of editor Max Eastman, the American magazine Reader's Digest also published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling The Road to Serfdom to reach a far wider audience than academics.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US.

We formally define the notion of incremental learning dynamics and derive the conditions on depth and initialization for which this phenomenon arises in deep linear models. Our main theoretical contribution is a dynamical depth separation result, proving that while shallow models can exhibit incremental learning dynamics, they require the initialization to be exponentially small for these dynamics to present themselves. However, once the model becomes deeper, the dependence becomes polynomial and incremental learning can arise in more natural settings.

Both the Danes and Mansfelt were defeated in 1626, and the Catholic League occupied the northern German lands that had hitherto acted as a buffer zone for the Republic. For a while in 1628 an invasion of the eastern part of the Republic seemed imminent. However, the relative might of Spain, the main player up to now in the German civil war, was ebbing fast. By April 1629 the States Army counted 77,000 soldiers, half as much again as the Army of Flanders at that point in time. This allowed Frederick Henry to raise a mobile army of 28,000  and invest 's-Hertogenbosch. During the siege of this strategic fortress city the imperialist and Spanish allies launched a diversionary attack from Germany's IJssel line. After crossing this river, they invaded the Dutch heartland, getting as far as the city of Amersfoort, which promptly surrendered. The States General, however, mobilised civic militias and scrounged garrison troops from fortresses all around the country, assembling an army that at the height of the emergency numbered no less than 128,000 troops. This enabled Frederick Henry to maintain his siege of 's-Hertogenbosch. When Dutch troops surprised the Spanish fortress of Wesel, which acted as the principal Spanish supply base, this forced the invaders to retreat to the IJssel.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of ED adult patients before, during and after the SARS epidemic in a SARS-dedicated hospital. Methods: A retrospective, ED chart review was conducted, and demographic data were obtained from a computer database, for a total of 17,586 patients. Patient information, including age, gender, mode of arrival, triage category, time of visit, main diagnosis, use of ED services, and status after the ED visit, were collected and compared for pre-, early-, peak-, late-, and post-SARS epidemic stages. Results: Demographic data demonstrated a significant decrease in patient attendances per day, with a mean reduction of 92.5 8.3 patients (43.7 3.9% reduction in rate; p < 0.01) during peak-versus pre-epidemic stages, but revealed no differences in patient age and gender. The numbers of patients with ambulance transport, inter-hospital referral, and critical illnesses, including DOA, categorized as triage 1, or admitted to a ward or intensive care unit after the ED visit, were not influenced by the SARS epidemic. The number of patients with upper airway infections and suicide attempts from drug overdoses increased, but not statistically significantly. The number of patients with other diagnoses decreased progressively from early-to peak-epidemic stages, but returned to their earlier levels at the post-epidemic stage. Statistically significant decreases (p < 0.05) were noted in mean attendance at peakversus pre-and early-epidemic stages for patients with cardiovascular disease, inflammatory or functional bowel disease, endocrine disease, dizziness or vertigo, or trauma. Conclusion: The SARS outbreak did not eliminate the need of critically ill patients for advanced medical support. However, besides an overall decrease in patient numbers, the SARS epidemic markedly altered demographic information, clinical characteristics, and the use of medical services by adult patients in the ED of a SARS-dedicated hospital.

Selection of patients was made from among 206 cases of severe disease. Twenty-four patients (36%) sustained remission for at least 5 yr (mean, 11 +/- 0.6 yr) after initial therapy, and 42 (64%) relapsed and were retreated. Patients who sustained remission had shorter durations of illness before therapy (8 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 2 mo, p less than 0.05) and they had greater laboratory improvements during treatment. The frequencies of cirrhosis and death were not significantly greater in patients who relapsed. Of the 42 patients who relapsed, 9 (21%) ultimately entered a sustained remission after retreatment. Remission for at least 5 yr was possible in 33 of the 66 patients (50%). Major drug complications developed more commonly in those who relapsed and required retreatment (59% vs. 29%, p less than 0.05). We conclude that 50% of patients who enter remission during initial therapy may ultimately achieve a sustained remission, especially if their disease is of short duration and adequately suppressed during treatment.

When the morphological transitions are initiated by a temperature shift from 25 degrees to 37 degrees C, all three strains undergo similar physiological changes, but these are less severe in G184A and G222B than in the Downs strain. The transitions from mycelial to yeast morphology in both of the more virulent strains are also one-third more rapid than in Downs. We also find that the differences in temperature sensitivity of the three strains can be correlated with the temperature required for complete uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The differences in sensitivity to elevated temperatures extend to the growth of yeast cells of all three strains. Considered together, our results suggest that sensitivity to elevated temperatures may be a key factor accounting for differences in virulence and that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation may be the primary event in the morphological transition in all three strains.","target":"Adenosine Triphosphate","rationale":"The abstract states that oxidative phosphorylation is an important mechanism underlying the mycelial-to-yeast transition in Histoplasma capsulatum.

He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia.\\nThe laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed.\\nThese special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term.\\nAnother idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them.

Aside from this difference, the overall health of Jeremy and Brenda was similar.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication.

The second track on the band's 1984 album, The Unforgettable Fire, it was released as the album's lead single in September 1984. Written about Martin Luther King Jr., the song received mixed critical reviews at the time, but it was a major commercial success for the band and has since become one of the band's most popular songs. \\"Pride\\" appeared on the compilation\\n\\nThe melody and the chords were worked up in a November 1983 War Tour sound check in Hawaii and completed in Windmill Lane Studios during The Unforgettable Fire recording sessions. The guitar part is subtly varied through each verse, chorus, and melody, such that no riff is exactly repeated.  The song had been intended to be based on Ronald Reagan's pride in America's military power, but Stephen B. Oates's book Let The Trumpet Sound: A Life of Martin Luther King, Jr. and a biography of Malcolm X caused the lyricist Bono to ponder the different sides of the civil rights campaigns, the violent and the non-violent. In subsequent years, Bono has expressed his dissatisfaction with the lyrics, which he describes, along with another Unforgettable Fire song \\"Bad\\", as being \\"left as simple sketches\\". He says that he was swayed by the Edge and producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who played down the need to develop the lyrics as they thought their impressionistic nature would give added forcefulness to the song's feeling, particularly when heard by non-English speakers. In U2 by U2, Bono said: \\"I looked at how glorious that song was and thought: 'What the fuck is that all about?' It's just a load of vowel sounds ganging up on a great man. It is emotionally very articulate - if you didn't speak English.\\"  The song contains the erroneous reference to King's shooting as \\"Early morning, April 4,\\" when it actually occurred after 6 p.m. Bono acknowledges the error and in live performances he occasionally changes the lyric to \\"Early evening...\\"  Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders sang backing vocals on the recording.

After signing the Maastricht Treaty, Greece applied to join the eurozone. The two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3% of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60% of GDP. Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account. On 1 January 2001, Greece joined the eurozone, with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1. However, in 2001 the euro only existed electronically, so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002. This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro, which ended on 1 March 2012.","target":"1832","rationale":"The main idea of the context is about drachma.
