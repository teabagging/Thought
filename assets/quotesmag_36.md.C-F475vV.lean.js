I’m in my last year now. A couple of days ago, my sister also moved back with plans to start grad school in the fall. So...it’s a little crowded. My sister rented a uhaul for her stuff and had it parked in front of the house. My mom and I took it back yesterday, with my mom driving the truck and me following behind in my car. Then, we drove back home together.\\n\\nMy family and I live in a row house. There’s a parking spot right in front of the house, and another one down the street. Those spots are where my parents park, and I usually park on the street. So I’m driving my mom home and I go to park where I usually park, and she tells me to just park in the spot in front of the house. I kind of protest, because I don’t want to have to move my car later, and tell her I’ll just drop her off in front of the house and then go park on the street. At this point she gets a little irritated with me and tells me to just park in front of the house and leave it alone. I’m like, fine, whatever, not a big deal. \\n\\nLater that day my dad comes home and asks why I’m parked in front of the house. I told him what happened with my mom. I can tell he’s kind of annoyed that I parked there, but I don’t think it’s a big deal so I just brush it off. \\n\\nNow today, I have the day off and I’m just hanging out at home. I go to the basement and am working out on the treadmill when my dad comes down the stairs. He says: “hey, so your mother and I had a discussion about the parking spot and it’s okay if you move your car”. Now at this point I’m irritated. I said something along the lines of “what are you talking about? I know I’m ALLOWED to move my car, all I said is that I parked there because mom told me to and I didn’t feel like arguing with her!” Now I know I kind of blew up here, but I was annoyed because  i could tell he just wanted me to move my car and I don’t like when people beat around the bush. \\n\\nI finished my workout, took a shower, then I’m just in the living room when here comes my dad again. He looks at me and says “you know, whatever issues your mother and I are having with the parking spot, you don’t have to get into the middle of them”.\\n\\nSo now I’m furious. I tell him “I have no idea what you’re talking about! If you want me to move my car, just ask me to!” And he just walks away.\\n\\nSo I’ve decided I’m not moving the car unless he explicitly asks me to. It’s now apparent to me that my mom told me to park in the spot to piss off my dad. But honestly that’s none of my business and I had no idea when I parked in the spot. I just want to get my degree and move out, I have no interest in being involved in my parents marital drama.\\n\\nSo, am I the asshole for not moving my car (even though it seems obvious my dad wants me to) because he won’t ask?","target":"HISTORICAL","rationale":"The author uses the past tense to describe events that have already occurred.

Iron deficiency is associated with reversible abnormalities of immune function, but it is difficult to demonstrate the severity and relevance of these in observational studies. Iron treatment has been associated with acute exacerbations of infection, in particular, malaria. Iron and the immune system. Ward RJ(1), Crichton RR, Taylor DL, Della Corte L, Srai SK, Dexter DT. Author information: (1)Biologie du Comportement, Universite Catholique de Louvain, 1348, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. roberta.ward@uclouvain.be In vitro studies of iron deficiency and functional immunity. Two component systems of active immunity—humoral and cell-mediated immunity—have been studied extensively, mainly in vitro, in relation to iron deficiency in both humans and animals. Iron is a mineral that plays an important role in immune function. A diet containing too little iron can contribute to anemia and weaken the immune system (1, 2, 3, 4). That's why it's important to optimize your intake of iron-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, legumes, nuts, seeds, cruciferous vegetables and dried fruit. In addition, lymphocytes play an important role in adaptive immunity. Thirdly, a variety of effector molecules, e.g. toll-like receptors, NF-κB, hypoxia factor-1, haem oxygenase, will orchestrate the inflammatory response by mobilising a variety of cytokines, neurotrophic factors, chemokines, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Iron and immunity are closely linked: firstly by the fact that many of the genes/proteins involved in iron homoeostasis play a vital role in controlling iron fluxes such that bacteria are prevented from utilising iron for growth; secondly, cells of the innate immune system, monocytes, macrophages, microglia and lymphocytes, are able to combat bacterial insults by carefully controlling their iron fluxes, which are mediated by hepcidin and ferroportin. To summarize in vitro evidence, iron deficiency depresses certain aspects of cell-mediated immunity, including lymphocyte, neutrophil and macrophage function; humoral immunity is unaffected and the significance of hypoferremia (as opposed to normal transferrin saturation) on growth of microorganisms is uncertain. Little evidence exists for systematic major humoral deficiencies in iron-deficient humans, and although specific defects in cell-mediated immunity have been well described and reviewed, even in latent iron deficiency, note that such minor functional changes cannot be compared with the devastating effects of the well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes (Dhur et al. 1989, Farthing 1989, Hershko 1993, Oppenheimer and Hendrickse 1983, Scrimshaw and San Giovanni 1997). Combining iron-rich foods with a source of vitamin C can help boost your absorption even further. That said, it's important to remember that overly high blood iron levels can be harmful and may actually suppress the immune system (5, 6, 7) Therefore, it's best to use iron supplements only if you have an iron deficiency, or on the advice of a doctor.

Therefore, we can conclude that Serbia was invited some time before opening the office, which means that NATO's decision to invite Serbia was a completed event by this time. Thus, it is possible for us to infer from context when this event occurred and therefore if it is complete or not. In contrast, we do not know when exactly Samardzic-Markovic told the press about these events; only that he did so in relation to them occurring (i.e., they may have been simultaneous), rather than him telling press before they had occurred (i.e., stating what would happen). As such, while his statement could be a completed action at this point in time as well -- since he had already said something -- there is no way for us to actually tell if this is true or false based on context alone; thus making our inference uncertain and unreliable compared with being sure about whether NATO's invitation has been completed prior or not.\\""},{"source":"(CNN) -- Gregory Sancoff thinks he knows what the Navy needs, even before U.S. war planners do.

Recently, it has become evident that most adult tissue macrophages originate during embryonic development and not from circulating monocytes. Each tissue has its own composition of embryonically derived and adult-derived macrophages, but it is unclear whether macrophages of distinct origins are functionally interchangeable or have unique roles at steady state. This new understanding also prompts reconsideration of the function of circulating monocytes. Classical Ly6c(hi) monocytes patrol the extravascular space in resting organs, and Ly6c(lo) nonclassical monocytes patrol the vasculature. Inflammation triggers monocytes to differentiate into macrophages, but whether resident and newly recruited macrophages possess similar functions during inflammation is unclear.

Although it is true that a slug can devour[  garden plants from the roots up in amazing quantities, it also produces nutrients for the soil, which help other plants grow. The diet of a slug consists of plant waste and mould, as well as living plants, making it a sort of natural recycling center.

No gardener wants to sacrifice his or her plants just to gain a few nutrients that could easily be provided by fertilizers In order to achieve a balance, both slug and gardener may have to compromise some things. One  ly easy step is to separate plants with high slug appeal from those with low appeal. That way, the sections of the garden spared for plants with high slug appeal can contain plants that the gardener is willing to sacrifice so as to protect those plants that have a lower slug appeal . Another possibility is to leave some ground-covering plants in a less tidy state, since slugs particularly enjoy semi-decayed  plant matter.

Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\\n\\n- A cartoon is a type of two-dimensional illustration. While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to (a) a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic artistic style of drawing or painting, (b) an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor, or (c) a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation.

Starting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. The most common name for this new form of music is also \\"folk music\\", but is often called \\"contemporary folk music\\" or \\"folk revival music\\" to make the distinction. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as folk rock, electric folk, and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, it often shares the same English name, performers and venues as traditional folk music; even individual songs may be a blend of the two.\\n\\n- Elektra Records is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group, founded in 1950 by Jac Holzman and Paul Rickolt. It played an important role in the development of contemporary folk music and rock music between the 1950s and 1970s. In 2004, it was consolidated into WMG's Atlantic Records Group.

Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.\\n\\n- Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.\\n\\n- A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.\\n\\n- Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular.\\nIn the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.\\n\\n- Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.\\n\\n- Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.\\n\\n- Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes.\\n\\n- Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.\\n\\n- Krautrock (sometimes called \\"kosmische Musik\\") is a broad genre of experimental rock that developed in Germany in the late 1960s. The term \\"krautrock\\" was originated by English-speaking music journalists as a humorous name for a diverse range of German bands whose music drew from sources such as psychedelic rock, avant-garde electronic music, funk, minimalism, jazz improvisation, and world music styles. Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and new-age music. Important acts of the scene include Can, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Faust.\\n\\n- New wave is a genre of rock music popular from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with ties to 1970s punk rock. New wave moved away from smooth blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop music that incorporated electronic and experimental music, mod and disco. Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct, genre. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synthpop, college rock and gothic rock.\\n\\n- Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008.\\n\\n- Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'machine age voodoo' and 'warner music group'?","target":"record label","rationale":"The album 'machine age voodoo' was first released outside the United States until 1985 when it was released by Elektra Records.\\nSo, the answer is record label"},{"source":"Given an entity as input, output another entity which is part of the input entity.

He became famous when he became the first person to produce lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)  . In addition, he was also the first person to taste it and learn about its hallucinogenic   effects. He was deeply connected to the nature and argued that LSD, besides being useful for psychiatry , could also be used to promote awareness of mankind's place in nature. However, he was disappointed that his discovery was being carelessly used as a drug for entertainment. Because of his discovery, LSD fans have fondly called him \\"The father of LSD\\".

Multi-frame Super-Resolution (MFSR) offers a more grounded approach to the ill-posed problem, by conditioning on multiple low-resolution views. This is important for satellite monitoring of human impact on the planet -- from deforestation, to human rights violations -- that depend on reliable imagery. To this end, we present HighRes-net, the first deep learning approach to MFSR that learns its sub-tasks in an end-to-end fashion: (i) co-registration, (ii) fusion, (iii) up-sampling, and (iv) registration-at-the-loss. Co-registration of low-res views is learned implicitly through a reference-frame channel, with no explicit registration mechanism. We learn a global fusion operator that is applied recursively on an arbitrary number of low-res pairs. We introduce a registered loss, by learning to align the SR output to a ground-truth through ShiftNet. We show that by learning deep representations of multiple views, we can super-resolve low-resolution signals and enhance Earth observation data at scale. Our approach recently topped the European Space Agency's MFSR competition on real-world satellite imagery.","target":"The first deep learning approach to MFSR to solve registration, fusion, up-sampling in an end-to-end manner","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nThe first deep learning approach to MFSR to solve registration, fusion, up-sampling in an end-to-end manner."},{"source":"I read this background article the other day: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior.

We differentiate two study groups: patients with (group A, n=72) or without (group B, n=66) statins. Plasma levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins (tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-2R), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), CPK-MB and troponin I were measured before and 1, 6, 24 and >72 h after surgery.   \\n RESULTS The baseline, operative and postoperative morbidity and mortality characteristics were similar for both the groups. Group A had significantly lower postoperative levels of IL-6 than group B at 6h (68.8+/-5 pg ml(-1) vs 108.9+/-108 pg ml(-1), p=0.01), 24h (71.7+/-7 pg ml(-1) vs 110.4+/-106 pg ml(-1), p=0.01) and before hospital discharge (21.6+/-12 pg ml(-1) vs 32.8+/-27 pg ml(-1), p=0.005), as well as significantly lower average IL-6 levels in the first 24h following surgery (71.8+/-5 pgml(-1) vs 112.8+/-82 pg ml(-1), p=0.002).

However, when the first captives were brought to the Americas, they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists.

Earlier in the poem, Keats says that he hopes this 'Love' will be a 'high romance' with a 'fair creature.' He also says that he hopes the 'Fame' he seeks will be the result of the 'high piled books' produced by his 'crowded brain.' In other words, Keats's fear is that death is a 'nothingness' that will arrive before he can finish his life's work or find his true love.\\nDonne has a different attitude toward death, and so the imagery in his poem is different, too.To Donne, death should 'be not proud,' because it is not 'mighty and dreadful.' Unlike Keats, Donne sees death as weak and merely a 'slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men.' He also says that death is like 'rest and sleep'.Donne believes that we will all wake from the sleep of death to everlasting life, just as we wake from our normal sleep to our everyday lives.In fact, Donne believes that it is death itself that will die: 'One short sleep past, we wake forever,/ And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.'\\nKeats and Donne both know that death is a prat of life, and both poets use powerful imagery to talk about that difficult theme.The differences in this imagery show two very different attitudes toward the subject, one of...\\nQuestion: According to the passage,   _   makes Keats's life worth living.\\nAnswer:","target":"expressing his grand passion for poetry","rationale":"The passage states that Keats's fear is 'that death will arrive before he can finish his life’s work or find his true love.'

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th.

Passage:The discography of Scottish rock band The Twilight Sad consists of five studio albums, four compilation albums, fifteen singles, and five extended plays (EPs). The band currently consists of James Graham (vocals, lyrics), Andy MacFarlane (guitar, production), Johnny Docherty (bass), Brendan Smith (keyboards) and Sebastien Schultz (drums). The Kilsyth-based band formed in 2003 and were signed to Fat Cat Records when Alex Knight, co-founder of the label, went to Glasgow to watch the band perform their third gig and signed them on the spot. The band released their debut EP The Twilight Sad in November 2006 in the United States only, followed by their debut album Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters in April 2007, which garnered widespread critical acclaim. The album spawned two singles, \\"That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy\\" in April, and \\"And She Would Darken the Memory\\" in July. The following year, the band released Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did, a mini-album of reworked versions of songs from Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters and two non-album tracks, inspired by stripped-down live performances. A collection of live versions and previously unreleased tracks entitled Killed My Parents and Hit the Road was released in December 2008. The Twilight Sad's second studio album, Forget the Night Ahead, was released in September 2009 to further acclaim and marked a shift in the band's direction towards a darker and more streamlined sound. The album produced three singles: \\"I Became a Prostitute\\" in August 2009, \\"Seven Years of Letters\\" in October 2009, and \\"The Room\\" in April 2010.

In 1986, , would be the first feature to appear under the Studio Ghibli banner, and its gentle, faintly melancholic tone would become a familiar trademark of much of the studio's later output. And later, in the 1990s, Porco Rosso and Princess Mononoke were released. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding anime industry's top musical contributors, his compositions (including eight theatrical films and one OAV) would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the 1980s and 1990s. Hisaishi also composed for such TV and movie hits as Sasuga no Sarutobi, Two Down Full Base, Tonde Mon Pe and the anime Tekuno porisu 21C (all 1982), Sasuraiger (1983), Futari Taka (1984), (1985) and Oz no mahôtsukai (1986). He also scored the sci-fi adventure series Mospeada (1983), which was later reworked (without his music) into the third segment of Carl Macek's compilation, Robotech. Other films he scored included Mobile Suit Gundam Movie II: Soldiers of Sorrow (1981), Mobile Suit Gundam Movie III: Encounters in Space, (1982), Birth (Bâsu) (1984), Arion (1986), Robot Carnival (1987), Totoro (1988), Crest of the Royal Family and Maison Ikkoku – Apartment Fantasy (both 1988), Venus Wars (1989), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), Porco Rosso (1992) and Ocean Heaven (2010).

I just really need a neutral perspective on this. \\n\\n  I have ADHD, which makes it pretty difficult to sit and focus in class without doing something with my hands. In highschool I'd find myself constantly doodling to help me listen to teachers. Through both highschool and college I've never really had any problems with it, until today. \\n  \\nCurrently I'm taking a communications class that's required of my major. Everyone gives a speech in class every two weeks or so. This class goes for 3 hours, so going in I knew I'd be fidgety. I got my speech out of the way and started drawing in my sketchbook. \\n  \\n It must have taken her sometime to notice me, because in the middle of class after a student gave their speech she called across the room for me to close my book and pay attention. She then announced to the whole class about how doing anything besides listening quietly was unacceptable and horribly disrespectful. Everyone went on break for a few minutes and I had time to put away my things.\\n \\n This is the part that probably puts me in asshole territory. If I was smart I would have not done anything and just sat quietly. But this is the 3rd time this professor has passive aggressively lectured me in front of the whole class, so I was feeling pretty grumpy. I didn't want to risk disassosiating and getting anxiety because of this teacher. So I took out my smaller sketchbook and turned more towards the speakers to show that I was paying attention. She was not happy about this.\\n\\n  After class was finished she told me to stay when everyone left. She then berated me about how horribly disrespectful and distracting I was to everyone. Because of this I'd be losing 10 percent of my grade on my own speech- and she was going to bring it up to the chairman because me drawing was that problematic to the rest of the class. She went on to aggressively tell me how horrible I was for a good few minutes. Even after explaining why I was doodling she said she didn't care. because I didn't have an accommodation letter, she couldn't(wouldn't) accept the excuse; and that other kids in class have problems and don't bother anyone in class. \\n  \\n I think she handled the whole situation rather horribly, but she has a point- I should of gotten some resources from my school's student disability services awhile ago. No matter what I end up doing I'm definitely going to talk to them about accommodations in the future so situations like this don't happen again. \\n\\nI grew up being a good student, so I'm honestly not used to handling teachers that don't like me.

After all, the common viewpoint is that those outgoing and sociable guys make great public speakers and excellent networkers and that those shy people are not. A survey conducted by USA Today referred to 65 percent of executives who believed shyness to be a barrier to leadership. Interestingly, the same article stresses that roughly 40 percent of leaders actually are quite shy--they're just better at adapting themselves to situational demands. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Charles Schwab are just a few \\"innies\\".\\nUnlike their outgoing counterparts who are more sensitive to rewards and risk-taking, shy people take a cautious approach to chance. Rather than the flashy chit-chat that defines social gathering, shy people listen attentively to what others say and absorb it before they speak. They're not thinking about what to say while the other person is still talking, but rather listening so they can learn what to say. Along the same lines, shy people share a common love of learning. They are intrinsically  motivated and therefore seek content regardless of achieving an outside standard.\\nBeing shy can also bring other benefits. Remember being in school and hearing the same kids contribute, until shy little Johnny, who almost never said a word, cut in? Then what happened? Everyone turned around to look with great respect at little Johnny actually talking. This is how shy people made good use of their power of presence:they \\"own\\" the moment by speaking calmly and purposefully, which translate to a positive image.\\nShyness is often related to modesty. Not to say that limelight-seekers aren't modest, but shy people tend to have an accurate sense of their abilities and achievements.

The first portion of the aorta after it arises from the left ventricle gives rise to the coronary arteries. There are three dilations in the wall of the aorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve. Two of these, the left posterior aortic sinus and anterior aortic sinus, give rise to the left and right coronary arteries, respectively. The third sinus, the right posterior aortic sinus, typically does not give rise to a vessel. Coronary vessel branches that remain on the surface of the artery and follow the sulci are called epicardial coronary arteries. The left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the interventricular septum. The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus to the left. Eventually, it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery. The larger anterior interventricular artery, also known as the left anterior descending artery (LAD), is the second major branch arising from the left coronary artery. It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk. Along the way it gives rise to numerous smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular artery, forming anastomoses.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. \\n\\nQuestion: What three areas of religious texts helped develop the Albanian language?\\nI found this answer \\"Catholic liturgy\\".

Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.\\n\\n- In linguistics, a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \\"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\\"), or several (\\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are \\"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\\").\\nA complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (\\"rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed\\"), or more than one root in a compound (\\"black-board, rat-race\\"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (\\"a red rock\\"), clauses (\\"I threw a rock\\"), and sentences (\\"He threw a rock too, but he missed\\").\\n\\n- The French Revolution was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.\\n\\n- A critic is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.\\n\\n- Feuilleton ( French pronunciation :  ( fœjt ) ; a diminutive of French : feuillet , the leaf of a book ) was originally a kind of supplement attached to the political portion of French newspapers , consisting chiefly of non-political news and gossip , literature and art criticism , a chronicle of the latest fashions , and epigrams , charades and other literary trifles . The term feuilleton was invented by Julien Louis Geoffroy and Bertin the Elder , editors of the French Journal des débats in 1800 . The feuilleton may be described as a \`\` talk of the town '' , and a contemporary English - language example of the form is the \`\` Talk of the Town '' section of The New Yorker . In English newspapers , the term \`\` feuilleton '' instead came to refer to an installment of a serial story printed in one part of a newspaper . The genre of the feuilleton in its French sense was eventually included in English newspapers , but was not referred to as a feuilleton . In contemporary French , feuilleton has taken on the meaning \`\` soap opera '' . German and Polish newspapers still use the term for their literary and arts sections .\\n\\n- The Journal des débats (French for: Journal of Debates) was a French newspaper, published between 1789 and 1944 that changed title several times. Created shortly after the first meeting of the Estates-General of 1789, it was, after the outbreak of the French Revolution, the exact record of the debates of the National Assembly, under the title \\"Journal des Débats et des Décrets\\" (\\"Journal of Debates and Decrees\\").\\n\\n- Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\\n\\n- Art criticism is the discussion or evaluation of visual art. Art critics usually criticise art in the context of aesthetics or the theory of beauty. A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.\\n\\n- The New Yorker is an American magazine of reportage, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. It is published by Condé Nast. Started as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans.\\n\\n- Aesthetics (also spelled æsthetics and esthetics also known in Greek as , or \\"\\"Aisthtiké\\"\\") is a branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of art, beauty, and taste, with the creation and appreciation of beauty. It is more scientifically defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgements of sentiment and taste. More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as \\"critical reflection on art, culture and nature\\". In modern English, the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the Cubist aesthetic.\\n\\n- Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.\\n\\n- A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.\\n\\n- Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") \\n\\n- A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.\\n\\n- A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. \\n\\n- An art critic is a person who is specialized in analyzing, interpreting and evaluating art. Their written critiques or reviews contribute to art criticism and they are published in newspapers, magazines, books, exhibition brochures and catalogues and on web sites. Some of today's art critics use art blogs and other online platforms in order to connect with a wider audience and expand debate about art.\\n\\n- The Estates-General (or States-General) of 1789 was the first meeting since 1614 of the French Estates-General, a general assembly representing the French estates of the realm: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate). Summoned by King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his government's financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse over the first item on the agenda: whether they should vote by estate, giving the first two estates an advantage, which was the King's choice, or vote all together, giving the Third Estate the advantage. It was brought to an end when the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, inviting the other two to join, against the wishes of the King. This signals the outbreak of the French Revolution.\\n\\n- Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'genre' with the subject 'feuilleton'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- action\\n - adult\\n - art\\n - cartoon\\n - communication\\n - criticism\\n - culture\\n - drama\\n - dramatic\\n - entertainment\\n - fashion\\n - fiction\\n - genre\\n - golf\\n - government\\n - health\\n - history\\n - image\\n - information\\n - journalism\\n - letter\\n - linguistics\\n - literary fiction\\n - literature\\n - magazine\\n - mass\\n - music\\n - narrative\\n - nature\\n - news\\n - novel\\n - novella\\n - philosophy\\n - play\\n - poetry\\n - prose\\n - rock\\n - satire\\n - serial\\n - short story\\n - society\\n - study\\n - symbolism\\n - television\\n - universe\\n - variety\\n - various\\n - video\\n - western\\n - will","target":"satire","rationale":"The feuilleton is a genre of writing, and satire is one type of that form."},{"source":"Answer the question from the given passage.

Glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine. Cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects.

NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a $50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and $33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used $63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid $5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between $700,000 and $900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said.

The first major contacts between the two countries occurred after Thailand was made an apostolic vicariate by Pope Alexander VII on 22 August 1662. The mission was assigned to the newly formed Paris Foreign Missions Society to evangelize Asia, and Siam became the first country to receive these efforts, to be followed by new missions 40 years later in Cochinchina, Tonkin and parts of China, because Siam was highly tolerant of other religions and was indeed the only country in Southeast Asia where the Catholic Fathers could establish themselves safely.

Anyway, yesterday my uncle came here to make dinner (paarents were on vacation, only me and my grandmother home) so, he is there doing whatever, and I'm here, playing on my 3DS, on an online match. Out of nowhere, he comes ate me and tells me to go buy some Ketchup, because he needs 'em. I tell him to wait, as I'm playing, he tells me to go at once and I ask for him to wait again. He then scream \\"dude, I'm cooking hurry\\" and I say \\"okay, lemme just--\\" he slaps me on the head. Oh boy, I lose it there, I punch in in the stomach and he starts yo get all angry, full of himself. He nearly broke my 3DS too. So, I decided to go at once (sorry to whoever was playing with me) and on the way I shout at him \\"piece of shit\\" he instantly comes at me with his fist closed, with a grin on his face and by there I'm ready to (try to) punch him too. If it werent for my gramma, we would have fought right there. Anyway ff, he's gone, he text me asking if I'm angry, tells me he was wrong for hitting me, but I was also wrong for not \\"obbeying\\".  He then tells me that I don't have a job, I don't help with anything and that I SHOULD do everything someone asks me, and that we live in a society and some shit like that. I send him a long text explaining that I can barelly leave my bed, and That I'm bordeline suicidal, and that I feel like a leech for my family, and that its hard to even do most things when I feel like that. he just says that he understands, says that he'll kill me if I kill myself, but that I still should do everything someone asks me. He also told me that Im lucky I have a home, and that I'm not abused by anyone etc..\\nNow, I'm not gonna lie... I'm lazy as FUCK. Like really lazy.

Also, I AM looking for a job, I'm just not lucky with that. Later on my grandma said that \\"we were both wrong because he hit me  but I also didn't obey\\". I got so pissed, I said \\"Look  HE was wrong, he came to THE HOUSE WHERE I LIVE house and started giving orders to me, and then hit me.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment.\\nMcMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive.

Classically trained in St. Petersburg, Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution, he moved to Berlin and then New York City after the Russian Revolution. In 1929, after the stock market crash, he moved to Hollywood, where he became best known for his scores for Western films, including Duel in the Sun, Red River, High Noon, The Big Sky, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Last Train from Gun Hill. Tiomkin received twenty-two Academy Award nominations and won four Oscars, three for Best Original Score for High Noon, The High and the Mighty, and The Old Man and the Sea, and one for Best Original Song for \\"The Ballad of High Noon\\" from the former film.\\n\\nTiomkin received his first break from Columbia director Frank Capra, who picked him to write and perform the score for Lost Horizon (1937). The film gained significant recognition for Tiomkin in Hollywood. It was released the same year that he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  In his autobiography, Please Don't Hate Me! (1959), Tiomkin recalls how the assignment by Capra forced him to first confront a director in a matter of music style:  [H]e gave me the job without reservation. I could write the score without interference, and he would hear it when it was done. Lost Horizon offered me a superb chance to do something big... I thought I might be going a little too far in the matter of expense, and went to Frank one day as he sat in the projection room [and explained the score.]... He looked shocked. \\"No, Dimi, the lama is a simple man. His greatness is in being simple. For his death the music should be simple, nothing more than the muttering rhythm of a drum.\\" \\"But Frank, death of lama is not ending one man, but is death of idea. Is tragedy applying to whole human race. I must be honest. Music should rise high, high. Should give symbolism of immense loss. Please don't hate me.\\"  He worked on other Capra films during the following decade, including the comedy You Can't Take It With You (1938), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Meet John Doe (1941), and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). During World War II, he continued his close collaboration with Capra by composing scores for his Why We Fight series. These seven films were commissioned by the U.S. government to show American soldiers the reason for United States participation in the war. They were later released to the general U.S. public to generate support for American involvement.

The bank repossesses everything they have and Whitney's world becomes upended. \\nHer family has to move to Whitney's grandparents' old farm in the country. There, far from her dizzying world of shallow girlfriends, endless parties, and school pressures, she finds a new best pal: Bob, a beautiful and spirited Gypsy horse belonging to her new neighbor. The neighbor, Dusty, is a crusty rancher who turns out to be her estranged grandfather. Through her new relationships with Bob, Dusty, and her parents, Whitney rediscovers what it means to respect not only nature and her family, but also someone very special she had almost lost touch with: herself.

Although already in her forties, she still lives in an apartment with her domineering mother (Annie Girardot); her father is a long-standing resident in a lunatic asylum. Throughout the film, the audience is gradually shown truths about Erika's private life. Behind her assured façade, she is a woman whose sexual repression verges into full-fledged desperation and is manifested in a long list of paraphilias, including (but by no means limited to) voyeurism and sadomasochistic fetishes such as sexual self-mutilation.Upon meeting Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel), a charming 17-year-old engineering student from a bourgeois background, they begin to obsess one another. Even though she initially attempts to prevent consistent contact and even tries to undermine his application to the conservatory, he eventually becomes her pupil. Like her, he appreciates and is a gifted (if distinct) interpreter of Schumann and Schubert.She destroys the musical prospects of an insecure but talented girl, Anna Schober, driven by her jealousy of the girl's contact with Walter -- and also, perhaps, by her fears that Anna's life will mirror her own. She does so by hiding shards of glass inside one of her coat pockets, permanently damaging Anna's hands and ruining her aspirations to play at the forthcoming jubilee concert. Erika is then wholly sympathetic when the girl's mother (Susanne Lothar) asks for advice on her daughter's recuperation.

These members are fictional and are not personas of any \\"real life\\" musicians involved in the project. Their fictional universe is explored through the band's music videos, as well as a number of other short cartoons.\\n\\nMusician Damon Albarn and comic book artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, a band Albarn and Coxon had recently formed. The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip Tank Girl. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \\"arsey, a wanker\\"; despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver. Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.  The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, \\"If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell - there's nothing of substance there.

Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music.\\n\\n- Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.\\n\\n- A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas.

Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.\\n\\n- Elliot Roberts (born Elliot Rabinowitz, February 22, 1943) is an American music manager and record executive, best known for helping to jump-start the careers of singer-songwriters from the late 1960s and 1970, including those of Neil Young and Joni Mitchell.\\n\\n- Dylan is the thirteenth studio album by American singer - songwriter Bob Dylan , released on November 19 , 1973 by Columbia Records .

It has been assumed, based upon previous studies, that the primary abnormality in these mice is simply lack of a necessary supportive or inductive material within the hemopoietic stroma. We used in vitro long-term bone marrow cultures to characterize further the nature of the hemopoietic microenvironmental defect in Sl/Sld mice. Sl/Sld mouse bone marrow cells consistently produced less than 10% of the total hemopoietic cells and multipotent and unipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells produced in cultures of marrow from normal, congenic +/+ mice. If fresh Sl/Sld and +/+ marrow cells were mixed prior to establishing long-term marrow cultures, there was a direct correlation between number of Sl/Sld cells added and degree of inhibition of +/+ hemopoiesis. A pre-established, confluent Sl/Sld adherent stromal layer inhibited hemopoiesis by fresh +/+ marrow cells by nearly 70%, as compared with dishes with irradiated +/+ or no stroma. This inhibitory effect was abrogated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma prior to addition of the fresh +/+ marrow cells. Similarly, unirradiated, but not 9 to 200 Gy irradiated Sl/Sld stroma inhibited proliferation of the factor-dependent FDC-P1 hemopoietic progenitor cell line. Thus, the Sl/Sld hemopoietic microenvironment actively inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro, and this inhibition can be at least partially eliminated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma.","target":"Anemia, Macrocytic","rationale":"The abstract reports that Sl/Sld mouse bone marrow cells consistently produce fewer hemopoietic cells and hemopoietic progenitor cells than normal, congenic +/+ mice. It also provides evidence that the Sl/Sld hemopoietic microenvironment actively inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro. The results of this study suggest that the primary abnormality in these mice is an active inhibition of stem cell division in the marrow. This type of defect could result from a lack of a supportive or inductive material within the stroma, but it seems more likely to cause a failure of hematopoiesis due to an active inhibition of stem cell division by some factor produced by the abnormal stroma.

Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits.

Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]\\n\\nAn important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which company would most likely not have tax benefits of debt, company A or company B?","target":"company B","rationale":"According to the trade-off theory, a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits.

This type of energy describes objects that are moving or could move. A moving ball can have energy from motion. An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy.

Afterwards, Harry is sent to get a chicken for lunch, but they fire a machine gun at him and throw a grenade, which Harry throws into the chicken shed, blowing them up. Nan tells Harry the story of his twin brother, Otto, which Harry claims to have heard before. \\nSuddenly, Harry and Nan then discover that their beloved pet hamster Abu is ill after he vomits a green substance on them, so they take him to the vet. He is almost put down until Harry takes him back home. Ed the vet and his assistant, Kisko, are working for Harry's neo-Nazi twin brother Otto who was abandoned by Nan in the 1970s, claiming it was because she couldn't look after them both, and was raised by Alsatians.\\nAfter another failed attempt to capture Abu (by disguising as a priest and a nun), Harry and Nan decide to take him on a trip in their Rover P6 to Blackpool for a week before he dies (when Abu really wanted to visit the home of Rihanna). Ed and his assistant pursue them on the road, until they arrive in \\"Blackpole\\" by mistake. The next day, Harry and Nan take Abu on a personal guided tour around the nuclear power plant by the cleaner.

It also explains why they were taking him on guided tours around places like the beach or nuclear power plants before his eventual death due to illness caused by said dangerous thing(s).

In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.\\n\\nand a hint : Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Would case B have higher or lower air pressure above it than case A?","target":"higher","rationale":"The context mentions that Rob is experimenting with air pressure and has created two tests, one labeled as case A and the other as case B.\\nIn the first test (case A), the air flow works in a way similar to an airplane wing, which produces lift by making air move faster over its surface than under it. This causes lower pressures on top of the wings and higher pressures beneath them, lifting up planes or birds against gravity. In contrast, in the second test (case B) where airflow behaves like a race car spoiler's would do so at slower speeds above than below it when compared to regular spoilers; this results in more downward force from greater pressures pushing downwards on cars' wheels for better traction while driving fast around corners of tracks ."},{"source":"M: Yes, Johnson's on Main street is excellent, fast and inexpensive.\\n\\nWhat was said before this conversation?","target":"W: I need a picture for my ID card.

October 22] - September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, woodsman, and frontiersman, whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States. Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now Kentucky, which was then part of Virginia but on the other side of the mountains from the settled areas. As a young adult, Boone supplemented his farm income by hunting and trapping game, and selling their pelts in the fur market. Through this occupational interest, Boone first learned the easy routes to the area.\\n\\nAfter the Revolution, Boone resettled in Limestone (renamed Maysville, Kentucky in 1786), then a booming Ohio River port. In 1787, he was elected to the Virginia state assembly as a representative from Bourbon County. In Maysville, he kept a tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. He was initially prosperous, owning seven slaves by 1787, a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time. Boone became a celebrity while living in Maysville. In 1784, on his 50th birthday, historian John Filson published The Discovery, Settlement And present State of Kentucke, a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures.  The Revolutionary War had ended, but the border war with American Indians north of the Ohio River resumed with the Northwest Indian War. In September 1786, Boone took part in a military expedition into the Ohio Country led by Benjamin Logan. Back in Limestone, Boone housed and fed Shawnees who were captured during the raid, and helped to negotiate a truce and prisoner exchange. Although the war escalated and would not end until the American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, the 1786 expedition was the last time Boone saw military action.  Boone began to have financial troubles while living in Maysville. According to the later folk image, Boone the trailblazer was too unsophisticated for the civilization which followed him and which eventually defrauded him of his land. Boone was not the simple frontiersman of legend, however: he engaged in land speculation on a large scale, buying and selling claims to tens of thousands of acres. The land market in frontier Kentucky was chaotic, and Boone's ventures ultimately failed because his investment strategy was faulty and because his sense of honor made him reluctant to profit at someone else's expense. According to Faragher, \\"Boone lacked the ruthless instincts that speculation demanded.\\"  Frustrated with the legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he operated a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. When Virginia created Kanawha County in 1789, Boone was appointed lieutenant colonel of the county militia. In 1791, he was elected to the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.  In 1795, Rebecca and he moved back to Kentucky, living in present Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first governor of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued to make their way through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Daniel Boone","rationale":"Correct answer: Daniel Boone."},{"source":"In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to subtract every value in the list with the index it is at.

For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish.

He has three younger brothers, Daniel, William, and Stephen, who also became actors. He also has two sisters, Beth and Jane. Alec and his siblings were raised as Roman Catholics.\\n\\nIn 1990, Baldwin met actress Kim Basinger when they played lovers in the film The Marrying Man. They married in 1993 and had a daughter, Ireland, in 1995. They separated in 2000, and finalized a divorce in 2002.  Baldwin chronicled his seven-year battle to remain a part of his daughter's life in his 2008 book, co-authored with Mark Tabb, A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce. Baldwin contends that after their separation in December 2000, his former wife, Kim Basinger, endeavored to deny him access to his daughter by refusing to discuss parenting, blocking visitation, not providing telephone access, not following court orders, not dropping their daughter off for reasons of convenience, and directly lobbying the child. He contends that she spent over $1.5 million in the effort. Baldwin called this parental alienation syndrome.  Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case \\"opportunists\\", and has characterized Basinger's psychologists as part of the \\"divorce industry\\". He has faulted them more than Basinger, and writes, \\"In fact, I blame my ex-wife least of all for what has transpired. She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there. Nothing off the menu, ever.\\" Baldwin wrote that he spent over a million dollars, has had to put time aside from his career, has had to travel extensively, and needed to find a house in California (he lived in New York), so that he could stay in his daughter's life.  Baldwin contended that after seven years of these issues, he hit a breaking point, and on April 11, 2007, left an angry voicemail message in response to another unanswered arranged call, in which Baldwin called his 11-year-old daughter a \\"rude, thoughtless little pig\\". He contends that the tape was sold to TMZ which released the recording, despite laws against publishing media related to a minor without the permission of both parents. Baldwin admitted that he made a mistake, but asked not to be judged as a parent based on a bad moment. He later admitted to Playboy in June 2009 that he contemplated suicide over the voicemail that leaked to the public. Of the incident, he said, \\"I spoke to a lot of professionals, who helped me. If I committed suicide, [ex-wife Kim Basinger's side] would have considered that a victory.

Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation.

It is so named because it passes through nine significant concyclic points defined from the triangle. These nine points are:\\n\\n- Karl Wilhelm von Feuerbach ( 30 May 1800 -- 12 March 1834 ) was a German geometer and the son of legal scholar Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach , and the brother of philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach . After receiving his doctorate at age 22 , he became a professor of mathematics at the Gymnasium at Erlangen . In 1822 he wrote a small book on mathematics noted mainly for a theorem on the nine - point circle , which is now known as Feuerbach 's theorem . In 1827 he introduced homogeneous coordinates , independently of Möbius .\\n\\n- Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the \\"Elements\\". Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The \\"Elements\\" begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the \\"Elements\\" states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.\\n\\n- Projective geometry is a topic of mathematics. It is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations. This means that, compared to elementary geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are that projective space has \\"more\\" points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called \\"points at infinity\\") to Euclidean points, and vice versa.\\n\\n- In mathematics, homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates, introduced by August Ferdinand Möbius in his 1827 work \\"Der barycentrische Calcül\\", are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry. They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates. Formulas involving homogeneous coordinates are often simpler and more symmetric than their Cartesian counterparts. Homogeneous coordinates have a range of applications, including computer graphics and 3D computer vision, where they allow affine transformations and, in general, projective transformations to be easily represented by a matrix.\\n\\n- A circle is a simple closed shape in Euclidean geometry. It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius.\\n\\n- Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.\\n\\n- Geometry (from the ; \\"geo-\\" \\"earth\\", \\"-metron\\" \\"measurement\\") is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.\\n\\n- In geometry, an affine transformation, affine map or an affinity (from the Latin, \\"affinis\\", \\"connected with\\") is a function between affine spaces which preserves points, straight lines and planes. Also, sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation. An affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points, though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.\\n\\n- A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices \\"A\\", \\"B\\", and \\"C\\" is denoted formula_1.\\n\\n- August Ferdinand Möbius (17 November 1790  26 September 1868) was a German mathematician and theoretical astronomer.\\n\\n- The Regnitz is a river in Bavaria, Germany. It is a left tributary of the Main and is in length.\\n\\n- In geometry, a set of points are said to be concyclic (or cocyclic) if they lie on a common circle. All concyclic points are the same distance from the center of the circle. Three points in the plane that do not all fall on a straight line are concyclic, but four or more such points in the plane are not necessarily concyclic.\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- A city is a large and permanent human settlement.

The bill, H-5087, is now before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The proposal is intended, in part, to make it easier to prosecute anyone who applies pressure on a person's throat or neck with the intent to cause harm. The chief advocate, Rep. Roberto DaSilva, a Pawtucket police officer, said he submitted it because he was seeing too many cases in which serious strangulation attempts would be prosecuted as misdemeanor simple assaults because the attack, although potentially fatal, didn't result in obvious signs of serious bodily injury. \\"\\"If you take a knife, swing it at someone and not strike them, that's a felony,\\"\\" he said. \\"\\"Under this law, strangulation itself would be a felony. When you have your hands around their throat, you've taken it to the next level. It's serious enough.\\"\\" But it was his assertion about the prevalence of the crime that caught our attention. \\"\\"Ten percent of violent deaths in the U.S. each year are due to strangulation,\\"\\" he said, adding that there are \\"\\"six female victims to every male victim.\\"\\" We wondered if the rate was really that high. DaSilva sent us a handful of documents. One was a 2001 article from the Journal of Emergency Medicine, which flatly stated that \\"\\"Ten percent of violent deaths each year in the United States are directly because of strangulation.\\"\\" Where did that statistic come from? Although the article has 35 footnotes, the \\"\\"ten percent\\"\\" statement carries no citation. Two of the three authors, Dr. George E. McClane and Gael B. Strack, a lawyer, have apparently been using this statistic for a while. DaSilva also directed us to a 1999 article in which McClane and Strack are quoted as making the same claim. Strack has repeated the statistic as recently as a 2007 article written to help prosecutors. In each case, there is no indication where the data come from. We emailed Strack, who is CEO of the Family Justice Center Alliance in San Diego; she told us it came from a paper written by McClane in 1995, which we found intriguing because no McClane research is cited in their 2001 article. Researchers are typically quick to cite their previous work each time they write a paper. We couldn't get an interview with McClane. The website of the Medical Board of California of the Department of Consumer Affairs said he surrendered his medical license in March after being found guilty of unprofessional conduct. His lawyer did not respond to an email. So we took another route. DaSilva had also sent us an article from 2007, also in the Journal of Emergency Medicine, saying that national data from 1993 showed that 11.8 percent of women and 1.9 percent of men who died that year were killed by strangulation. It didn't give an overall rate. So we went to the source: a 2003 article on firearm deaths by David Wiebe of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. It says the strangulation rate that year was 3.4 percent. That's 1 in 29, not 1 in 10. But that 3.4 percent does not include all violence-related deaths, as DaSilva did. Suicides are excluded. If you include them, as the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control does when it catalogues all \\"\\"violence-related injury deaths,\\"\\" the rate is even lower -- about 1.4 percent, or 1 in 71. That same difference is echoed in the most recent federal data, where strangulation accounted for only about 1.2 percent of the violence-related deaths in 2007. If you only look at homicides, the rate rises, but only to 3.5 percent, still far shy of 10 percent. Only when we focused on women who have been murdered did the 10-percent figure apply. Wiebe directed us to the 1998 version of the database, where 448 of the 4,241 female homicide deaths were logged as being due to strangulation. That's 10.6 percent. We calculated a similar number for 2007. (The actual numbers show that there were not six female strangulation victims for every male, as DaSilva said. Because 448 women and 213 men died of strangulation in 2008, the actual ratio was 2 to 1. To hit a 6-to-1 ratio, you have to compare the percentages of homicide deaths due to strangulation -- 10.6 percent for women and 1.6 percent for men.) In short, the \\"\\"10 percent\\"\\" statistic cited by DaSilva has been bandied about at least since the 1990s. As presented, it is false. Federal data from 1993, 1998 and 2007 show that the percentage is significantly lower, whether or not you include suicides. It may be that the federal statistics are being repeatedly misrepresented, taking numbers that were only meant to apply to female homicides and expanding them to include all violent deaths, regardless of gender. If DaSilva had said that \\"\\"10 percent of all homicide deaths among women are due to strangulation\\"\\" and that \\"\\"women who are murdered are six times more likely to die of strangulation than men who are murdered,\\"\\" he would be on solid ground. But he didn't. In his defense, he was quoting sources that should be reliable. The Journal of Emergency Medicine, for one, failed to display adequate rigor by allowing the 10-percent estimate to appear without attribution. And DaSilva is trying to address what he sees as a serious problem, especially in domestic assaults on women. Deborah DeBare, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said her organization has been concerned for a few years that strangulation assaults are not being aggressively prosecuted, even though they \\"\\"are one of the most dangerous ways of attacking someone.\\"\\" And because they are often carried out by a coldly calculating assailant, she said, the hope is that the stronger threat of jail time might be a deterrent for some men. But we make our rulings based on whether a statement is actually true or false. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that.\\n\\nWhich brother didn't have excess calcium salts deposited in the blood vessels?\\n\\nHint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.","target":"Dan","rationale":"The context states that Dan was found to be healthy and have normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels.

While many studies have been performed with eukaryotic Pif1 helicases, including yeast and human Pif1 proteins, the potential functions and biochemical properties of prokaryotic Pif1 helicases remain largely unknown. Here, we report the expression, purification and biochemical analysis of Pif1 helicase from Bacteroides sp. 3_1_23 (BsPif1). BsPif1 binds to a large panel of DNA substrates and, in particular, efficiently unwinds partial duplex DNAs with 5'-overhang, fork-like substrates, D-loop and flap-like substrates, suggesting that BsPif1 may act at stalled DNA replication forks and enhance Okazaki fragment maturation. Like its eukaryotic homologues, BsPif1 resolves R-loop structures and unwinds DNA-RNA hybrids. Furthermore, BsPif1 efficiently unfolds G-quadruplexes and disrupts nucleoprotein complexes. Altogether, these results highlight that prokaryotic Pif1 helicases may resolve common issues that arise during DNA transactions. Interestingly, we found that BsPif1 is different from yeast Pif1, but resembles more human Pif1 with regard to substrate specificity, helicase activity and mode of action.

When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. When the Entente Powers promised Romania Transylvania and Banat, large territories of eastern Hungary, in exchange for Romania's declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality. On 27 August 1916, the Romanian Army launched an attack against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, against the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counterattack by the forces of the Central Powers drove them back. As a result of the Battle of Bucharest, the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Fighting in Moldova continued in 1917, resulting in a costly stalemate for the Central Powers. Russian withdrawal from the war in late 1917 as a result of the October Revolution meant that Romania was forced to sign an armistice with the Central Powers on 9 December 1917.\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Unlike text however, music relies heavily on repetition on multiple timescales to build structure and meaning. The Music Transformer has shown compelling results in generating music with structure (Huang et al., 2018).   In this paper, we introduce a tool for visualizing self-attention on polyphonic music with an interactive pianoroll.   We use music transformer as both a descriptive tool and a generative model.   For the former, we use it to analyze existing music to see if the resulting self-attention structure corroborates with the musical structure known from music theory.   For the latter, we inspect the model's self-attention during generation, in order to understand how past notes affect future ones. We also compare and contrast the attention structure of regular attention to that of relative attention (Shaw et al., 2018, Huang et al., 2018), and examine its impact on the resulting generated music.   For example, for the JSB Chorales dataset, a model trained with relative attention is more consistent in attending to all the voices in the preceding timestep and the chords before, and at cadences to the beginning of a phrase, allowing it to create an arc.   We hope that our analyses will offer more evidence for relative self-attention as a powerful inductive bias for modeling music.   We invite the reader to explore our video animations of music attention and to interact with the visualizations at https://storage.googleapis.com/nips-workshop-visualization/index.html.","target":"Visualizing the differences between regular and relative attention for Music Transformer","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nVisualizing the differences between regular and relative attention for Music Transformer"},{"source":"What is the following passage about?\\nIn its metaphysics, Nyāya school is closer to the Vaiśeṣika school than others.

When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird.

After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist.

Passage:Charlie Biederman (November 11, 1918February 22, 1995) was a musher in Alaska best known for being the last surviving dog sled mail carrier in the United States. Charlie was born in Alaska as the son of Ed Biederman, a musher born in Bohemia who immigrated to the United States in 1874 and also delivered the mail via dog sled. The date of Charlie's birth is unclear, but contemporary U.S. Censuses indicate it likely was around 1919. Charlie had four siblings. Charlie was raised in Eagle, Alaska, but lived in an isolated cabin on the Yukon River for most of his life. From an early age, he assisted his father and brother in their winter deliveries of the mail to isolated cabins in central Alaska. In winter, the family lived in Eagle and ran the mail route between that town and Circle, another small settlement approximately downriver. In the summer, the family lived at their Yukon River cabin, harvesting fish for subsistence and boarding the dogs of fellow mushers. In 1938, the family were underbid for the main contract for mail delivery in the area by a bush pilot. Ed Biederman retired shortly afterward and died in 1945. The final dog sled mail route was replaced in 1963. That final route was from Gambell to Savoonga and was run by Chester Noongwook. In January 1995, he donated the mail-delivery sled he used to the National Postal Museum in Washington, D.C., where it hangs today. One month after making the delivery, he died on February 22, 1995.","target":"That final route was from Gambell to Savoonga and was run by Chester Noongwook","rationale":"The numbers in the question can be found in the sentence: \\"That final route was from Gambell to Savoonga and was run by Chester Noongwook.\\""},{"source":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Ed Harris starred in what 2013 film written by Bong Joon-ho and and Kelly Masterson?","target":"Snowpiercer","rationale":"The answer is based on the fact that Ed Harris starred in \\"Snowpiercer\\", a 2013 film written by Bong Joon-ho and Kelly Masterson."},{"source":"Given a passage as input, answer with the category to which the passage belongs.

Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity.

Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875.\\nThe company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford.

The ballad evolved from \\"Hey Jules\\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, during his parents' divorce. \\"Hey Jude\\" begins with a verse-bridge structure incorporating McCartney's vocal performance and piano accompaniment; further instrumentation is added as the song progresses. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a fade-out coda that lasts for more than four minutes. \\"\\n\\nUpon the single's release, Derek Johnson of the NME wrote: \\"The intriguing features of 'Hey Jude' are its extreme length and the 40-piece orchestral accompaniment - and personally I would have preferred it without either!\\" While he viewed the track overall as \\"a beautiful, compelling song\\", and the first three minutes as \\"absolutely sensational\\", Johnson rued the long coda's \\"vocal improvisations on the basically repetitive four-bar chorus\\". Time magazine described the coda as \\"a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending pop records\\". The same reviewer contrasted \\"Hey Jude\\" with its B-side, \\"Revolution\\", saying that \\"The other side of the new disk urges activism of a different sort\\", due to McCartney \\"liltingly exhort[ing] a friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love\\". Rolling Stone also attributed the song's meaning as a message from McCartney to Lennon to end his negative relationships with women: \\"to break the old pattern; to really go through with love\\". Other commentators interpreted \\"Hey Jude\\" as being directed at Bob Dylan, then semi-retired in Woodstock.  Writing in 1971, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called it \\"one of [McCartney's] truest and most forthright love songs\\" and was critical of its omission from the album The Beatles. In their 1975 book The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler wrote that \\"Hey Jude\\" \\"promised great things\\" for the ill-conceived Apple enterprise and described the song as \\"the last great Beatles single recorded specifically for the 45s market\\". They noted also that \\"the epic proportions of the piece\\" encouraged many imitators, yet these other artists \\"[failed] to capture the gentleness and sympathy of the Beatles' communal feel\\".  Among more recent commentators, Alan Pollack admires \\"Hey Jude\\" as \\"such a good illustration of two compositional lessons - how to fill a large canvas with simple means, and how to use diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast.\\" Pollack considers that the song's long coda provides \\"an astonishingly transcendental effect\\", while AllMusic's Richie Unterberger similarly opines: \\"What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic because McCartney varies the vocal with some of the greatest nonsense scatting ever heard in rock ...\\" In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald wrote that the \\"pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out may be a blemish\\" but he praised the song as \\"a pop/rock hybrid drawing on the best of both idioms\\". MacDonald concluded: \\"'Hey Jude' strikes a universal note, touching on an archetypal moment in male sexual psychology with a gentle wisdom one might properly call inspired.\\" Lennon said the song was \\"one of [McCartney's] masterpieces\\".\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Hey Jude","rationale":"The text provides a lot of information about the song \\"Hey Jude\\".\\nIt describes its origin and influence, as well as various interpretations. \\nAll this is centered around Hey Jude: it's name comes up in every sentence (except for one) and all sentences revolve around it.

Hydrophobin coated NPs are shown to strongly increase the stability and the dispersion when exposed to human plasma compared to pristine ones particles.

The mean follow-up period was 8.7 posttransplant years (range 1-21 years). During this time period 176 skin cancers were diagnosed in 47 patients. The overall risk to develop a first tumor increased from 10% after 10 years to 40% after 20 years of graft survival. The overall incidence of SCC was 250 times higher and that of BCC 10 times higher when compared with the general Dutch population. Moreover the localization of SCCs and BCCs differed considerably. Solar radiation is thought to be an important risk factor for the development of skin cancer. However, the occurrence of skin cancer in long-term graft survivors forms also a major problem in a country with a higher geographical latitude and a moderate amount of sun-exposure, such as the Netherlands.","target":"Incidence of skin cancer after renal transplantation in The Netherlands","rationale":"The title should give an overview of the main findings in the study. The abstract describes a case-control study that examined the incidence of SCC and BCC in patients who received renal allografts at a hospital over a 22-year period.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals.

With 2:38 remaining in the game, the Broncos' defense denied a 4th-and-long pass completion from Carr to Reece near midfield. However, the Broncos were unable to earn a game-clinching first down just before the two-minute warning, which forced the Raiders to burn two of their three team timeouts. On the very next play, a defensive pass interference penalty on Broncos' cornerback Bradley Roby while defending a pass from Carr to wide receiver Amari Cooper moved the football to the Broncos' 32-yard line. With only one timeout remaining, the Raiders decided to send Janikowski onto the field for a 50-yard field goal to pull the Raiders to within 16-10 with 1:45 remaining in the game. The Raiders' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, and were forced to use their last timeout on the Broncos' first play from scrimmage. Running back C. J. Anderson gained only two yards on three running plays. With eight seconds remaining, Cooper received a punt near the goal line, but the Broncos' defensive special teams subdued the Raiders' last desperation play of the game. The Broncos earned their eighth consecutive win over the Raiders, the Broncos' longest winning streak over the Raiders in franchise history, a streak that the Raiders would snap later in the season, during the teams' Week 14 rematch in Denver.\\n\\nHow many points did Oakland lose by?","target":"6","rationale":"The Raiders scored 10 points (7 in the first half, 3 in the second half), and lost by 6."},{"source":"Produce a brief English sentence that would be considered grammatically as category: unacceptable\\nAll categories: OPTIONS:\\n- unacceptable\\n- acceptable","target":"Mary considered his to have loved her.","rationale":"Here's an example of a grammatically incorrect sentence: Mary considered his to have loved her.\\nIn this case, the subject-verb agreement error is due to \\"his\\" and \\"her.\\" The verb must agree in number with its subject."},{"source":"Read the following article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: A \\"Gap Year\\" is a period of time when a student takes a break before going to university. It is often spent travelling or working.

However, in recent years, more and more American students are preparing for college by taking a gap year. The advantages of taking a gap year are as follows:\\nLearn about the World and Yourself\\nAlthough you don't have to go abroad to experience gap years, most gap year students catch the chance to travel abroad. You are able to work out who you are and what you are for. The experiences of different cultures offer you interesting lessons. You can learn more about the world and get to know yourself better.\\nFace Challenges and Have Fun\\nA gap year is not only a time to take a vacation, but also a time to face challenges. Gap year students usually work, volunteer or take service projects. You have to learn how to get along in the real world. This process isn't always easy, but it is an important part of growing up. Only in this way can you enjoy life and have fun.\\nSave Money and Improve Your College Admission Chances\\nThere's a common thought that gap years are only for rich students,but it' s not true. Actually, taking a gap year can save your money. Gap year students often take a part-time job. Besides, at the end of a gap year, students are much more likely to know what to study in college.

However, resistant strains may impose substantial challenges. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a panel of HIV-1 strains with broad and potent resistance against a large number of bnAbs, particularly those targeting the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that several key epitope mutations facilitate resistance and are located in the inner domain, loop D, and β23/loop V5/β24 of HIV-1 gp120. The resistance is largely correlated with binding affinity of antibodies to the envelope trimers expressed on the cell surface. Our results therefore demonstrate the existence of broadly resistant HIV-1 strains against CD4bs neutralizing antibodies. Treatment strategies based on the CD4bs bnAbs must overcome such resistance to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. Recently identified broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) show great potential for clinical interventions against HIV-1 infection. Among the bnAbs isolated to date, those targeting the CD4bs are the most abundant and thoroughly studied as they disrupt the crucial step of viral interaction with the cellular receptor molecule CD4. Despite the superior potency and breadth of these CD4bs bnAbs, each fails to neutralize a small but significant portion of pseudotyped virus panels. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a panel of HIV-1 strains with broad and potent resistance against a large number of bnAbs, particularly those targeting the CD4bs. Resistance is largely attributed to mutated residues within the epitopes or steric hindrance imposed by the bulky side-chain or glycan shield of the mutated residues, and is largely correlated with reduced binding avidity of the antibody to the quaternary trimeric envelope protein expressed on the PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.surface of the transfected cells. Treatment strategies based on the CD4bs bnAbs therefore must overcome such resistance to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. Recent scientific advances have identified a growing number of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), providing promising candidates for HIV-1 prevention and treatment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Compared with bnAbs isolated in earlier studies, these bnAbs demonstrated broader and more potent activity against global HIV-1 panels and displayed impressive safety and efficacy profiles for therapeutic applications in a number of animal models and human clinical trials [1, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . These results also offer the opportunity to tailor these antibodies and maximize their prevention and treatment potential. Broadly speaking, these bnAbs recognize six major \\"vulnerable sites\\" on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 (gp120 and gp41), which are (1) the CD4-binding site (CD4bs), (2) the V1V2 apex, (3) the V3 glycan, (4) the fusion peptide (FP), (5) subunit interface and (6) membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41[1-5]. These bnAbs neutralize HIV-1 by blocking viral entry into the target cells, although additional effector functions are likely at play, particularly in the context of in vivo infection and clinical application[1, 12-16]. Among the bnAbs isolated to date, those targeting the CD4bs are the most abundant and thoroughly studied as they disrupt the first and crucial step of viral interaction with the cellular receptor CD4 [3, 4, 17, 18] . In this step, the trimeric envelope glycoprotein, composed of gp120 and gp41, binds with the target cell through the receptor CD4, with either CCR5 or CXCR4 as co-receptor [19] [20] [21] . This triggers a cascade of conformational changes that fuses the viral envelope with the target membrane and releases the viral genome into the cell [22, 23] .More than two dozen CD4bs bnAbs have been isolated to date. This number is likely to grow with the advent of more specific and high-throughput techniques for isolating antibodies.For instance, the prototype VRC01 and its close relative VRC03, which effectively neutralize a panel of diverse pseudotyped viruses,were isolated from a clade-B infected individual [24] [25] [26] . The more recently isolated CD4bs bnAbs, such as 3BNC117, N6, N49P7, 3BNC60, VRC-PG04, VRC-PG20, NIH45-46, VRC-CH31, 12A12, CH103, 8ANC131, VRC13, and VRC16, have shown similar or even enhanced potency and breadth compared with VRC01 [1-5, 27, 28].The CD4bs bnAbs are classified into two groups based on their mode of recognition and heavy chain characteristics, such as the VRC01 class(3BNC117, N6, N49P7, 3BNC60, VRC-PG04, VRC-PG20, NIH45-46, VRC-CH31 and 12A12) and non-VRC01 classes (CH103, 8ANC131, VRC13 and VRC16) [17, 18] . Structurally, these bnAbs recognize residues within the inner domain, the Loop D, the CD4 binding loop, and the β23/loop V5/β24 region [17, 18, [29] [30] [31] .The V1V2 and V3 loop also impact recognition,particularly in the context of the quaternary trimeric envelope protein [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] .The primary mechanism of neutralization mimics and competes with the CD4 receptorto bind HIV-1 gp120, thereby preventing bound trimers from transitioning to the subsequent steps required for membrane fusion, although evidence indicates that there are differences in the fine details of this process [17, 18, 35, 36] . Despite the superior potency and breadth of these CD4bs bnAbs, each fails to neutralize a small but significant portion of pseudotyped virus panels [17, 25, 27, 28, 37, 38].For instance, VRC01 is unable to neutralize about 10% of tested viruses [25] , and resistant strains have been isolated from patients infected with subtype B, subtype C, CRF07_BC, and CRF08_BC[29, [39] [40] [41] [42] . Furthermore, reports show thatVRC01-, 3BNC117-and N6-resistant strains have emerged in both animal models and human clinical trials [11, 15, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] , indicating that resistant virus Broadly resistant HIV-1 against CD4bs antibodies PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.org/10. \\n Title: Broadly resistant HIV-1 against CD4-binding site neutralizing antibodies","target":"False","rationale":"The title is \\"Broadly resistant HIV-1 against CD4-binding site neutralizing antibodies\\". It accurately describes the key finding of this study, which is that there are HIV-1 strains that are broadly and potently resistant to a large number of neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site (CD4bs). However, the title does not mention other important findings of this study, such as: (1) Information about these resistant strains was obtained by examining clinical tissue samples; (2) The fact that several key epitope mutations facilitate resistance against these neutralizing antibodies; and (3) The fact that resistance is largely correlated with reduced binding affinity for envelope glycoproteins expressed on cell surfaces.

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime.

When Danish king Eric opened the Baltic trade routes for Dutch ships and introduced a new toll for all foreign ships passing the Øresund , six Hanseatic cities  declared war, put a naval blockade on Scandinavian harbours and allied with Eric's enemy Henry IV, count of Holstein. Therefore the war was intensively linked with the Dutch-Hanseatic War , the Kalmar War with Holstein  and the Swedish revolt . After years of changing fortune in warfare Rostock and Stralsund signed a separate peace agreement in 1430. Lübeck, Hamburg, Wismar and Lüneburg, however, continued the war and assisted Holstein to conquer Flensburg in 1431. Thereafter they agreed an armistice in 1432 and started peace negotiations. Meanwhile an anti-Danish revolt broke out in Sweden . In 1434 Eric had to agree an armistice with the Swedes, too. In April 1435 he signed the peace of Vordingborg with the Hanseatic League and Holstein, followed by the peace of Stockholm with Sweden a few months later the same year. The Hanseatic cities were excepted from the Sound Dues but they had to accept Dutch competition in the Baltic trade. The Danish Duchy of Schleswig was ceded to the count of Holstein. Sweden's autonomous rights and privileges were extended.

She was the first woman to earn US$100,000 through her writing. Wilson was a native of Columbus, Georgia, and her first book, Inez, a Tale of the Alamo, was written when she was still young.\\n\\nAugusta Evans Wilson was not a professional writer and her style was severely criticized as \\"pedantic.\\" She wrote in the domestic, sentimental style of the Victorian Age. Critics have praised the intellectual competence of her female characters, but as her heroes eventually succumb to traditional values, Wilson has been described as an antifeminist. Of St. Elmo one critic maintained, \\"the trouble with the heroine of St. Elmo was that she swallowed an unabridged dictionary.\\" Wilson was the first American woman author to earn over $100,000. This would be a record unsurpassed until Edith Wharton.  Macaria, or Altars of Sacrifice, published in 1864, was popular with Southerners and Northerners alike. Melissa Homestead writes that the transportation of the novel to New York was deliberate, done in installments and nearly simultaneous with the novel's preparation for publication in the South. Thus, while previous critics, scholars and biographers have all treated Macaria's appearance in the North as unauthorized, the truth is much more meaningful. Some scholars say that by dispensing with the romantic notion that the novel appeared in a \\"bootleg\\" edition, Homestead debunks the hard and fast distinction between Northern and Southern readerships as an invention of historians and critics rather than an accurate reflection of reading practices of the period. However, a great number of discrepancies exist between the version published in the North and the version published in the South, which remove huge portions of the text which romanticize the Southern heroes that are portrayed.  Her novel St. Elmo was her most famous and it was frequently adapted for both the stage and screen. It inspired the naming of towns, hotels, steamboats, and a cigar brand. The book's heroine, Edna Earl, became the namesake of Eudora Welty's heroine (Edna Earle Ponder) in The Ponder Heart published in 1954. The novel also inspired a parody of itself called St. Twel'mo, or the Cuneiform Cyclopedist of Chattanooga (1867) by Charles Henry Webb.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what else did the critics have to say about her?","target":"Critics have praised the intellectual competence of her female characters, but as her heroes eventually succumb to traditional values, Wilson has been described as an antifeminist.","rationale":"The passage describes the critics' opinions of Wilson's writing style and her novels.

My half-sister is 24, and we'll call her L. My dad is 55 and his GF is 54 or 53. Now that we have the ages out of the way, I'll get on with the story.\\n\\nSome background: L is my mother's daughter, and not my father's. They do not get along, as our/my parents are divorced and L has made some choices my dad disagrees with. L also has a three-year-old daughter.\\n\\nSo, my dad, his girlfriend, and I went to a football game. My dad had noticeably drank a lot and was slurring his words. His gf sees nothing wrong with it and he decides to DRIVE us to my sister's workplace, a restaurant with a pretty nice bar. He orders a single drink and we sit down.\\n\\nOf course, I want to see my sister - I saw her car in the parking lot. I ask one of the waitresses if she can wave her over, and soon enough, my sister comes over. She greets us and is acting as sweet and as respectful as she could.  We talk a little bit and she asks me if I could see her before we leave. I don't see anything wrong, and neither do my dad or his gf, and I agree. My dad is still slurring his words, and once we finish eating, I walk to the to-go area to say goodbye to my sister.\\n\\nShe suddenly hugs me, warning me that my dad is drunk beyond belief and that she wants me to text her when I get home to my mother's to make sure I'm safe. She's seen my dad drunk (and I hadn't at this time) and was extremely concerned. She had talked to the other employees about it, but they couldn't cut him off because he had only ordered one drink at the establishment, and while he was showing red flags, they couldn't do anything about it due to their policy. I agree to do so, worried, and I head back over to my dad's table.\\n\\nI said something along the lines of, \\"Dad, I think you're a little drunk. I think it would be safer for us if \\\\[his GF\\\\] drove instead.\\" Now, keep in mind, this was entirely my idea.\\n\\nTHEY BOTH GET PISSED. His girlfriend starts angrily blaming my sister for *something she didn't even suggest.* She walks to the middle of the restaurant where the entrance is and starts demanding to see my sister, and I try to calm her down and say that we should leave. My dad is silent this entire time. His GF starts to yell about it, and after pretty much dragging her out of the restaurant before my sister caught wind of it from the other side, GF starts going off about stuff that she doesn't fucking know anything about. We also almost threw hands. A thirteen year-old. AND A GROWN FUCKING ADULT.\\n\\n(From here on out, I'm pretty biased and still pretty pissed.)\\n\\nSo, I keep pushing the idea that she should drive instead of my dad. She gets mad and claims that my dad \\"has barely drank anything\\" and that \\"he wasn't drunk\\", which *he obviously was*. She then starts saying my sister \\"doesn't even know how to raise a child\\" and that \\"she needs to get her fucking life together before she comes in here spouting lies\\". Lemme ask, what the *fuck* does that have to do with this??? This was her first time meeting L, too.\\n\\nShe goes on and on about how horrible of a person my sister is as my dad gets into the driver's seat and I into the back. Now, I cry when I'm angry, and that's what I was doing - I was pissed beyond belief and couldn't just tell her to stop because then my dad would get mad at ME for being \\"disrespectful\\" (as he did later on anyways.). I refused to speak after one particularly rude thing his GF said to me, and I stayed silent until I get back to my mom's.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR:** My dad got drunk and we went to my sister's workplace. She stated he was drunk and was worried about me. I told my dad that his GF should drive home instead and she was pissed off for absolutely no reason.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\\n\\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST :   \\n\\nBeen on reddit for about a month or so at this point and this will be my first post so forgive me if I'm doing anything wrong as far as formatting goes or typos. Also a  long post so sorry for the long read, just needed to vent. \\n\\nTo start, a little bit of back story is necessary to understand everything in the story. I had met a gal on a dating app about five years ago and we had \\"dated\\" for a bit before things went to shit. Now something that's important to know is that she lived in another state, (I know, very dumb and foolish of me) but that didn't matter to me because I loved our conversations and had hoped that maybe we would meet up and see where things went from there. I also confirmed that she wasn't a catfish since that was when the show on MTV just got big and made it one of my main concerns but that's just a random side note. Mind you that I was about a year in a half out of high school at this time and was far from having any sort of money to be able to go on a trip by myself. Nonetheless I went through with pursuing a relationship with her and after we split, we remained good friends but would have moments where we wouldn't talk to each other for a few months here and there. Sometimes it would be because we would fight and make up later. Other times we would just fall off. We'll call her Cali for the story. \\n\\nNow before any of of that happened it is also important to know this tid bit. A good year or two before I met Cali, I volunteered at a basketball camp that my church held in which a youth group from Missouri came up and helped us out. Now being an awkward/weird kid in in high school, (still awkward, but much more comfortable in social situations, I try to make others laugh with my weirdness) I began to come out of my shell a bit and I would chit chat with some of the nice folk from the youth group. Ended up befriending some of them and adding them on the Book of Face. One of the people that I added was a girl who I had a crush on, but never really thought I had a chance with so it was mostly us making small talk and just catching up every few months. She did come with the group again the next year, but I had a gf at the time so anything with her relationship wise wasn't even a question. We'll call her...Mizzou. \\n\\nNow fast forward to this year, where I have a better paying job and can actually do some of the things that I want to do on my own. I've also become more confident in myself and I'm not as afraid to ask certain questions. So still having feelings for Cali, I suggest we meet each other in person as we had started to begin falling for each other again. She says yes and I'm like holy shit, this is great! I offered to get a hotel for her to stay in while she visits since she would be the one coming to me. Figured I should definitely help out and try to make it easier on her especially if it was my idea. She later claims that she has a cold and can't come only to later admit that she flaked out on me. Fan-fucking-tastic. \\n\\nSeveral months later, I start up with Mizzou again and one day I give her a compliment on her smile or something and she responds surprisingly well to it. So well that she ends up asking me to come out and hang with her. I'm like hold up, you serious my gal? Pffft, hell yeah. We end up at the point to where we're talking all day, every day for a good five months before my journey to visit her. We would snapchat, talk on the Book of Face, Facetime. The whole nine yards. Now over the course of the five months, I'm keeping it cool and just being my naturally weird/awkward self while also flirting with her here and there and letting her know that I'm interested to which she begins to flirt back too. It even gets to a point to where I'm talking about how if I had the chance to date her I would to which she replies, \\"You never know what could happen\\" which I respond by losing my shit because that made me so fricken happy. I get the vacation days from work off and I am more than excited to see her again. But what do ya know, her ex shows up about half way through my five/six day stay while I'm there and just makes everything weird. We go from talking and being super pumped and excited to do all this stuff around the city that she planned out each day, to her always being on her phone and seeming kind of distant. And when I mean kinda distant, I mean losing all the motivation to do anything at all. Save for a few moments here and there, she was just silent. Maybe she was embarrassed or old feelings had been brought up again. Anyways she ends up taking me to meet her parents and hang with some of her friends a few nights and I'm like ok this good. I felt a little froze out here and there with her friends, but I blame that on me being nervous around them and just meeting them. Then before I leave she apologized for that lovely guest appearance from her ex and I'm like it's ok. Not your fault. It's fine it is what it is...or is it? \\n\\nTurns out she told him when I was coming so that he wouldn't pop up and make things awkward, which made absolutely no sense to me. As far as I was tracking, they weren't on good terms based on the break up and what happened after. She was heartbroken over that. And that's totally understandable. I wouldn't have expected her to move on and not let it get to her so soon. Looking back at it now, as much as I hate to say it, she might have looked at me as a way to get her ex back or just make him jealous. I say this only because as far as I know, if she wasn't talking to him while she was talking to me, then why fucking bring it up to him. To me, the chances of him showing up were slim to none if he broke up with her a good eight months or so ago if she had just not told him. So this angered me as I found this out once I returned home but it still didn't change how I felt about her. Me being too caught up in the idea of being in a relationship with her, I had even considered going to a college not too far from her so that way I could finish my degree as well as work on things with her. I ran this by her about two weeks after I got back, and she gave me the standard \\"idk, I haven't thought about it (it being us dating)  too much\\" and I could accept that. Just to make sure that I wasn't given a bs answer, I asked if what she had thought about us was good or bad to which she said that it was good. Ok, cool so although she didn't say yes to the idea, it wasn't a complete no to it either. Two or three weeks go by again at this point and I'm feeling like our conversations just aren't the same as she is beginning to seem distant. So why not ask the question again! She ends up giving me the same \\"idk\\" answer before I tell her to just say what's on her mind straight up. She ends up telling me she isn't ready for a relationship which sucked, but more than anything made me angry as I felt like she had felt that way for some time. I don't mind that she said she wasn't ready, I was just mad because I felt lead on. Needless to say that was all I needed to cut that friendship off. I was just too hurt and upset to be able to talk with her without thinking about all of that. I tried to talk to her in recent month but it's just not the same. \\n\\nFast forward to a few weeks ago and I'm telling Cali about this, along with several other stories of me being used recently, and after I'm finished telling her she just disappears, but yet was still posting stories on her snap. This irritated me since usually she would listen to me vent and we could talk about everything but this one time all she says is \\"that sucks. I gotta go.\\" and when I asked what was wrong she just left me on read. That's cool. I'll bitch about it for a few then I'll probably be over it in a day or two. The next day when I get off shift, I see she messaged me and she apologized saying that what she did wasn't cool but she was a tad bit upset with me. Upset with me over what? I don't get enough sleep already and with work taking up 15 hours of my day, I wasn't exactly in the best mood to hear from her after that stunt the night before. Anyways, I will admit that I responded with a \\"entertain me\\" when she asked if I wanted to know why she was upset the previous night. She went on to say that she should \\"cut my sorry ass\\" out of her life and that I probably shouldn't be one of her closest friends in the first place. She tells me that she was upset because when we were \\"together\\", I hadn't thought about coming to visit her but I did for Mizzou and how she (Cali) didn't mean shit to me. Apparently when I was telling her my history with Mizzou, the only thing she heard was that we had ONLY talked for five months and completely ignored the fact that I had known Mizzou for a good minute. Oh, did I forget to mention that when I first started talking to Cali, she had mentioned numerous times about her town being full of racist, one of which being her step-father. Being a minority, that definitely sounds like a nice place to visit right? I explained all this to her as well as bringing up her backing out on the visit that I mentioned earlier which ended up in us talking things out so we ended up on good terms by the end of the night.\\n\\n It's been a week since that and we still haven't talked and I'm honestly not upset about that. I feel that if we were as close of friends as she says yet she would drop me over something that in my opinion is extremely ridiculous to even be mad about, then maybe I should be the one distancing her. I have been flip flopping on this idea since. On one hand, I do value our friendship and that's where I think maybe I need to just calm down, but also at the same time I feel expendable if she's willing to cut things off over something like that. I understand how she put that idea together, but I don't think see how she can be upset about it when SHE ba","target":"no","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning whether they are right or wrong for trying to get back together with an ex-girlfriend.\\\\nThe author states that they have developed feelings for the ex-girlfriend again, which suggests that this is a hypothetical situation in which both parties are considering getting back together.

His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture.\\nContext: In 1919, Klee applied for a teaching post at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart. This attempt failed but he had a major success in securing a three-year contract (with a minimum annual income) with dealer Hans Goltz, whose influential gallery gave Klee major exposure, and some commercial success. A retrospective of over 300 works in 1920 was also notable.  Klee taught at the Bauhaus from January 1921 to April 1931. He was a \\"Form\\" master in the bookbinding, stained glass, and mural painting workshops and was provided with two studios. In 1922, Kandinsky joined the staff and resumed his friendship with Klee. Later that year the first Bauhaus exhibition and festival was held, for which Klee created several of the advertising materials. Klee welcomed that there were many conflicting theories and opinions within the Bauhaus: \\"I also approve of these forces competing one with the other if the result is achievement.\\"  Klee was also a member of Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four), with Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Alexej von Jawlensky; formed in 1923, they lectured and exhibited together in the USA in 1925. That same year, Klee had his first exhibits in Paris, and he became a hit with the French Surrealists. Klee visited Egypt in 1928, which impressed him less than Tunisia. In 1929, the first major monograph on Klee's work was published, written by Will Grohmann.  Klee also taught at the Dusseldorf Academy from 1931 to 1933, and was singled out by a Nazi newspaper, \\"Then that great fellow Klee comes onto the scene, already famed as a Bauhaus teacher in Dessau. He tells everyone he's a thoroughbred Arab, but he's a typical Galician Jew.\\" His home was searched by the Gestapo and he was fired from his job. His self-portrait Struck from the List (1933) commemorates the sad occasion. In 1933-4, Klee had shows in London and Paris, and finally met Pablo Picasso, whom he greatly admired. The Klee family emigrated to Switzerland in late 1933.  Klee was at the peak of his creative output. His Ad Parnassum (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his pointillist style; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings. He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany. However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as scleroderma after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso. Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year. He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others sober, perhaps reflected his alternating moods of optimism and pessimism. Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee's pictures were included in an exhibition of \\"Degenerate art\\" and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.\\nQuestion: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","target":"Klee taught at the Bauhaus","rationale":"The context provides a significant amount of information about Paul Klee. \\nIt mentions that he was an artist who taught at the Bauhaus school, and it describes his style as influenced by Expressionism, Cubism and Surrealism.

It has found numerous applications in several hard problems, such as domain adaptation, dimensionality reduction or generative models. However, its use is still limited by a heavy computational cost. Our goal is to alleviate this problem by providing an approximation mechanism that allows to break its inherent complexity. It relies on the search of an embedding where the Euclidean distance mimics the Wasserstein distance. We show that such an embedding can be found with a siamese architecture associated with a decoder network that allows to move from the embedding space back to the original input space. Once this embedding has been found, computing optimization problems in the Wasserstein space (e.g. barycenters, principal directions or even archetypes) can be conducted extremely fast. Numerical experiments supporting this idea are conducted on image datasets, and show the wide potential benefits of our method.","target":"We show that it is possible to fastly approximate Wasserstein distances computation by finding an appropriate embedding where Euclidean distance emulates the Wasserstein distance","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe show that it is possible to fastly approximate Wasserstein distances computation by finding an appropriate embedding where Euclidean distance emulates the Wasserstein distance."},{"source":"Pick the most correct option to answer the following question.\\n\\nScientists perform experiments to test hypotheses.

A linear accelerometer was affixed to the lever arm. Speed settings were standardized percentages of each machine's maximum tachometer feedback voltage (0 to 100% Vfb max). Regression of Cybex transducer-observed voltages (V0) on true, i.e., expected, torques (Me) revealed that, for any static loading condition or angle, the measurement system was essentially linear and valid, although greater variance was evident for smaller torques. However, different calibrations, i.e., regression lines, were required for different speed settings. The error in predicting Me from V0 increased substantially with increased % Vfb max. Methodologies which assume constant velocity dynamic loading induce questionable, often invalid, results and inferences. Dynamic V0 represents both gravitational and inertial components. Considerable fluctuations in lever arm instantaneous velocity were ascribed to the combined influence of load and % Vfb max upon the servomotor. After computing inertia-corrected Me, calibration variability and prediction error were markedly reduced. Unexplained variability may be due to poor proximity of the Cybex transducer to the force application point. We concluded that: Cybex II should be calibrated only statically; use of an optimal filter will avoid false estimates of joint torque; inertial corrections must be applied in order to minimize potentially serious errors due to system angular acceleration; and reported muscle function relationships might be usefully re-assessed in view of these findings. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes a variety of numerical values such as speed settings (0 to 5 rad X s-1), inertial loading conditions, and lever arm instantaneous velocity.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, $8,033/ha and $13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a...","target":"Coleman","rationale":"In the middle of the article, there is a sentence \\n\\"According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key...\\".

On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.\\n\\nand the situation: Pam is an astronaut who has been given a mission to find a new planet for humans to live on.

CR1 on neutrophils bearing monovalent anti-CR1 was not attached to the cytoskeleton. In contrast, cross-linked CR1 on erythrocytes and cross-linked MHC Class I on neutrophils were not cytoskeleton associated. A possible role for filamentous actin (F-actin) in the binding of cross-linked CR1 to neutrophil cytoskeleton was suggested by three observations. When neutrophils were differentially extracted with either Low Salt-detergent buffer or High Salt-detergent buffer, stained with FITC-phalloidin, and examined by fluorescent flow cytometry, the residual cytoskeletons generated with the former buffer were shown to contain polymerized F-actin, whereas cytoskeletons generated with the latter buffer were found to be depleted of F-actin. In parallel experiments, High Salt-detergent buffer was also found to release cross-linked CR1 from neutrophils. Second, depolymerization of F-actin by DNAse I released half of the cytoskeletal-associated cross-linked CR1. Third, immunoadsorbed neutrophil CR1, but not MHC Class I or erythrocyte CR1, specifically bound soluble 125I-actin. In addition, Fc receptor and CR3, other phagocytic membrane proteins of neutrophils, specifically bound 125I-actin. These data demonstrate that CR1 cross-linked on neutrophils becomes associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton and that this interaction is mediated either directly or indirectly by actin. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"It contains numerical data that describes the measurements and results of a study.

He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the \\"Father of the Texas Blues\\". Jefferson's performances were distinctive because of his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists.\\n\\nLargely because of the popularity of artists such as Jefferson and his contemporaries Blind Blake and Ma Rainey, Paramount became the leading recording company for the blues in the 1920s. Jefferson's earnings reputedly enabled him to buy a car and employ chauffeurs (this information has been disputed); he was given a Ford car \\"worth over $700\\" by Mayo Williams, Paramount's connection with the black community. This was a common compensation for recording rights in that market. Jefferson is known to have done an unusual amount of traveling for the time in the American South, which is reflected in the difficulty of placing his music in a single regional category.  Jefferson's \\"old-fashioned\\" sound and confident musicianship made it easy to market him. His skillful guitar playing and impressive vocal range opened the door for a new generation of male solo blues performers, such as Furry Lewis, Charlie Patton, and Barbecue Bob. He stuck to no musical conventions, varying his riffs and rhythm and singing complex and expressive lyrics in a manner exceptional at the time for a \\"simple country blues singer.\\" According to the North Carolina musician Walter Davis, Jefferson played on the streets in Johnson City, Tennessee, during the early 1920s, at which time Davis and the entertainer Clarence Greene learned the art of blues guitar.  Jefferson was reputedly unhappy with his royalties (although Williams said that Jefferson had a bank account containing as much as $1500). In 1927, when Williams moved to Okeh Records, he took Jefferson with him, and Okeh quickly recorded and released Jefferson's \\"Matchbox Blues\\", backed with \\"Black Snake Moan\\". It was his only Okeh recording, probably because of contractual obligations with Paramount. Jefferson's two songs released on Okeh have considerably better sound quality than his Paramount records at the time. When he returned to Paramount a few months later, \\"Matchbox Blues\\" had already become such a hit that Paramount re-recorded and released two new versions, with the producer Arthur Laibly. In 1927, Jefferson recorded another of his classic songs, the haunting \\"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\\" (again using the pseudonym Deacon L. J. Bates), and two other uncharacteristically spiritual songs, \\"He Arose from the Dead\\" and \\"Where Shall I Be\\". \\"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\\" was so successful that it was re-recorded and re-released in 1928.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"How did that move go?","rationale":"The last sentence of the article implies that it was an unusual move because Jefferson reputedly earned enough money to buy a car and employ chauffeurs.

He published 80 volumes of history on Ancient Rome, beginning with the arrival of Aeneas in Italy. The volumes documented the subsequent founding of Rome (753 BC), the formation of the Republic (509 BC), and the creation of the Empire (31 BC), up until 229 AD. Written in Ancient Greek over 22 years, Dio's work covers approximately 1,000 years of history. Many of his 80 books have survived intact, or as fragments, providing modern scholars with a detailed perspective on Roman history.\\n\\n- Aelius Herodianus ( Greek :   ) or Herodian ( fl . 2nd century CE ) was one of the most celebrated grammarians of Greco - Roman antiquity . He is usually known as Herodian except when there is a danger of confusion with the historian also named Herodian . He was the son of Apollonius Dyscolus and was born in Alexandria . From there he seems to have moved to Rome , where he gained the favour of the emperor Marcus Aurelius , to whom he dedicated a work on prosody .\\n\\n- Elagabalus , also known as Heliogabalus (203  March 11, 222), was Roman emperor from 218 to 222. A member of the Severan dynasty, he was Syrian, the second son of Julia Soaemias and Sextus Varius Marcellus. In his early youth he served as a priest of the god Elagabal in the hometown of his mother's family, Emesa. As a private citizen, he was probably named Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus. Upon becoming emperor he took the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus. He was called Elagabalus only after his death.\\n\\n- Herodian or Herodianus of Syria, sometimes referred to as \\"Herodian of Antioch\\" (c. 170  c. 240), was a minor Roman civil servant who wrote a colourful history in Greek titled \\"History of the Empire from the Death of Marcus\\" (    ) in eight books covering the years 180 to 238. His work is not entirely reliable although his relatively unbiased account of Elagabalus is more useful than that of Cassius Dio. He was a Greek (perhaps from Antioch) who appears to have lived for a considerable period of time in Rome, but possibly without holding any public office. From his extant work, we gather that he was still living at an advanced age during the reign of Gordianus III, who ascended the throne in 238.

In Shigella, IpaD gene is one of the key pathogenic genes causing strong mucosal immune system reactions. Anthrax disease is caused by Bacillus anthracis. PA protective antigen is one of the subunits in anthrax toxin complex responsible for the transfer of other subunits into the cytosol of host cells. The 20 kDa subunit of PA (PA20) has the property of immunogenicity. CTxB or B subunit of Vibrio cholerae toxin (CT) is a non-toxic protein and has the function to transfer toxic subunit into cytosol of the host cells by binding to GM1 receptor. The aim of this study was to fuse PA20, ipaD and CTxB and transform tomato plants by this cassette in order to produce an oral vaccine against shigellosis, anthrax and cholera. CTxB was used for these two antigens as an immune adjuvant. IpaD and PA20 genes were cloned in pBI121 containing the CTxB gene and Extensin signal peptide. In order to evaluate the transient expression of Shigellosis, Anthrax and Cholera antigens, agro-infiltrated tomato tissues were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the gene cassette. Cloning was confirmed by PCR, enzymatic digestion and sequencing techniques. Expression of the antigens was examined by SDS-PAGE, dot blot and ELISA. Maturate green fruits demonstrated the highest expression of the recombinant proteins. The first phase of this study was carried out for cloning and expressing of CtxB, ipaD and PA20 antigens in tomato.

People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.\\nObesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.\\nObesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.\\nObesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of...\\n\\n- Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.\\nTobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.\\nMany cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at...\\n\\n- Eating disorders are mental disorders defined by abnormal eating habits that negatively affect a person's physical or mental health. They include binge eating disorder where people eat a large amount in a short period of time, anorexia nervosa where people eat very little and thus have a low body weight, bulimia nervosa where people eat a lot and then try to rid themselves of the food, pica where people eat non-food items, rumination disorder where people regurgitate food, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder where people have a lack of interest in food, and a group of other specified feeding or eating disorders. Anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse are common among people with eating disorders. These disorders do not include obesity.\\nThe cause of eating disorders is not clear. Both biological and environmental factors appear to play a role. Cultural idealization of thinness is believed to contribute. Eating disorders affect about 12 percent of dancers. Those who have experienced sexual abuse are also more likely to develop eating disorders. Some disorders such as pica and rumination disorder occur more often in people with intellectual disabilities. Only one eating disorder can be diagnosed at a given time.\\nTreatment can be effective for many eating disorders. This typically involves counselling, a proper diet, a normal amount of exercise, and the reduction of efforts to eliminate food. Hospitalization is occasionally needed. Medications may be used to help with some of the associated symptoms. At five years about 70% of people with anorexia and 50% of people with bulimia recover. Recovery from binge eating disorder is less clear and estimated at 20% to 60%. Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death.\\nIn the developed world binge eating disorder affects about 1.6% of women and 0.8% of men in a given year. Anorexia affects about 0.4% and bulimia affects about 1.3% of young women in a given year. During the entire life up to 4% of women have anorexia, 2% have bulimia, and 2% have...\\n\\n- Professor Gerald Francis Morris Russell (born 12 January 1928) is a British psychiatrist. In 1979 he published the first description of bulimia nervosa, and Russell's sign has been named after him.\\n\\n- Bulimia nervosa , also known as simply bulimia , is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging . Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time . Purging refers to attempts to rid oneself of the food consumed . This may be done by vomiting or taking a laxative . Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics , stimulants , fasting , or excessive exercise . Most people with bulimia have a normal weight . The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth . Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression , anxiety , and problems with drugs or alcohol . There is also a higher risk of suicide and self - harm . Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition . The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30 % and 80 % . Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress , cultural pressure for a certain body type , poor self - esteem , and obesity . Living in a culture that promotes dieting and having parents that worry about weight are also risks . Diagnosis is based on a person 's medical history , however this is difficult as people are usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits . Furthermore , the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia . Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder , Kleine - Levin syndrome , and borderline personality disorder . Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary treatment for bulimia . Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI ) or tricyclic antidepressant class may have a modest benefit . While outcomes with bulimia are typically better than in those of anorexia , the risk of death among those affected is higher than that of the general population . At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50 % of people are fully recovered . Globally , bulimia was estimated to affect 6.5...\\n\\n- Vomiting, also known as emesis and throwing up, among other terms, is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose.\\nVomiting can be caused by a wide variety of conditions; it may present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis or poisoning, or as a non-specific sequela of disorders ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation. The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea, which often precedes, but does not always lead to, vomiting. Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, where dehydration develops, intravenous fluid may be required.\\n\\n- A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a diagnosis by a mental health professional of a behavioral or mental pattern that may cause suffering or a poor ability to function in life. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders.\\nThe causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context. A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis.\\nServices are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers, using various methods but often relying on observation and questioning. Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options. Other treatments include social interventions, peer support, and self-help. In a minority of cases there might be involuntary detention or treatment. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression.\\nCommon mental disorders include depression, which affects about 400 million, dementia which affects about 35 million, and schizophrenia, which affects about 21 million people globally. Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion. \\n\\n- A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur.\\nThe cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity.\\nTreatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the...\\n\\n- Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness.\\nThe most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide.\\nApproximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females.\\nViews on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of...\\n\\n- Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected.\\nCauses include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red.\\nTreatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If...\\n\\n- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a psychosocial intervention that is the most widely used evidence-based practice for treating mental disorders. Guided by empirical research, CBT focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognitions (e.g., thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes), behaviors, and emotional regulation. It was originally designed to treat depression, and is now used for a number of mental health conditions.\\n\\n- A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in psychiatry, the branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, study, and treatment of mental disorders. Psychiatrists are medical doctors, unlike psychologists, and must evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental ailments, or strictly psychiatric.\\n\\n- Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an interdisciplinary approach to clinical practice that has been gaining ground following its formal introduction in 1992. It started in medicine as evidence-based medicine (EBM) and spread to other fields such as audiology, speech-language pathology, dentistry, nursing, child life specialty, psychology, social work, education, library and information science. EBP is traditionally defined in terms of a \\"three legged stool\\" integrating three basic principles: (1) the best available research evidence bearing on whether and why a treatment works, (2) clinical expertise (clinical judgment and experience) to rapidly identify each patient's unique health state and diagnosis, their individual risks and benefits of potential interventions, and (3) client preferences and values \\n\\n- Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.\\nBoth environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'bulimia nervosa' with the relationship of 'medical specialty'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- genetics\\n - pathology\\n - psychiatry\\n - surgery","target":"psychiatry","rationale":"Bulimia nervosa is a condition related to eating disorders.

Pokémon is the second best-selling video game franchise, behind only Nintendo's \\"Mario\\" franchise and one of the Highest-Grossing Media franchises of all time.\\n\\n- The original Square Enix Co., Ltd. was formed as the result of a statutory merger between Enix Corporation and Square Co., Ltd. on April 1, 2003, with Enix legally absorbing Square. Each share of Square's common stock was exchanged for 0.85 shares of Enix's common stock. At the time, 80% of Square Enix staff were made up of former Square employees. As part of the merger, former Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed president of the new corporation, while former Enix president Keiji Honda was named its vice president, and the founder of Enix, Yasuhiro Fukushima, the largest shareholder of the combined corporation, became its honorary chairman. As a result of the merger, Square Co., Ltd. was dissolved and Enix was the surviving company. \\n\\n- Gameplay.\\nAlthough there are different features in each of the titles, the major gameplay in each title are the same. The player assumes the role of a Pokémon that was transformed from a human, found by the player's Pokémon partner in the start of the game. Before the game starts, the player will need to go through a personality test; this will decide which Pokémon the player is in the game (with the exception of the WiiWare games, \\"Gates to Infinity\\", and \\"Super Mystery Dungeon\\", where the player may choose their starter). Gameplay is based on a classic roguelike game, with the player navigating the randomly generated dungeon with their Pokémon team. Movement and actions are turn-based; the player can use basic attacks, Pokémon moves, and items. The game starts with one partner Pokémon, but the player can recruit other Pokémon that they meet in the dungeon into their team soon after the first mission.\\n\\n- Although most \\"Final Fantasy\\" installments are stand-alone stories with different settings and main characters, they feature identical elements that define the franchise. Recurring elements include plot themes, character names, and game mechanics. Plots center on a group of heroes battling a great evil while exploring the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, pop culture, and mythologies of cultures worldwide.\\n\\n- Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.\\n\\n- The is an 8-bit handheld video game device with interchangeable cartridges developed and manufactured by Nintendo, which was first released in Japan on , in North America on and in Europe on . It is the first handheld console in the Game Boy line and was created by Satoru Okada and Nintendo Research & Development 1. This same team, led by Gunpei Yokoi at the time, is credited with designing the Game & Watch series as well as several popular games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Redesigned versions were released in 1996 and 1998 in the form of Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Light (Japan only), respectively.\\n\\n- A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it.\\n\\n- A ratite is any of a diverse group of large, flightless birds of the infraclass Palaeognathae. The systematics involved have been in flux. Some sources state that ratites include all the flightless birds of the Palaeognathae; previously, all these birds had been assigned to the order Struthioniformes, which is more recently regarded as containing only the ostrich. The modern bird superorder Palaeognathae consists of ratites and flighted Neotropic tinamous (compare to Neognathae). Unlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum  hence the name from the Latin \\"ratis\\" (for raft). Without this to anchor their wing muscles, they could not fly even if they were to develop suitable wings. Recent research has indicated that ratites are a paraphyletic group; tinamous fall within them, and are the sister group of the extinct moa. This implies that flightlessness is a trait that evolved independently multiple times in different ratite lineages.\\n\\n- The bird order Casuariiformes has four surviving members: the three species of cassowary, and the only remaining species of emu. The emus are classified in the family Dromaiidae, while the cassowaries are all located within the Casuariidae family.\\n\\n- Mystery Dungeon (  Fushigi no Danjon ) is a series of roguelike video games , most of which were developed by Chunsoft ( later Spike Chunsoft ) , but with select titles in the series developed by other companies with Chunsoft 's permission . The series began when co -- creator of Dragon Quest , Koichi Nakamura , was inspired by a fellow developer 's experience with the video game Rogue and a desire to create an original series . The franchise has had games across different platforms , starting on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , and later on , among others , the Game Boy , Nintendo 64 , Game Boy Advance , Nintendo DS , Wii , and the Nintendo 3DS . Original characters include Shiren the Wanderer and his companions . The series has inspired similar titles in Japan , most of which appropriate their games ' mechanics from Mystery Dungeon rather than Rogue itself . The series has had moderate popularity , and has found most of its success with the Torneko no Daibken : Fushigi no Dungeon and Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series , and to a lesser extent the Chocobo games .\\n\\n- Flightless birds are birds that through evolution lost the ability to fly. There are over 60 extant species including the well known ratites (ostrich, emu, cassowary, rhea and kiwi) and penguins. The smallest flightless bird is the Inaccessible Island rail (length 12.5 cm, weight 34.7 g). The largest (both heaviest and tallest) flightless bird, which is also the largest living bird, is the ostrich (2.7 m, 156 kg). Ostriches are farmed for their decorative feathers, meat and their skins, which are used to make leather. \\n\\n- The game's story centers on four youths whose parents were killed during an army invasion by the empire of Palamecia, who are using hellspawn to conquer the world. Three of the four main characters join a rebellion against the empire, embarking on missions to gain new magic and weapons, destroy enemy superweapons, and rescue leading members of the resistance. The Game Boy Advance remake adds a bonus story after the game is completed.\\n\\n- History.\\nPredating the video game company, \\"Game Freak\\" was a self-published video game magazine created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori in the 1980s. Tajiri wrote and edited the text and Sugimori illustrated. Tajiri also used \\"Game Freak\\" as his pen name when he wrote as a freelance writer to publications such as \\"Family Computer Magazine\\" and \\"Famicom Tsshin\\".\\n\\n- A cameo role or cameo appearance (often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts, typically unnamed or appearing as themselves. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake), or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common. A crew member of the show or movie playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as Alfred Hitchcock's frequently performed cameos.\\n\\n- The is a fictional species from the \\"Final Fantasy\\" video game series made by Square and Square Enix (since 2003). The creature is a flightless bird, with a resemblance to casuariiformes and ratites, capable of being ridden and otherwise used by player characters during gameplay. Chocobos first appeared in \\"Final Fantasy II\\" and have been featured in almost all subsequent \\"Final Fantasy\\" games, as well as making cameo appearances in numerous other games. A spin-off \\"Chocobo\\" series featuring chocobos has also been created.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'mystery dungeon' with the relationship of 'instance of'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 12\\n - april\\n - bird\\n - boy\\n - character\\n - comic\\n - company\\n - crew\\n - culture\\n - entertainment\\n - fictional character\\n - final\\n - four\\n - franchise\\n - game\\n - group\\n - history\\n - human\\n - industry\\n - invasion\\n - island\\n - league\\n - line\\n - market\\n - may\\n - member\\n - order\\n - part\\n - pen\\n - pen name\\n - performing arts\\n - person\\n - personality\\n - personality test\\n - player character\\n - plot\\n - pop\\n - research\\n - result\\n - roguelike\\n - role\\n - series\\n - share\\n - show\\n - species\\n - square\\n - system\\n - systematics\\n - team\\n - television\\n - three\\n - title\\n - trait\\n - value\\n - vice\\n - video\\n - video game\\n - video game series\\n - will\\n - wing","target":"video game series","rationale":"The best answer to the question is video game series.\\nBased on the information, we know that Mystery Dungeon was originally a Japanese roguelike video game, developed by Chunsoft (later Spike Chunsoft), and published by Nintendo.

Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- Menatalligator is an extinct genus of alligatorid crocodilian . Fossils have been found that are Eocene in age from a locality in the commune of Menat in the Puy - de - Dôme department of France . The type and only species , named in 1937 , is M. bergouniouxi . The strata from which remains of Menatalligator have been found are part of the Chaîne des Puys , a volcanically active chain of mountains in the Massif Central . The deposit is thought to have formed through the deposition of sediments in a body of water that filled a volcanic crater during the early Eocene ( Ypresian ) . Fossil fish such as Amia valenciennense and Thaumaturus have been found from the same strata as Menatalligator , and most likely comprised a portion of its diet . The presence of the early primate - like plesiadapiform Plesiadapis insignis from these strata also make the area important to the study of early mammalian evolution after the Cretaceous -- Paleogene boundary ( K -- T boundary ) .\\n\\n- Nice (; Niçard , classical norm, or \\"\\", nonstandard,  ) is the fifth most populous city in France and the capital of the Alpes-Maritimes \\"département\\". The urban area of Nice extends beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of about 1 million on an area of . Located in the French Riviera, on the south east coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and the second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. Nice is about 13 kilometres (8 miles) from the principality of Monaco, and its airport is a gateway to the principality as well.\\n\\n- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.\\n\\n- Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- French Guiana (pronounced or ), officially called Guiana, is an overseas department and region of France, located on the north Atlantic coast of South America in the Guyanas. It borders Brazil to the east and south, and Suriname to the west. Its area has a very low population density of only 3 inhabitants per km, with half of its 244,118 inhabitants in 2013 living in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest outermost region within the European Union.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .\\n\\n- In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.\\n\\n- The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain.\\n\\n- Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.\\n\\n- Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or  ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille. Inhabitants of the city are called \\"Lyonnais\\".\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Toulouse is the capital city of the southwestern French department of Haute-Garonne, as well as of the Occitanie region. The city lies on the banks of the River Garonne, from the Mediterranean Sea, from the Atlantic Ocean, and from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France with 466,297 inhabitants in January 2014. \\nThe Toulouse Metro area is, with 1 312 304 inhabitants as of 2014, France's 4th metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon and Marseille and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. \\n\\n- The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'menatalligator' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?","target":"alligatoridae","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"alligatoridae\\"."},{"source":"Can we conclude that \\"Bob would be here by this time.\\" if the statement \\"Adam can't leave work here until Bob arrives to replace him.

The environmental factors  such as sunshine and wind affect the skin in similar ways. The scientists ruled this possibility out as well.\\n3. Empathy . This is the theory  the scientists believe in.

This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5 billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2 AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, as a result of the vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600 K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700 current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.As the Sun expands, it will swallow the planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; although the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) will cause the planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up as a result of tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.Gradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11 times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770 K.

Following his work as vocalist on Steve Vai's 1993 album Sex & Religion and its 1994 tour, Townsend believed he had been a \\"musical whore\\", spending \\"the first five years of [his] career working at the behest of other people\\". During a brief stint as touring guitarist for The Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from an A&R representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as \\"just noise\\". He faced further rejection by Relativity Records, the label behind Vai's Sex & Religion, who saw no commercial appeal in his music. Century Media Records subsequently contacted the musician, offering him a contract to \\"make us some extreme albums\\". Townsend agreed to a five-album deal with the record label.Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, under the moniker Strapping Young Lad. According to Townsend, the recording process took \\"about a week\\". Embracing The Wildhearts' anarchist approach, \\"while focusing on dissonance and just being as over-the-top as [he] could\\", Townsend sang on the record and performed the majority of its instrumental tracks (with the assistance of a drum machine).  A few songs, however, featured local session musicians, including guitarist Jed Simon, Townsend's future bandmate.\\nReleased on April 4, 1995, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing was not widely recognized in the metal community. The album sold 143 copies in its first six months, but received favorable reviews from the heavy metal press. Its unusual musical ideas—a synthesis of death, thrash, and industrial metal influences—prompted Andy Stout from Metal Hammer to call it \\"one of the most disturbing albums you'll hear for a very long time\\".

Headlamps are white or selective yellow lights placed in the front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle's direction of travel to following drivers. White rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear, warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing turn signals on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction.
