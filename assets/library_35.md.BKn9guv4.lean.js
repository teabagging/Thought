Sheffield United and York City later agreed on an additional £15,000 fee plus a five-percentage sell-on clause. He made his debut for Sheffield United at the age of 17, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute in a 1–0 home win against Crewe Alexandra in the First Division on 29 November 1997. He made a total of nine First Division appearances in the 1997–98 season. Woodhouse holds the record for being the club's youngest ever captain, aged 19. He earned a call-up to the England under-21 team, and made his debut in a 2–2 away draw against Hungary on 27 April 1999. He went on to earn another three caps against Sweden, Bulgaria and Poland in England's 2000 European Under-21 Championship qualifying group.

Sixteen previous songs by the singer are included: \\"Un Buen Perdedor\\", from his debut album of 1984; and \\"Aquí Estás Otra Vez\\", from Fantasía (1986); \\"Louis\\" and \\"Te Amo\\", from Al Norte del Sur (1989); \\"No Basta\\", the lead single from Extranjero (1990); \\"Y Te Pienso\\" and \\"Cálido y Frío\\", from Voces a mi Alrededor (1993); \\"Si Quieres Decir Adios\\" and the title track from the 1993 album Fuera de Este Mundo; and \\"Si Tú No Estás\\" and \\"Te Veo Venir Soledad\\", selected from Nada es Igual (1999).

Two songs were previously unreleased. De Vita chose Mexican singer Alejandra Guzmán to record the lead single \\"Tan Sólo Tú\\", since he thought she was \\"perfect\\" for the song. \\"Mira Más Allá\\" is the other new song included. De Vita also stated his intention to record a sequel to Primera Fila; since many songs in his repertoire were left out, \\"I would like to include Shakira on a ballad...

The test was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto desert about 35 miles (56 km) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, on what was then the USAAF Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, now part of White Sands Missile Range. The only structures originally in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components. A base camp was constructed, and there were 425 people present on the weekend of the test.\\nThe code name \\"Trinity\\" was assigned by Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, inspired by the poetry of John Donne. The test was of an implosion-design plutonium device, informally nicknamed \\"The Gadget\\", of the same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. The complexity of the design required a major effort from the Los Alamos Laboratory, and concerns about whether it would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test. The test was planned and directed by Kenneth Bainbridge.\\nFears of a fizzle led to the construction of a steel containment vessel called Jumbo that could contain the plutonium, allowing it to be recovered, but Jumbo was not used. A rehearsal was held on May 7, 1945, in which 108 short tons (96 long tons; 98 t) of high explosive spiked with radioactive isotopes were detonated.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.","target":"building X","rationale":"Based on the context, it can be inferred that building Y has more people over 65 years of age as compared to building X. It is also mentioned in the paragraph that most people above 65 years of age have retired from work and hence would have more time for their hobbies as compared to other individuals under 65 years old who are still at work.\\nSo, the answer is Building X"},{"source":"Q: Stomata are the main avenues of transpiration, the evaporative loss of water from what?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"leaves","rationale":"Transpiration is the loss of water from plants through their leaves.

One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle.\\nWhen the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\"\\nI learned a lot from that.

A scar is collagen-rich skin formed after the process of wound healing that differs from normal skin. Scarring occurs in cases in which there is repair of skin damage, but the skin fails to regenerate the original skin structure. Fibroblasts generate scar tissue in the form of collagen, and the bulk of repair is due to the basket-weave pattern generated by collagen fibers and does not result in regeneration of the typical cellular structure of skin. Instead, the tissue is fibrous in nature and does not allow for the regeneration of accessory structures, such as hair follicles, sweat glands, or sebaceous glands. Sometimes, there is an overproduction of scar tissue, because the process of collagen formation does not stop when the wound is healed; this results in the formation of a raised or hypertrophic scar called a keloid. In contrast, scars that result from acne and chickenpox have a sunken appearance and are called atrophic scars. Scarring of skin after wound healing is a natural process and does not need to be treated further. Application of mineral oil and lotions may reduce the formation of scar tissue. However, modern cosmetic procedures, such as dermabrasion, laser treatments, and filler injections have been invented as remedies for severe scarring. All of these procedures try to reorganize the structure of the epidermis and underlying collagen tissue to make it look more natural.\\n\\n\\nQ: What is name for a piece of collagen-rich skin formed after the process of wound healing that differs from normal skin?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- tissue\\n\\n- Sore\\n\\n- size\\n\\n- scar\\n\\nA:","target":"scar","rationale":"The paragraph explains that a scar is collagen-rich skin formed after the process of wound healing and it differs from normal skin.

Shelf life, storage tips & expiration A: A refrigerator keeps all foods safe to eat for four hours without electricity. Beyond that time, some, but not all foods remain safe to eat. Foods that should be discarded after four hours are meats, dairy, soft unprocessed cheeses, and prepared meals or leftovers. What's the fridge life? For semi-hard and semi-soft cheeses -- the middle ground -- your time frame is a little less than harder cheeses. There's more moisture present in the cheeses, so they aren't going to keep as long. I'd say two to four weeks after the expiration date is the basic time frame. Here are some tips for proper way of refrigerating cheese: 1  Keep refrigerated and tightly sealed.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so.

As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria--then part of Austria-Hungary--and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I.\\n\\nAdolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire. He was christened as \\"Adolphus Hitler\\". He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Polzl. Three of Hitler's siblings--Gustav, Ida, and Otto--died in infancy. Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883). When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany. There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life. The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned school) in nearby Fischlham.  The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school. Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest. In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.  Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau, and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed. Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900. Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw \\"what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream\\".  Like many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age. He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg Monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire. Hitler and his friends used the greeting \\"Heil\\", and sang the \\"Deutschlandlied\\" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.  After Alois's sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave. He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved. In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.  In 1907 Hitler left Linz to live and study fine art in Vienna, financed by orphan's benefits and support from his mother. He applied for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna but was rejected twice. The director explained his drawings showed \\"unfitness for painting\\" and suggested Hitler was better suited to studying architecture. Though this was an interest of his, he lacked the academic credentials as he had not finished secondary school. On 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47. In 1909 Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and Meldemannstrasse dormitory. He earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of Vienna's sights.  During his time in Vienna he pursued a growing passion for two interests, architecture and music, attending ten performances of Lohengrin, his favorite Wagner opera.  It was here that Hitler first became exposed to racist rhetoric. Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger exploited the climate of virulent anti-Semitism and occasionally espoused German nationalist notions for political effect. German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler lived. Georg Ritter von Schonerer became a major influence on Hitler. He also developed an admiration for Martin Luther. Hitler read local newspapers such as Deutsches Volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews. He read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon and Arthur Schopenhauer.  The origin and development of Hitler's anti-Semitism remains a matter of debate. His friend, August Kubizek, claimed that Hitler was a \\"confirmed anti-Semite\\" before he left Linz. However, historian Brigitte Hamann describes Kubizek's claim as \\"problematical\\". While Hitler states in Mein Kampf that he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna, Reinhold Hanisch, who helped him sell his paintings, disagrees. Hitler had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna. Historian Richard J. Evans states that \\"historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany's defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid \\"stab-in-the-back\\" explanation for the catastrophe\\".  Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany. Hitler was called up for conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army, so he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service, he returned to Munich. Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.  In August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army. According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria. Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment), he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines. He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914. On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, Hitler's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's Gefreiter rank. He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.  During his service at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout. Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, and--by his own account--upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.  Hitler described the war as \\"the greatest of all experiences\\", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery. His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany's capitulation in November 1918. His bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology. Like other German nationalists, he believed the Dolchstosslegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, \\"undefeated in the field\\", had been \\"stabbed in the back\\" on the home front by civilian leaders, Jews, and Marxists, later dubbed the \\"November criminals\\".  The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany must relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation--they especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war. The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.\\n\\nHow long was he in the war?","target":"was shocked by Germany's capitulation in November 1918.","rationale":"The given context describes Hitler's service in the Bavarian Army during World War I.

Wells Fargo will let you know as quickly as possible whether there will be a hold on a deposited check. If possible, the teller will notify you immediately at the time of deposit and your receipt will show how much of the deposit is being held and when the funds will be available to you. A hold means that although a check amount was credited to your account, it's not available for your use. Wells Fargo Bank's general policy is to make deposited funds available on the first business day after the Bank receives a deposit. In some cases, however, we may place a hold on funds deposited by our customers. What happens when a hold is placed on your funds? During the time a hold is in effect, you should not write checks against or attempt to withdraw the held funds. If a hold has been placed, we may return checks that you have written if the aggregate amount of funds (not including the “hold” check) in your account is insufficient to pay the checks (which are subject to additional charges) or not process withdrawals against these funds.

The length of time your money is held depends largely on bank policy. Some banks will hold funds for as little as one business day, while others will hold funds for longer. How long a hold is in effect also depends on the source of the check. An out-of-state personal check might be held for three or four days, while a check issued by the U.S. Treasury might have no hold at all. In some cases, depending on how large the check is, and who issued it, the hold can be as long as five to 10 business days. For banks, the hold is a way of limiting risk. The bank is paying money to you, and acting in good faith on the assumption that there is money in the account the check is drawn on.

This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish.

He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week’s assignment required 6–7 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page.

We estimated neuropathy progression using Loess Fit and Gompertz Fit models.   \\n RESULTS For the 283 patients studied (mean age, 56.4 years), intercountry genotypic variation in the transthyretin (TTR) mutation was observed, with the majority of patients in Portugal (92%) having early-onset Val30Met-FAP. There was also marked intercountry variation in PND score, FAP stage, and TTR stabilizer use.

Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land.

The background information describes how evaporation causes fulvic acids to build up in the upper soil profile. Soil with more organic matter tends to have higher levels of clay minerals (and thus less percolation) than sandy soils, so the buildup is likely greatest on Bill's parcel because it has a combination of a lot of vegetation from being covered in grasslands as well as low permeability due to having a large amount of clay-rich soil. Bob's parcel most likely contains little or no humic material and also lacks clay content, which means that both leaching and water movement are unlikely to be limited by high amounts of either type \\nof materials found in his topsoil layer.

His career was noted for his rapid rise to major general and his close association with General-in-chief Ulysses S. Grant, who transferred Sheridan from command of an infantry division in the Western Theater to lead the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the East. In 1864, he defeated Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and his destruction of the economic infrastructure of the Valley, called \\"The Burning\\" by residents, was one of the first uses of scorched earth tactics in the war. In 1865, his cavalry pursued Gen. Robert E. Lee and was instrumental in forcing his surrender at Appomattox.\\n\\nSheridan was promoted to lieutenant general on March 4, 1869. In 1870, President Grant, at Sheridan's request, sent him to observe and report on the Franco-Prussian War. As a guest of the King of Prussia, he was present when Napoleon III surrendered to the Germans, which was gratifying to Sheridan following his experiences with the French in Mexico. He later toured most of Europe and returned to the U.S. to report to Grant that although the Prussians were \\"very good brave fellows [who] had gone into each battle with the determination to win, ... there is nothing to be learned here professionally.\\" He criticized their handling of cavalry and likened their practices to the manner in which Meade had attempted to supervise him. However he referred to theirs as a \\"perfect military system\\" and had a high opinion of the officer corps. His words on the French were much more harsh; he criticized the French army for not taking numerous opportunities to halt the German advance, for advancing slow and clumsily themselves, for not taking any of the numerous good opportunities to cut the enemy's unguarded lines of communication, and for routing frequently. He remarked: \\"I am disgusted; all my boyhood's fancies of the soldiers of the great Napoleon have been dissipated, or else the soldiers of the \\"Little Corporal\\" have lost their elan in the pampered parade soldiers of the 'Man of Destiny'.\\"  In 1871, Sheridan was present in Chicago during the Great Chicago Fire and coordinated military relief efforts. The mayor, Roswell B. Mason, to calm the panic, placed the city under martial law, and issued a proclamation putting Sheridan in charge. As there were no widespread disturbances, martial law was lifted within a few days. Although Sheridan's personal residence was spared, all of his professional and personal papers were destroyed. When Chicago's Washington Park Race Track organized the American Derby in 1883 he served as its first president.  Sheridan served as commander in chief of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) veterans' organization from 1886 to 1888. He was also the first president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac when it was founded in 1869.  On November 1, 1883, Sheridan succeeded General William T. Sherman as Commanding General of the U.S. Army, and held that position until his death. He was promoted on June 1, 1888, shortly before his death, to the rank of General in the Regular Army (the rank was titled \\"General of the Army of the United States\\", by Act of Congress June 1, 1888, the same rank held earlier by Grant and Sherman, which is equivalent to a five-star general, O-11, in the modern U.S. Army).\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What did he do postbellum","target":"Sheridan was promoted to lieutenant general on March 4, 1869.","rationale":"From the given context, it seems obvious that Sheridan was promoted to lieutenant general on March 4, 1869.\\nTherefore, his postbellum work is as follows: In 1870, President Grant sent him to observe and report on the Franco-Prussian War.

Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

Under 100 words is a good title length.\\n\\nGenome-wide transcriptional profiling provides a global view of cellular state and how this state changes under different treatments (e.g. drugs) or conditions (e.g. healthy and diseased). Here, we present ProTINA (Protein Target Inference by Network Analysis), a network perturbation analysis method for inferring protein targets of compounds from gene transcriptional profiles. ProTINA uses a dynamic model of the cell-type specific protein-gene transcriptional regulation to infer network perturbations from steady state and time-series differential gene expression profiles. A candidate protein target is scored based on the gene network's dysregulation, including enhancement and attenuation of transcriptional regulatory activity of the protein on its downstream genes, caused by drug treatments. For benchmark datasets from three drug treatment studies, ProTINA was able to provide highly accurate protein target predictions and to reveal the mechanism of action of compounds with high sensitivity and specificity. Further, an application of ProTINA to gene expression profiles of influenza A viral infection led to new insights of the early events in the infection. Figure 1. Protein target prediction by ProTINA. (A) The protein-gene network describes direct and indirect regulations of gene expression by transcription factors (TF) and their protein partners (P), respectively. A drug interaction with a protein is expected to cause differential expression of the downstream genes in the PGN. (B) Based on a kinetic model of gene transcriptional process, ProTINA infers the weights of the protein-gene regulatory edges, denoted by a kj , using gene expression data. The variable a kj describes the regulation of protein j on gene k, where the magnitude and sign of a kj indicate the strength and mode (+a kj : activation, -a kj : repression) of the regulatory interaction, respectively. (C) A candidate protein target is scored based on the deviations in the expression of downstream genes from the PGN model prediction (P j : log 2 FC expression of protein j, G k : log 2 FC expression of gene k). The colored dots in the plots illustrate the log 2 FC data of a particular drug treatment, while the lines show the predicted expression of gene k by the (linear) PGN model. The variable z k denotes the z-score of the deviation of the expression of gene k from the PGN model prediction. A drug-induced enhancement of protein-gene regulatory interactions is indicated by a positive (negative) z k in the expression of genes that are activated (repressed) by the protein (i.e. a kj z k > 0). Vice versa, a drug-induced attenuation is indicated by a negative (positive) z k in the expression of genes that are activated (repressed) by the protein (i.e. a kj z k < 0). (D) The score of a candidate protein target is determined by combining the z-scores of the set of regulatory edges associated with the protein in the PGN. A positive (negative) score indicates a drug-induced enhancement (attenuation). The larger the magnitude of the score, the more consistent is the drug induced perturbations (enhancement/attenuation) on the protein-gene regulatory edges.","target":"Network perturbation analysis of gene transcriptional profiles reveals protein targets and mechanism of action of drugs and influenza A viral infection","rationale":"The title should be a description of the main components and key findings of the study.

I also apologize for the format since I'm on my phone and have spent several days trying to type this out. \\n\\nFor some context, I (22f) and my husband (24m) have been married for almost 4 years now, and together for 7. His cousin (25f) *was* my best friend in HS and is the whole reason we met.\\n\\nThis is where I probably should provide some backstory. Her parents were already older when they married and had her, so she grew up surrounded by hospitals and medical problems and never really had a childhood. She's an only child who was basically raised to care for her parents from the start, while battling many medical issues herself (she had scoliosis as a kid and it caused permanent nerve damage and she has rods in her back). Going to college was the only chance she ever had at an escape, and even that was ripped from her after her first year when her father was diagnosed with cancer. \\n\\nA few years later my husband and I found out that she and her father (her mother was in a nursing home at this point as her dimentia worsened and she stopped allowing help) were in a rough spot financially so we decided, since we were able, that we would take the opportunity to help out. A month later her father (my husband's uncle) passed away. \\n\\nUpon news of his passing, her landlord immediately evicted her from the only home she's known, leaving her only 30 days to gather all of her things by herself while her hoarding mother is screaming in her ear about every gadget and knick-knack she should save. My husband and I immediately took her in to our home as at this point we're her only living family and he feels responsible for her. \\n\\nThis is where it gets tricky. As previously mentioned, she's older than both of us, yet has absolutely 0 actual life skills. In the past year and a half she has lived with us, we have become her parents, while she barely lifts a finger. We coerced her into getting her first ever real job working maybe 15~ hours a week (we don't need her money, we're just trying to do what we can to get her on her feet), made her get her driver's permit (that she \\"loses\\" every time we ask if she wants to drive so she demands we drive her), and cover absolutely all of her living expenses except for her phone. I do her laundry unwillingly as she mixes it in our basket, wash all of the dishes, and do generally every single bit of the household cleaning, minus changing her cat's litter box as I'm allergic to them (I have photo evidence of huge piles of poop just sitting and rotting on the carpet in \\"her\\" room).

An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street.

If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\\n\\nLast week, I was walking down the street and I saw a man that I usually see on my way to work.

Ironically this literature-inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form. Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music. Did Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song? Certainly a cold-poem seems artistically repulsive. Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too. While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non-literary work.

Therefore, Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy were compared in 25 patients.

Scintigraphic measurements included normalized peak filling rate, time to normalized filling rate from both end-diastole and end-systole, diastolic time period and relative diastolic filling during early and atrial filling. Doppler echocardiography and scintigraphy compared favorably in assessment of fractional filling during early diastole (r = 0.84) and atrial systole (r = 0.85), ratio of early to atrial filling (r = 0.83), diastolic filling period (r = 0.94) and interval from end-diastole to peak early diastolic flow (r = 0.88). Normalized peak filling rate and time to normalized peak filling rate from end-systole did not correlate closely by these two techniques. The differences in normalized peak filling rate may be explained by difficulties in estimating mitral anulus cross-sectional area and left ventricular end-diastolic volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical values that describe peak velocity of the early diastolic filling wave, time to peak early diastolic velocity from both end-systole and end-diastole, integrated velocity (early, atrial and total), cross-sectional area of the mitral anulus, left ventricular end-diastolic volume and normalized peak filling rate.

Its economic strength and the accumulation of capital, led to prosperity and citizen happiness. On the other side of the river, Borania, however, decided to return to dictatorship and it's citizens and investors started to lose hope and move their capital to foreign accounts and investments.\\n\\nHint: Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence. Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength.\\n\\nThis leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country—depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime.\\n\\nThis fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also, their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire any form of foreign facilities, e.g. medical facilities.","target":"Borania","rationale":"Nirvania is described as developing economically and becoming a first world country.

Of the skills examined, the handspring vault produced the highest vertical and lateral impact forces, and the back handspring and back walkover required the greatest amounts of lumbar hyperextension.

The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.

Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's. After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options.

This was normally done by binding the ships on each side together, thus essentially fighting a land battle on the sea. However the fact that the losing side could not easily escape meant that battles tended to be hard and bloody. The Battle of Svolder is perhaps the most famous of these battles. As Arab power in the Mediterranean began to wane, the Italian trading towns of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice stepped in to seize the opportunity, setting up commercial networks and building navies to protect them. At first the navies fought with the Arabs , but then they found themselves contending with Normans moving into Sicily, and finally with each other. The Genoese and Venetians fought four naval wars, in 1253-1284, 1293-1299,1350-1355, and 1378-1381. The last ended with a decisive Venetian victory, giving it almost a century to enjoy Mediterranean trade domination before other European countries began expanding into the south and west. In the north of Europe, the near-continuous conflict between England and France was characterised by raids on coastal towns and ports along the coastlines and the securing of sea lanes to protect troop-carrying transports. The Battle of Dover in 1217, between a French fleet of 80 ships under Eustace the Monk and an English fleet of 40 under Hubert de Burgh, is notable as the first recorded battle using sailing ship tactics.

In particular, the potential for cocaine to precipitate life-threatening cardiac events needs to be reemphasized. We report the clinical and pathological findings in seven people in whom nonintravenous \\"recreational\\" use of cocaine was temporally related to acute myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, myocarditis, sudden death, or a combination of these events. We also review data on 19 previously reported cases of cocaine-related cardiovascular disorders. Analysis of all 26 patients indicated the following findings: the cardiac consequences of cocaine abuse are not unique to parenteral use of the drug, since nearly all the patients took the drug intranasally; underlying heart disease is not a prerequisite for cocaine-related cardiac disorders; seizure activity, a well-documented noncardiac complication of cocaine abuse, is neither a prerequisite for, nor an accompanying feature of, cardiac toxicity of cocaine; and the cardiac consequences of cocaine are not limited to massive doses of the drug. Although the pathogenesis of cardiac toxicity of cocaine remains incompletely defined, available circumstantial evidence suggests that cocaine has medical consequences that are equal in importance to its well-documented psychosocial consequences. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Acute cardiac events temporally related to cocaine abuse. option2: Observation of metabolites in the human brain by MR spectroscopy.","target":"Acute cardiac events temporally related to cocaine abuse","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that investigated the clinical and pathological findings in seven patients who experienced acute myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, myocarditis, sudden death, or some combination of these events following nonintravenous \\"recreational\\" use of cocaine.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably.

Switzerland is a founding member of the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referenda on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Austria","rationale":"The question asks when a country joined the European Union, and provides information about countries that are not in the EU.\\nThus, it is an elimination answer type of question where we have to find out which country among all four options DID join the EU circa 1995?

At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Electorate was enlarged to become a Kingdom with Hanover as its capital.\\n\\n- The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was established as a sovereign state on 1 January 1801 by the Acts of Union 1800, which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. The growing desire for an Irish Republic led to the Irish War of Independence, which resulted in Ireland seceding from the Union and forming the Irish Free State in 1922. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, and the state was consequently renamed the \\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\\".\\n\\n- The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. \\n\\n- Felt is a textile that is produced by matting, condensing and pressing fibers together.

Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).\\n\\n- The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) was formed in September 1972 by Donald Dell, Bob Briner, Jack Kramer, and Cliff Drysdale to protect the interests of male professional tennis players. Drysdale became the first President. Since 1990, the association has organized the worldwide tennis tour for men and linked the title of the tour with the organization's name. In 1990 the organization was called the ATP Tour, which was renamed in 2001 as just ATP and the tour being called ATP Tour. In 2009 the name was changed again and is now known as the ATP World Tour.

The Broncos jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes &#8212; a 3-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders and a 39-yarder to wide receiver Wes Welker. The 49ers got on the scoreboard midway through the second quarter, with a 22-yard field goal by placekicker Phil Dawson. On the Broncos' next possession, Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in career touchdown passes, with an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. The 49ers responded just before halftime, with a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Colin Kaepernick to wide receiver Steve Johnson, which narrowed the Broncos' lead to 21-10.

The ship, already shorthanded due to the death of a crew member before it left port, loses another (\\"the Greek\\") when he develops appendicitis. (Taking direction over the ship's radio, the captain is to perform the appendectomy, but he is unable to make the incision. Instead, Merriam successfully removes the sailor's appendix, but â feeling he should be loyal to the captain and spare him embarrassment â swears the radio operator to secrecy.

The captain says \\"You know, there are captains who might hold this against you, Louie.\\" Shortly after, the captain closes the hatch to the chain locker with Louie inside, and Louie is crushed to death by the chain.

He found that family dynamics   have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep.\\nAnd problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep.\\nThese add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious.\\nNow, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers.\\nClearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress.\\nQuestion: According to Maume's analysis, who will probably have a poor night's sleep?\\nYes or no, is the answer \\"Teens who lack a sense of security at school.\\"?","target":"No","rationale":"Teens who lack a sense of security at school are likely to have poor relationships with teachers.

This algorithm allows the user to preprocess arrays individually while retaining the advantages of multi-array preprocessing methods. The frozen parameter estimates required by this algorithm are generated using a large database of publicly available arrays. Curation of such a database and creation of the frozen parameter estimates is time-consuming; therefore, fRMA has only been implemented on the most widely used Affymetrix platforms.   \\n RESULTS We present an R package, frmaTools, that allows the user to quickly create his or her own frozen parameter vectors. We describe how this package fits into a preprocessing workflow and explore the size of the training dataset needed to generate reliable frozen parameter estimates. This is followed by a discussion of specific situations in which one might wish to create one's own fRMA implementation. For a few specific scenarios, we demonstrate that fRMA performs well even when a large database of arrays in unavailable.   \\n CONCLUSIONS By allowing the user to easily create his or her own fRMA implementation, the frmaTools package greatly increases the applicability of the fRMA algorithm. The frmaTools package is freely available as part of the Bioconductor project.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that provides a brief introduction to the background of the research (\\"A novel method of microarray preprocessing--Frozen Robust Multi-array Analysis (fRMA)--has recently been developed.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the results, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main conclusions (\\"We present an R package, frmaTools, that allows the user to quickly create his or her own frozen parameter vectors.

Passage 1:In 1944, Argentia served as one of the two stopover bases for the refuelling, maintenance, and crew changes of the six United States Navy (USN) K-class blimps that made the first transatlantic crossings of non-rigid airships. Blimps K-123 and K-130 from USN Blimp Squadron 14 (also known as ZP-14, Blimpron 14, or \\"The Africa Squadron\\") left South Weymouth Naval Air Station in Massachusetts on 28 May 1944 and landed at Argentia about 16 hours later. The two K-ships then flew for approximately 22 hours to Lages Field on Terceira Island in the Azores, the second stopover base for the transatlantic flights. The last leg was a ~20-hour flight to the squadron's final destination with Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 15 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco (now Kenitra, Morocco). Blimps K-123 and K-130 were followed by K-109 and K-134 then K-112 and K-101 which left South Weymouth on 11 and 27 June, respectively, in 1944. These six blimps initially conducted nighttime anti-submarine warfare operations to complement the daytime missions flown by FAW-15 aircraft (PBYs and PB4Y-2) using magnetic anomaly detection to locate U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar. Later, ZP-14 K-ships conducted minespotting and minesweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escort missions including that of the convoy carrying Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in early 1945. In late April 1945, K-89 and K-114 left NAS Weeksville (now Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City) in North Carolina and flew a southern route to NAS Bermuda, the Azores, and Port Lyautey, where they arrived on 1 May 1945.\\n Passage 2:The film opens before the declaration of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

As the siren goes, he sprints towards his MiG-21, armed, fuelled and ready for takeoff. Bajwa and his air force wingmen soon take off to an unknown airbase in Rajasthan. Once there, he is briefed by his superiors that he and his squadron are assigned to the Jaisalmer sector and have to fly the outdated and day fighter Hawker Hunter Ground attack planes (with no night vision capabilities) to support the Indian Army. He is soon joined by his brother-in-arms army Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri (Sunny Deol) as they meet on a courier flight and speak about the possibility of the opening of the Western front in light of the East Pakistan conflict. Kuldip takes up command of a company of the 23rd Battalion Punjab Regiment, arguing the light defence being assigned to the military post of Longewala. He meets his second-in-command 2nd Lieutenant Dharamveer Bhan (Akshaye Khanna) (who happens to be the son of a 1965 Indo-Pakistani War veteran who was killed during that war) and the Company JCO Naib Subedar Mathura Das (Sudesh Berry).

His eventual debut came at home against Aberdeen as he came off the bench to score his team's fifth goal in a 5–0 win, thus becoming an instant hit; the loud roar generated by the fans celebrating his goal blew out BBC Radio 5's microphones, who had been covering the game UK wide on radio, and they went off air for a short time until it was repaired.","target":"2","rationale":"Passage 2 contains the answer (WW2 lasted from 1939 to 1945)"},{"source":"Choose your answer from options.

The parliamentary historian Caroline Shenton has described the tally sticks as \\"roughly as long as the span of an index finger and thumb\\". These sticks were split in two so that the two sides to an agreement had a record of the situation. Once the purpose of each tally had come to an end, they were routinely destroyed. By the end of the eighteenth century the usefulness of the tally system had likewise come to an end, and a 1782 Act of Parliament stated that all records should be on paper, not tallies. The Act also abolished sinecure positions in the Exchequer, but a clause in the act ensured it could only take effect once the remaining sinecure-holders had died or retired. The final sinecure-holder died in 1826 and the act came into force, although it took until 1834 for the antiquated procedures to be replaced. The novelist Charles Dickens, in a speech to the Administrative Reform Association, described the retention of the tallies for so long as an \\"obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom\\"; he also mocked the bureaucratic steps needed to implement change from wood to paper. He said that \\"all the red tape in the country grew redder at the bare mention of this bold and original conception.\\" By the time the replacement process had finished there were two cart-loads of old tally sticks awaiting disposal.In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, received instructions from Treasury officials to clear the old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers.

That decision turned out to be shortsighted by Nickelodeon, and when proposed again to the then underutilized Disney Channel as a tie-in to the underperforming Hollywood Records (Disney Music Group), the concept proved inherently valuable enough that, as the complaint filed against Disney in 2007 in Los Angeles claimed, Rock and Roland was misappropriated by Disney and produced under the name Hannah Montana.

The current 'gold standard' antiplatelet agent clopidogrel has several pharmacological and clinical limitations that have prompted the search for more effective platelet antagonists. The candidates include various blockers of the purinergic P2Y12 receptor such as prasugrel, an oral irreversible thienopyridine; two adenosine triphosphate analogues that bind reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor: ticagrelor (oral) and cangrelor (intravenous); elinogrel, a direct-acting reversible P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (the only antiplatelet compound that can be administered both intravenously and orally); BX 667, an orally active and reversible small-molecule P2Y12 receptor antagonist; SCH 530348, SCH 205831, SCH 602539 and E5555, highly selective and orally active antagonists on the protease-activated receptor 1. A number of drugs also hit new targets: terutroban, an oral, selective and specific inhibitor of the thromboxane receptor; ARC1779, a second-generation, nuclease resistant aptamer which inhibits von Willebrand factor-dependent platelet aggregation; ALX-0081, a bivalent humanized nanobody targeting the GPIb binding site of von Willebrand factor and AJW200, an IgG4 monoclonal antibody of von Willebrand factor. The pharmacology and clinical profiles of new platelet antagonists indicate that they provide more consistent, more rapid and more potent platelet inhibition than agents currently used. Whether these potential advantages will translate into clinical advantages will require additional comparisons in properly powered, randomized, controlled trials..

Its economic strength and the accumulation of capital, led to prosperity and citizen happiness. On the other side of the river, Borania, however, decided to return to dictatorship and it's citizens and investors started to lose hope and move their capital to foreign accounts and investments.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich country has less confident citizens?\\n\\nHint: Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence. Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength.\\n\\nThis leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country—depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime.\\n\\nThis fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also, their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire any form of foreign facilities, e.g. medical facilities.","target":"Borania","rationale":"Given that capital flight is occurring in Borania, it can be assumed that the citizens of this country are losing hope and moving their assets to foreign accounts.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.","target":"Mary","rationale":"The question mentions plaques and cholesterol. Plaque is a deposit of fatty substances in the arteries that can hinder blood flow by clogging or narrowing the artery walls, while high levels of cholesterol are linked to plaque formation. \\nAs such, it would be reasonable to infer from this context that Mary has fewer plaques than Dan because she had normal levels of cholesterol as opposed to very high cholesterol like her husband did."},{"source":"Question: A big fountain was the center piece of the renovation, it had all been paid for by a grant to the what?\\n\\nChoices: \\n- city\\n- state\\n- front of casino\\n- rome\\n- public place\\n\\nThe rationale to choose \\"city\\" as the answer is that:","target":"a big fountain was the center piece of the renovation, it had all been paid for by a grant to the city","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"a big fountain was the center piece of the renovation, it had all been paid for by a grant to the city\\"."},{"source":"Given a comment, classify it into a 'hate' speech or 'not hate' speech.

Seen from the points of view of leaders such as Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Winfield Scott Hancock and Robert E. Lee, the film begins just after the attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, and culminates with the battle of Chancellorsville in May of 1863. Directed by Ronald F.

Congruent to the 1992 production of Gettysburg, Gods and Generals is of epic length with a final release running time of nearly four hours, having been trimmed from roughly six. The story opens just before the secession of Virgina and just after Lincoln had called for 75,000 troops to repel the rebellion. Robert E. Lee is offered and declines the command of Union forces. Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, an instructor at VMI during the secessionist takeover of the institute, commits himself to the defense of Virginia and is rapidly swept up in a leadership role of the fledgling Army of Northern Virginia.

Two plays later Brady threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Martin, which counted, and the Patriots led 7-0. The Texans reached the Patriots 20 on their ensuing drive, but were forced to settle for a 38-yard field goal by Nick Novak.

The 41-minute raga is dominated by the languid phrases of the violin that tests the border between melodic fragments and distorted tones.

A Pakistani businessman named Mohammed Atta had come to Prague from Saudi Arabia on May 31, 2000, with this second Atta possibly contributing to confusion. The Egyptian Mohamed Atta arrived at the Florenc bus terminal in Prague, from Germany, on June 2, 2000. He left Prague the next day, flying on Czech Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, U.S. In the Czech Republic, some intelligence officials say the source of the purported meeting was an Arab informant who approached the Czech intelligence service with his sighting of Atta only after Atta's photograph had appeared in newspapers all over the world. United States and Czech intelligence officials have since concluded that the person seen with Ani was mistakenly identified as Atta, and the consensus of investigators has concluded that Atta never attended a meeting in Prague.\\n Passage 3:UNICS has gone a long way towards helping Russian basketball since the club was established in 1991. Between 1994 and 1997, UNICS secured a berth in Russia's first division, and then made a smashing debut, establishing itself among the top five teams in the country. UNICS had already played in European competitions in 1997, but the new millennium happened to be a turning point for the club. The team placed second to CSKA in the Russian Basketball Super League in 2001 and 2002, the year in which it also reached the Saporta Cup semifinals, losing against the Greek club Maroussi in the semifinals. UNICS' first title was the Russian Cup in March 2003, with an electrifying 81–82 overtime victory over CSKA. UNICS' fans did not have to wait long to see their team win a European title, too. Kazan hosted the FIBA Europe League final four, which was eventually named the FIBA EuroChallenge, in April 2004, and UNICS made sure of its opportunity. UNICS signed Saulius Štombergas, Eurelijus Žukauskas, and Chris Anstey, and then won its regular season group, and advanced to the final four, which was held on its own floor, and where the club was crowned the FIBA Europe League champions. The MVP of the tournament's final four, Martin Müürsepp, scored 22 points, in an 87–63 win over Maroussi, in the title game. By the 2005–06 season, UNICS went one level up, and made its ULEB Cup (later named EuroCup) debut, where they tied the best regular season record in the competition's history. However, things turned south quickly, as UNICS lost at home against Roma, for the only time all season, in the tournament's eighth finals’ second leg, and crashed out earlier than expected. UNICS got stronger for the next season, keeping the core group of the previous season's side, while adding Darjuš Lavrinovič to reunite with his twin brother Kšyštof Lavrinovič, in a twin-towers set full of talent. The team made it to the ULEB Cup semifinals, before losing to the eventual league champs Real Madrid.

His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park.

He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000.\\n\\nWilliam Patrick Corgan Jr. was born at Columbus Hospital in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood on March 17, 1967 as the oldest son of William Corgan Sr., a blues/rock guitarist, and Martha Louise Maes Corgan Lutz. He was raised Catholic. His parents had one more son, Ricky, before divorcing in 1970. His father was soon remarried to a flight attendant, and Corgan and his brother went to live with them in Glendale Heights, Illinois. During this time, Corgan alleges he was subject to much physical and emotional abuse by his stepmother. Corgan also developed a protective bond with his younger paternal half-brother, who had special needs as a child. When Corgan's father and stepmother separated, all three boys would live alone with the stepmother, with both of Corgan's birth parents living separately within an hour's drive.  Corgan, who grew much faster than his fellow students, was a strong athlete in elementary school. In addition to being a member of his Marquardt Middle School baseball team, he collected baseball cards (amassing over 10,000) and listened to every Chicago Cubs game. However, by the time he began attending Glenbard North High School in Carol Stream, Illinois, he had become only an average athlete. He decided to start playing guitar when he went over to a friend's house and saw his friend's Flying V. Corgan gave his savings to his father, who bought him a used Les Paul knock-off. Corgan, Sr. steered his son stylistically, encouraging him to listen to Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix, but offered little other support, and the younger Corgan taught himself to play the instrument. His musical interests in his formative years included hard rock like Guts-era John Cale, heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath, and mainstream rock like Queen, Boston, ELO, Rush, and Cheap Trick. In high school, Corgan discovered alternative rock through Bauhaus and The Cure.  Corgan performed in a string of bands in high school, and graduated as an honor student. Despite grant and scholarship offers from a number of schools, and a tuition fund left by his grandmother, Corgan decided to pursue music full-time. Not finding the Chicago music scene to his liking, he moved from Chicago to St. Petersburg, Florida in 1985 with his first major band, The Marked (so named for the conspicuous birthmarks of both Corgan and drummer Ron Roesing). Not finding success in St. Petersburg, the band dissolved; Corgan moved back to Chicago to live with his father.

Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Rihanna, Beyoncé, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. \\"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.

According to another study , the Gross-functional product development teams, can achieve a great quality and better cost benefits from socializing and interacting with individuals who work for their suppliers.\\nThe first, Dr. Bohlmann's study analyzed cross-functional product development teams, which combine together engineers, researchers and business personnel. The point to involve people with various backgrounds was to show that there was a focus on finance, marketing, and also on a design and functionality, right from the start of the product-development process. In addition to all this, this diversity also helped to make communication more effective in order to ensure that all members of the team were socializing and cooperating, and not just working at cross-purposes.\\nAs a result, it indicated that \\"interactional fairness awareness\\" indeed had an effect on a \\"cross-functional communication.\\" In other words, all the team members who thought that they had been treated well and respected, showed a great increase in their commitment to the success of the project they had been working on in cooperation with other team members, and, in particular, when they realized their project manager or supervisor to be a kind, nice and honest guy.\\nAccording to Dr. Bohlmann, the increase in such commitment is very essential and important because it could improve performance that would result in the achievement of team goals. And if Bohlmann's study comes to the conclusion that nice and honest guys are the first to finish, the second research by Dr. Rob Handfleld shows us that cooperating and socializing well with others can give a team, and even a company an edge, when it comes...\\nQuestion: The best title for the passage might be   _  .\\nOptions: A: Team work is essential and important\\nB: How to develop a successful business career\\nC: Honest and kind people make better business career\\nD: Socializing and cooperating","target":"C","rationale":"The article is about the benefits of being honest and getting along well with colleagues in business.

He continued to score television series until the two then young directors, the Wachowskis, hired him to score their neo-noir film Bound. It was reasonably successful at the box office. Bound was the film which led Davis into becoming the composer for the entire Matrix trilogy.

For much of the picture's 114 minutes, the camera is on Joe Cocker, by most standards the best and most exciting singer in rock music ... But 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen,' unfortunately, fails in the end to rise above this interesting, but clearly limited historical summary of the Cocker tour.

H pylori infection increases intracellular calcium ion concentration [Ca2+]i of GECs, which induces APE-1 acetylation. We investigated the effects of H pylori infection and APE-1 acetylation on GEC apoptosis.   \\n METHODS AGS cells (wild-type or with suppressed APE-1), KATO III cells, and cells isolated from gastric biopsy specimens were infected with H pylori.

In GECs, expression of a form of APE-1 that could not be acetylated increased total and mitochondrial levels of Bax and induced release of cytochrome c and fragmentation of DNA; expression of wild-type APE-1 reduced these apoptotic events.

The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people.

Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool.

The psychologists wanted to see how many strangers would take the trouble to return them to the addresses listed on the drivers' licenses inside--but more than that, they wanted to find out what would make a person more likely to help out a stranger.\\nTo finish this, they included personal things in most of the wallets: some included a photo of a happy elderly couple, some contained a cute puppy, some contained a family portrait, and some held a photo of a lovely baby. Others had receipts  showing that the wallet's owner had recently donated to a charity . Some contained no personal details.\\nAs the psychologists soon discovered, the sight of a smiling baby is enough to warm nearly any heart: only one in ten of the strangers who _ such wallets did not return them. In contrast, the second most successful image, the puppy, had a 53% return rate. When the wallet included no photograph, it stood only a one in seven chance of being returned to the owner.\\nThe success of the baby photograph shows a human compassion  for the young that's been passed down through the ages, according to Dr. Wiseman. \\"The baby kicked off a caring feeling in people, which is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective ,\\" he told theTimes.\\nTo ensure our species' survival, scientists think that we must feel empathy and compassion for our young.

They often have me read from a kid’s bible and say prayers with them before bed.\\nI was raised Catholic but am agnostic now and I’m not big on the whole religion thing, but I have no problem doing this. I respect that it’s their religion and they have a right to raise their kids this way. Besides even though religion isn’t for me I still can appreciate its good qualities and recognize that prayer and faith in something bigger can be a beautiful thing.\\n\\nHowever, last night the parents said they had left the kid’s bible at their church last week and asked me to read from a Ken Ham kid’s book instead. It was called the Answers Book for Kids. I told them I would, not knowing what was inside. I didn’t know who Ken Ham was but I looked it up after reading some of the book- he’s the guy who thinks not only was there a literal flood that covered the earth but Noah actually took dinosaurs in the ark lmao. He built a giant ark in Kentucky and argued with Bill Nye and stuff.\\n\\nI started reading from a page in the book about where we came from. I was shocked how how the book misconstrued the theory of evolution and blatantly made things up. For example, the book said something along the lines of, “Some people want you to believe that we evolved from monkeys-how silly does that sound?” No. Just no. The theory proposes that humans and apes shared a common ancestor, NOT that we evolved from monkeys, and when you put it that way, it sounds just as silly as a giant guy up in the sky. I tried flipping through the pages to find a page suitable for children but all of them said some shit like how the earth was only 10000 years old, carbon dating is wrong, and dinosaurs existed with people. What 6 year old even knows what carbon dating is anyway. If you don’t believe me I think you can get a preview of the book on google books.\\n\\nAnyway, after flipping around the book a little I told the boys they could pick out a different picture book and we’d read that instead. I didn’t feel comfortable spreading harmful ideas into impressionable minds. Like I said I do not mind helping the boys pray or reading bible stories but this was just obvious propaganda and willful ignorance. \\n\\nWhen the parents got home they asked me if the boys said their prayers and read their book and I respectfully told them that I didn’t feel comfortable reading the book. Awkward silence ensued. I couldn’t tell if it was because they were pissed, or they were confused because they didn’t know what was in the book (which I thought might be the case since they seem like nice, intelligent people and I can’t imagine them teaching their kids those things.)\\n\\nI still feel really weird about it and maybe I should have just followed the parent’s instructions.

A pioneer in the ecology movement, Bookchin formulated and developed the theory of social ecology within anarchist, libertarian socialist, and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and ecology. Among the most important were Our Synthetic Environment (1962), Post-Scarcity Anarchism (1971) and The Ecology of Freedom (1982).\\n\\nBookchin was critical of class-centered analysis of Marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw as a more complex view of societies. In The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy, he says that:  My use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a \\"classless\\" or \\"libertarian\\" society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.  Bookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual psyche:  The objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure. Heinous as my view may be to modern Freudians, it is not the discipline of work but the discipline of rule that demands the repression of internal nature. This repression then extends outward to external nature as a mere object of rule and later of exploitation. This mentality permeates our individual psyches in a cumulative form up to the present day-not merely as capitalism but as the vast history of hierarchical society from its inception.\\n\\nwas this a book he had written?","target":"In The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy, he says that:","rationale":"The option \\"In The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy, he says that:\\" is obviously the correct answer."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a sentence and a question, you would be asked to create the answer which is contained in the sentence provided.\\n\\nSentence: Healthy lungs is necessary in a person who wishes to play wind instruments.

Both IGF-I and IGF-II are potent stimulators of amino acid uptake, cell proliferation, and differentiation; they also suppress protein degradation in these cells. In all measurements, the relative potencies are IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin. Two recombinant DNA-produced analogs of IGF-I, (Thr59)IGF-I and (N-Met)IGF-I, were as active as native IGF-I in all four assays. However, when 125I-labeled hormones were used for studies of binding to IGF receptors, there was a striking difference between the native and recombinant IGF-I molecules. Both were bound significantly by the type I receptor (a 350K molecule that is dissociated upon sulfhydryl reduction), but the recombinant analogs exhibited little cross-reactivity with the type II receptor (a 220K molecule that is not dissociated by reduction). Thus, the equal activity of native IGF-I and its recombinant DNA-produced analogs coupled with the higher potency of IGF-I (compared to IGF-II) suggest that the type II receptor plays little or no role in the four actions of the somatomedins studied in L6 myoblasts. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"Although the abstract does not include any direct numerical values, it does include a number of measurements (e.g., amino acid uptake, cell proliferation, and differentiation) that were used to assess the effects of different growth factors on muscle cells.

The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent. In 1999 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions.

Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he submitted a number of paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected outright or drew little attention when exhibited. In 1821 he finally achieved recognition when the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of his works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, beating John Constable to the position.Following the success of Cleopatra, over the next decade, Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in nude studies, and although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the full name of the successful painting that Etty tried to replicate by painting nude figures in biblical, literary, and mythological settings?","target":"The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia","rationale":"The full name of the successful painting that Etty tried to replicate by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings is \\"The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia\\".

After briefly recording with Sony BMG, Talbot was signed to Rainbow Recording Company, an offshoot of the label Rhythm Riders made specifically for her. To produce Over the Rainbow, Talbot worked with John Arnison, then-manager to Gabrielle and Billy Ocean, and Marc Marot, a former managing director of Island Records. It was produced and mixed by Simon Hill and Rob May. A recording schedule was worked out so that Talbot could continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as \\"a better solution\\" than the one offered by Sony BMG, \\"which has not robbed her of her childhood\\". Talbot said that \\"it was just amazing that we could do it in my auntie's house\\". Arnison and Marot asked the Talbot family to \\"write down a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party\\" to help choose the track listing, and then \\"thought long and hard\\" about including more adult songs on the album. Talbot herself insisted that they should.The final version of Over the Rainbow was recorded at Olympic Studios, on 12 October 2007.

Words and music are possibly based on an earlier lost secular Glückwunschkantate (congratulatory cantata). A printing of Franck's works contains a cantata for New Year's Day, Erschallet nun wieder, glückwünschende Lieder (Sound again, congratulating songs) that may have served as a model. The movement is in da capo form: the first section is repeated after a contrasting middle section. It is scored for three \\"choirs\\": one of trumpets, another of strings and bassoon, and a four-part chorus. The number three, symbolizing the Trinity, appears again in the 3/8 time signature and in the use of three trumpets. The first part opens with trumpet fanfares, alternating with flowing coloraturas in the strings. The voices enter as a third homophonic choir. They repeat the first measure of the fanfare motif on the word \\"Erschallet\\" (resound!), as the trumpets echo the motif. The voices repeat the motif from the second measure of the fanfare on \\"ihr Lieder\\", and the trumpets echo it again. The chorus repeats measures 3 and 4 on \\"erklinget, ihr Saiten\\", commanding the strings to play. As a culmination, the first syllable of \\"seligste Zeiten\\" (most blessed times) is held on a seventh chord (first in measure 53), during which the instruments play their motifs.In the middle section in A minor the trumpets rest while the other instruments play colla parte with the voices. Polyphonic imitation expands on the idea that God will prepare the souls to be his temples. The first sequence progresses from the lowest to the highest voice, with entrances after two or three measures. The highest voice begins the second sequence, and the other voices enter in closer succession, one or two measures apart. Gardiner interprets the polyphony as \\"conjuring before us the elegant tracery of those 'temples' which God promises to make of our souls\\".

One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\\n\\n- The Fourth Crusade (120204) was a Western European armed expedition called by Pope Innocent III, originally intended to conquer Muslim-controlled Jerusalem by means of an invasion through Egypt.

The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires.

During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe.

The refrain that ends each of the main verses—\\"Honey, why are you so hard?\\"—is a double entendre Dylan had been wanting to work into a song.\\n\\"Absolutely Sweet Marie\\"This song, described as \\"up-tempo blues shuffle, pure Memphis\\" and an example of \\"obvious pop sensibility and compulsive melody\\", was recorded in four takes on March 7, 1966. Gill sees the lyrics as a series of sexual metaphors, including \\"beating on my trumpet\\" and keys to locked gates, many deriving from traditional blues. Nonetheless, the song contains what has been termed \\"one of the most oft-repeated of Dylan's life lessons\\", the thought that \\"to live outside the law you must be honest\\", which was later invoked in many bohemian and counter-cultural contexts.\\n\\"4th Time Around\\"When The Beatles released their sixth studio album, Rubber Soul, in December 1965, John Lennon's song \\"Norwegian Wood\\" attracted attention for the way in which Lennon disguised his account of an illicit affair in cryptic, Dylanesque language.

Bay village race took place on the shores of the nearby bay, while Hill race took place on the hills and valleys 10 miles away. Bay village race competitors experienced bad weather: a thunderstorm took place during the first hour of the competition.\\n\\nand a hint : In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]\\n\\nDescending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which race had more cyclists experiencing a higher risk of loss of control?","target":"Hill","rationale":"The Bay race took place during a thunderstorm, which is bad weather.

Carl Wayne Anderson is a homeless, deaf-mute Vietnam veteran accused of murdering Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department. Kathleen Riley is the beleaguered Federal Public Defender assigned to represent Anderson. An agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger, is made a member of the jury and begins investigating the details of the murder himself, eventually teaming up with Riley to solve the case. We see some early scenes of Sanger's work as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, including his efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman. While not relevant to the movie's plot, these scenes are establishing shots giving us a sense for Sanger as a charming, though somewhat ruthless, person.The movie begins around Christmas with the suicide of a United States Supreme Court Justice, for which no explanation or context is given. We only see the Justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly after the Justice's suicide, Elizabeth Quinn's body is found floating in the Potomac river, and Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was found sleeping in Quinn's car, which was abandoned in the parking lot where she worked (and was mostly deserted at night). Anderson explains that he found it unlocked and was just looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was found in Quinn's car, he was arrested for her murder.

When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price.

Rolling Stone writer Greil Marcus asked \\"What is this shit?\\" on first listening to Self Portrait, released in June 1970. It was a double LP including few original songs, and was poorly received. In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, considered a return to form. This album included \\"Day of the Locusts\\", a song in which Dylan gave an account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970. In November 1968, Dylan had co-written \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" with George Harrison; Harrison recorded \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" and Dylan's \\"If Not for You\\" for his 1970 solo triple album All Things Must Pass. Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh attracted media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock, a small studio in Greenwich Village, to record with Leon Russell. These sessions resulted in \\"Watching the River Flow\\" and a new recording of \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\".

He attended Wabash College, but transferred to the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1839. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Infantry and served as the regimental adjutant. Although often referred to as Edward Canby, a biographer has suggested that he was known as \\"Richard\\" during childhood and to some friends for most of his life.\\n\\nIn August 1872, Canby was posted to command the Pacific Northwest. He soon faced problems with the Modoc tribe, who had traditionally lived in Northern California. Forced to remove to a reservation in Oregon which they had to share with their traditional enemies, the Klamath tribe, they had pleaded with the US government to return to California. When the US refused, the Modoc left the reservation and returned illegally. In 1872, the US Army went to fight against them to force them back and the Modoc War broke out. The Modoc, entrenched in Captain Jack's Stronghold south of Tule Lake, resisted army attacks and fought US forces to a stalemate.  General Canby had received conflicting orders from Washington as to whether to make peace or war on the Modoc. As war was not working, the US government authorized a peace commission and assigned Canby a key position on it. There were many lines of communication between the Modoc and whites. At one point, someone told the Modoc leader Captain Jack that the governor of Oregon intended to hang nine Modoc, apparently without trial, as soon as they surrendered. The Modoc broke off scheduled talks; Canby was angered by the rumors and their action, as he believed that his federal authority trumped the governor's and made the threat irrelevant. Canby had no intention of allowing the Modoc to be punished without a trial.  On April 11, 1873, after months of false starts and aborted meetings, Canby went to another parley, unarmed and with some hope of final resolution. Judge Elijah Steele of Yreka, California wrote later that when he warned Canby that the Modoc were volatile and he was at risk, Canby replied, \\"I believe you are right, Mr. Steele, and I shall regard your advice, but it would not be very well for the general in command to be afraid to go where the peace commissioners would venture.\\" The peace talks were held midway between the army encampment and Captain Jack's stronghold near Tule Lake. It was discovered later that two members of Canby's party brought concealed weapons and Modoc warriors were also armed.  According to Jeff C. Riddle, the Modoc son of the US interpreter and the author of Indian History of the Modoc War (1914), the Modoc had plotted before the meeting to kill Canby and the other commissioners, as they believed peace was not possible. They were determined to \\"fight until we die.\\" (He was the son of Winema and Frank Riddle.) Captain Jack had been reluctant to agree to the killings, believing it \\"coward's work\\", but was pressured by other warriors to agree. He insisted on being given another chance to ask Canby to \\"give us a home in our country.\\" When Canby said he did not have the authority to make such a promise, Captain Jack attacked the general. With Ellen's Man, one of his lieutenants, he shot Canby twice in the head and cut his throat. The Modoc also killed Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a peace commissioner, and wounded others in the party. Canby was the only general to be killed during the Indian Wars.\\n\\nWhen did he die?","target":"1914","rationale":"The answer is not 1914. The only date mentioned in the context is 1873 which seems to be more relevant than 1914 (that's 41 years later!)\\nCanby was killed by Captain Jack who had previously been reluctant about killing him because it would have been \\"coward's work\\". \\nSo, we can infer that he died sometime before April 11th of 1873."},{"source":"I gave my students this multiple choice question: DNA stores the genetic instructions transferred from one generation to the next.

Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance.

KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money.

His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons.

Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown.  In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months.

Ultraviolet radiation has enough energy to damage DNA which makes it unsuitable for use in studying living cells or tissues from inside of organisms' bodies without causing harm to them. \\n\\n\\nTherefore, among these 4 alternatives only X-Rays can pass through parts of humans' bodies and be utilized for this purpose so it should be selected."},{"source":"Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.\\n\\nAbstract: Accurate localization of the source of androgen hypersecretion is critical to the appropriate surgical or medical management of women with virilization. Seven patients with virilization and hyperandrogenism of various causes were evaluated with the use of sequential studies: testosterone stimulation and suppression tests; computerized tomography (CT); selective venous catheterization; and 131I-iodomethyl-norcholesterol (NP-59) scintigraphy. Comparison of the diagnostic accuracies of these localization studies with the ultimate diagnoses in this group of virilized women showed that: endocrinologic suppression/stimulation studies are of limited value in tumor localization and helpful only in patients with steroidogenic enzyme deficiencies; both selective catheterization and CT scanning may provide spurious localization data; and NP-59 scintigraphy, by depicting both the anatomic localization and functional androgen hypersecretion, may provide the most significant localization data in the evaluation of patients with virilizing syndromes. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data, such as the measurements of androgen levels in patients with virilization, which plays a key role in identifying the cause of virilization.

Eggplant! And no, it has nothing to do with chickens! This strangely named vegetable is, however, as _ as an egg. It can be steamed, fried or baked. It can be eaten by itself or combined with meats and other vegetables.\\nEggplant was first grown in India during the 5th century B.C. Its popularity soon spread to China and then throughout Asia. Finally, during the Middle Ages the vegetable made its way to Europe. At that time, eggplant was not the shiny purple vegetable most people know today. Instead, it was like a white egg. Due to this egg-like appearance, eggplant got its name. In its early days, the vegetable was so bitter that people often called it a \\"mad apple\\". This nickname started because people believed its bitterness was bad for one's health. People actually thought eggplant could cause insanity  and cancer.\\nFortunately, today people know that eggplant doesn't cause insanity or cancer. In fact, eggplant is so healthy that it may prevent cancer. In addition, the brain and the heart benefit from this supper vegetable. Since it is high in fiber, eggplant can also improve digestion.\\nItaly, Turkey, Egypt, China and Japan are the leading growers of eggplant in the world today. Depending on its location, eggplant may be purple, green, orange or yellow-white. And it can be as small as a tomato or as large as a cucumber. Dish diversities  range from simple to complex, with all of them being delicious!\\nToday, thousands of people are gathering in Loomis, Calif, for the 23rd annual Loomis Eggplant Festival. The main activity at the festival is eating delicious eggplant dishes. There is plenty more to do and see, though. Recipe contests, arts and crafts, performers, races and children's activities all \\"egg-cite\\" festival-goers.

Mike learned about  biology while Dan learned more about the weather. They both were among the best in the school.\\n\\nand a hint : Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming.

In practice, this means that by fixing the identity portion of latent codes, we can generate diverse images of the same subject, and by fixing the observation portion we can traverse the manifold of subjects while maintaining contingent aspects such as lighting and pose. Our algorithm features a pairwise training scheme in which each sample from the generator consists of two images with a common identity code. Corresponding samples from the real dataset consist of two distinct photographs of the same subject. In order to fool the discriminator, the generator must produce images that are both photorealistic, distinct, and appear to depict the same person.

The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.\\nAlthough the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population.

The current lineup consists of lead vocalist Chibi, rhythm guitarist Rainbow, lead guitarist Falcore, drummer Rhim, keyboardist Owen, and bassist Nate Manor. When the band formed in 1999, they were known as Imagica. This name was inspired from the fantasy novel Imajica (1991) by Clive Barker.\\n\\nThe group originated in London, Ontario, under the name Imagica, with members using pseudonyms and nicknames instead of their birth names. The group's original lineup formed when Rainbow met Chibi at Fanshawe College, studying in the same fine-arts program. The two decided to start a band for fun as they were already hanging around writing music together. Rainbow recruited childhood friend Michael Falcore to join on guitar since they had already been recording music together in high school. Aslan, who was also attending the same college, became roommates with Rainbow and joined on bass. In mid 2000, Dank, a long-time friend of Chibi's, joined to play live keyboards but left the group shortly before they relocated to Toronto.  After months of rehearsals and writing songs, they played their first gig on October 28, 2000, at Diversity night club in London. The band released a seven-song limited-edition demo CD at the show which had been recorded on a four-track cassette recorder during a time when the group was recording cover songs for fun. There were 40 hand-numbered copies of the demo which included the first recorded version of the song \\"The Birthday Massacre\\" (later renamed \\"Happy Birthday\\").  During this time, the band also met Rhim, Owen and Brett Carruthers who all attended the same college. In addition to this, later in October 2006, Terry McManus, Professor of Music Business and Entertainment Law at Fanshawe College, would join as the band's personal manager.  Since its inception, The Birthday Massacre have described the band as an audio-visual project. In a 2009 interview, when asked about why they had started the band, Rainbow stated: \\"I think more than just being a band, it's a way to sort of incorporate, not just music, but other things. So I think more so than just music, the idea of having a band, and being able to perform, and being able to do artwork, to do music... all these different avenues.\\" Neither Rainbow, Chibi nor Michael Falcore had been in any previous bands and have expressed in multiple interviews that the group formed naturally as a result of spending time together as friends.  On July 20, 2004, the Birthday Massacre again independently released an EP, Violet, and at the end of the year, re-released Nothing with new sleeve artwork. In the fall of 2004, Kai Schmidt, former member of electronic group Funker Vogt, signed the band to his label in Germany. They released a remastered and expanded LP version of Violet in Europe, including updated album art in a Digipak case. Adm left the band shortly before signing to Repo Records and can be seen in the original group photo on the nine song EP but is absent in the Digipak and LP version. In 2004, Brett Carruthers briefly joined the band on live keyboards. 2004 saw the band touring outside of Canada for the first time, playing the states of New York, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland performing with American bands 51 Peg, Deadstar Assembly, Celldweller and Crossbreed.  In 2005, the band signed to Metropolis Records and re-released Violet. In August, the band began a series of international tours taking them to Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Hungary, Czech Republic, Belgium, Spain and UK. Also in August the band released a DVD with the video for Blue by Dan Ouellette. Owen joined on keyboards first assuming the name Waffles, then O-en, then finally using his given name. Owen previously met the Birthday Massacre when playing in another band called Electric Knife Fight and joined just after the Blue filming was completed and therefore missed making an appearance in the video. On New Year's Eve the band performed in Los Angeles, California, at Bar Sinister.  In early 2006, the Birthday Massacre toured North America, playing across Canada, the United States and Mexico on their \\"Broken Minds\\" tour sharing the stage with KMFDM, Schoolyard Heroes, Suicide City and the Start. They toured Europe again with bands Das Ich, Jesus on Extasy and Dope Stars Inc; playing in France, Italy, and Poland's Castle Party 2006. Through its European debut, Violet ranked high in the alternative charts. In several countries, the band made it onto the front pages of magazines; performing at some of Germany's largest music festivals, including the annual Highfeild and M'era Luna summer festivals. Also in 2006 the band recorded a remix of the song \\"Straight to Video\\" by Mindless Self Indulgence. Later in 2008, the band would record a second remix, this time of the song Never Wanted to Dance with the addition of Chibi's vocals.  On January 1, 2007, a demo version of the song \\"Kill the Lights\\" was released for streaming on the band's Vampirefreaks profile, which remained for several years the number one ranked profile for the highest number of listeners. In June, the band announced it was working on a new record with Canadian producer and engineer Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie and that Aslan was leaving to start a new project and that O.E would be returning to the lineup on bass duties. In August, the band began planning a new video to be directed again by Dan Ouellette.  On September 11, 2007, the band released Walking with Strangers in North America, entering at No. 10 on the Billboard \\"Top Heatseekers\\" chart for September 29. The album was released in Europe on September 21 and in the UK on 22 October. Artwork was created by JUNO Award winner, Vincent Marcone of Johnny Hollow. In October and November, the band toured Europe and the U.K with German band Psycho Luna.  Primary filming of the Looking Glass video took place February 10-11, 2008, directed by Ouellette. Extras were culled from The Birthday Massacre's fan base and all 35 masks were handcrafted. The Looking Glass video was released on the band's official YouTube channel on April 1, 2008, and distributed as a video data file on the EP which was released in May 2008. It contained several remixes by electronic artists such as Dean Garcia, Jamie Miller and Dave Ogilvie. Beginning in June, the band embarked on a large American tour, opening up for Mindless Self Indulgence, and sharing shows with Julien-K, Fake Shark - Real Zombie!, London After Midnight and Combichrist. They would further tour America with bands Tub Ring, Hollowboy and Creature Feature. November 2008 also saw the band touring Australia for the first time.  On May 5, 2009, the band released their Show And Tell CD, featuring 16 live tracks from their show in Hamburg, Germany, filmed at Knust, which occurred during their Walking With Strangers Tour in 2007. The DVD portion of the show was released on October 2, 2009, in Europe and in North America on February 9, 2010. During the summer of 2009, Chibi recorded vocals for former WWE Diva Katie Lea Burchill's entrance theme, \\"Hurt You\\".  During the spring and summer of 2009, the band went on tour with bands I Am Ghost and Dommin in both North America and Europe. In late July 2009, the band was featured on a contest called 'Book The Band', at Virgin Mobile Festival, which took place online and allowed fans to vote repeatedly. On August 17, The Birthday Massacre was declared winner of the contest and was given 100 tickets to hand out to the most fanatic voters. They performed at the festival on August 30, 2009, held at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. Chibi stated in an interview, that since the band is unable to write while touring, the band took a year off to write and record a new album.

But he was still obsessed with computers and spent as much time in the computer laboratories as he did in the lecture halls.\\nBy 1975, Gates and a partner, Paul Allen, had developed a software program called BASIC.

Although he had not completed his degree, Gates left university and went to work full time for the new company he had formed called Microsoft.\\nHis next project was the software program that made him famous and very rich. It was called DOS, short for Disk Operating System, and it was purchased by IBM in 1980.

The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year.

The setting then changes to the present day, where Deloris (now going by the surname Van Cartier) is a lounge singer in a 1960s-themed act called The Ronelles (a parody of The Ronettes), who sing at The Moonlite Lounge of the Nevada Club in Reno, Nevada, run by her boyfriend, the mobster Vince LaRocca. After Deloris walks in on Vince having his chauffeur Ernie executed for betrayal, Vince orders his two henchmen Joey and Willy to kill her as well. Deloris flees Vince's casino to the local police station where Lieutenant Eddie Souther suggests she testify against Vince if he can be arrested and tried, but for now, she should go into witness protection until the time comes.\\nDeloris is taken to St. Katherine's Parish in a seedy, run-down neighborhood of San Francisco, where Souther suggests she take refuge in the attached convent. Both Deloris and the stoic Reverend Mother object, but are convinced by Souther and Monsignor O'Hara to go ahead with it. Deloris 'becomes' a nun   habit and all   under the hand of Reverend Mother, who gives her the religious name 'Sister Mary Clarence' to complete the disguise. Mary Clarence objects to following the strictures and simple life of the convent, but comes to befriend several of the nuns, including the forever jolly Sister Mary Patrick, quiet and meek Sister Mary Robert, and the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus. After sneaking into a nearby bar, Mary Clarence is chastised by Reverend Mother and put into the choir, which she has seen to be dreadful. The choir nuns, learning that Mary Clarence has a background in music, elect her to take over as choir director, which she accepts, and she rearranges them to make them better singers. At Mass one Sunday, the choir sings the \\"Hail Holy Queen\\" in the traditional manner beautifully before shifting into a gospel and rock-and-roll-infused performance of the hymn.\\nReverend Mother is infuriated with Mary Clarence about the performance, and orders that Mary Lazarus once again become the leader the choir, but Monsignor O'Hara is thrilled with the performance as the unorthodox music brought people, including teenagers, in off the streets. Deloris convinces Monsignor O'Hara that the nuns should be going out to clean up the neighborhood. This they do, and the choir wows church visitors with their music, with Souther eventually attending a performance of \\"My Guy\\" (appropriately rewritten as \\"My God\\"). Eventually, O'Hara announces to the choir that Pope John Paul II is to visit the church to see the choir himself. Reverend Mother decides to hand in her resignation since her authority has been unintentionally undermined, but Mary Clarence offers to leave in her stead, to which the Reverend Mother disagrees.\\nDetective Tate, a police officer on Vince's payroll, finds out where Deloris is and contacts Vince, who sends Joey and Willy out to grab her. Souther confronts Tate, gets him arrested, and flies to San Francisco to try and warn Mary Clarence, but Vince's men abduct her.\\nThe nuns, led by the Reverend Mother, risk their lives by going to Reno to save Mary Clarence. Meanwhile, she flees Vince and his men, leading to a chase around the casino until the nuns find her and try to sneak out. Vince, Joey and Willy confront the nuns, but they are unable to bring themselves to shoot Deloris while she is in a nun's habit, and Reverend Mother proclaims Deloris is indeed a nun, to convince Vince. As Vince works up the courage to shoot her anyway, Souther bursts in and shoots him in the arm, and has the men arrested. Reverend Mother then thanks Deloris for everything she has done for them and agrees to remain at the convent.\\nThe film ends with the choir, led by Deloris, singing \\"I Will Follow Him\\" before the Pope and a packed and refurbished St. Katherine's, earning a loud standing ovation from the audience, the Pope, Reverend Mother, Monsignor O'Hara and Lt. Souther. The end credits reveals that Deloris' secret life as a nun was sold to the media and has become a sensation. The ending of Deloris' \\"career\\" as a choir leader is revealed through magazines and album covers and Deloris has continued leading the choir as a famous group with published albums.","target":"Who is the good cop trying to help Deloris?","rationale":"The story clearly explains that there is a good cop trying to help Deloris.

Both types of cells exhibit elevated permeabilities to sodium and potassium, in the case of sickle cells, when deoxygenated. The ouabain-insensitive fluxes of sodium and potassium were equivalent, however, in both cell types under these conditions. When incubated 18 hours in vitro, sickle cells lost cations but only when deoxygenated. This cation depletion was blocked by ouabain, removal of external potassium, or pretreatment with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, which blocks the increase in cation permeability induced by deoxygenation. The loss of cation exhibited by oxygenated xerocytes similarly incubated was also blocked by ouabain. These data support the hypothesis that the elevated \\"passive\\" cation fluxes of xerocytes and deoxygenated sickle cells are not directly responsible for cation depletion of these cells; rather, these pathologic leaks interact with the sodium pump to produce a net loss of cellular cation. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"Numerical data that supports the hypothesis are provided in the abstract.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.\\n\\nand the situation: Two botanists studied different types of plants.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it.

This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art.

I think rediscovering it probably will give you a total-body exercise.\\nAlthough considered an excellent form of exercise, jumping rope has never been widely accepted because of two reasons. First, most people consider jumping rope to be an excellent form of cardiovascular   exercise, but they also believe that it is simply too difficult. In other words, they don't think they'll be able to continue jumping for the near 20 minutes in order to achieve a beneficial physical effect. Second, many  people regard it as a little boring and overly repetitive --not as something fun or enjoyable.\\n _ . Instead of doing the usual two-foot bounce  over and over again, players good at rope-jumping often change their pattern every 10 or 20 jumps. A single bounce, a double -bounce, a skip, a knee-up, side swings, as well as a variety of other easy-to-learn free-style rope-jumping .\\nNowadays researchers are discovering that jumping rope also prepares the brain for learning. It is an exercise allowing both brain hemispheres to perform equally to each other . In a word, jumping rope can be a life-long activity requiring little equipment, time and space, yet leading to a much healthier life.\\nQuestion: According to the researchers, jumping rope  _  .\\n- only prepares the brain for learning\\n- is suitable for students only\\n- helps both brain hemispheres work together\\n- can be dangerous for old people","target":"helps both brain hemispheres work together","rationale":"The article is about the benefits of jumping rope. The author first mentions that it can be a total-body exercise, and then outlines some reasons why people might avoid this activity: they think it's too difficult or boring.\\nIn order to make jumping rope more enjoyable, the writer suggests changing up your routine every 10-20 jumps instead of doing just one type over and over again. This section ends with \\"A single bounce, a double -bounce, a skip...\\" These examples imply that there are many ways to jump rope beyond simply using two feet at once (\\"the usual two-foot bounce\\"). \\nAt the end of the article, researchers have discovered that not only does jumping rope help you stay fit physically but also helps both brain hemispheres work together --it even prepares"},{"source":"In this task, you will be shown a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending.

However, the largest wave of Armenian refugees - some of whom had come before and returned - were the nearly 9,000 who escaped the massive deportations, the horrific massacres and the Genocide perpetrated by the Ottomans and the Young Turks; about 1,300 of them decided to stay, while the others eventually made arrangements to settle in other countries.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us?\\nI believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday.\\nWithin my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’.

The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.\\nQuestion: Who stated that how we spend our days is how we spend our lives?\\nOptions:\\n- Joe Johnson\\n- Steven Harold\\n- not enough information\\n- Anne Dillard","target":"Anne Dillard","rationale":"The context mentions a quote by \\"Annie Dillard\\" that states “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”.

Hours ago Louise had been safely landed at the East Orange house and placed in the care of old Madame Cerise, who would guard her like an ogre.

Arguing from his own stand-point he realized that the friends of Louise were by this time using every endeavor to locate her. They would not succeed in this, he was positive. His plot had been so audacious and all clews so cleverly destroyed or covered up that the most skillful detective, knowing he had abducted the girl; would be completely baffled in an attempt to find her. \\nQuestion: Who did Charlie believe were trying and failing to find Louise? \\nIs the correct answer Mershone?","target":"No","rationale":"Who did Charlie believe were trying and failing to find Louise? \\nThe question asks for the subject of \\"his\\" plot, which refers back to Mershone.

In this paper we show that prevalent attention architectures do not adequately model the dependence among the attention and output tokens across a predicted sequence.\\n We present an alternative architecture called  Posterior Attention Models that after a principled factorization of the full joint distribution of the attention and output variables, proposes two major changes.   First, the position where attention is marginalized is changed from the input to the output. Second, the attention propagated to the next decoding stage is a posterior attention distribution conditioned on the output.

But there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever.
