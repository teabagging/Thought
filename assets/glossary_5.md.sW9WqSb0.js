Here we consider how multihost parasite transmission and evolutionary dynamics may affect the success of human and animal disease control programmes, particularly neglected diseases of the developing world. We review the different types of zoonotic interactions that occur, both ecological and evolutionary, their potential relevance for current human control activities, and make suggestions for the development of an empirical evidence base and theoretical framework to better understand and predict the outcome of such interactions. In particular, we consider whether preventive chemotherapy, the current mainstay of NTD control, can be successful without a One Health approach. Transmission within and between animal reservoirs and humans can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences, driving the evolution and establishment of drug resistance, as well as providing selective pressures for spill-over, host switching, hybridizations and introgressions between animal and human parasites. Our aim here is to highlight the importance of both elucidating disease ecology, including identifying key hosts and tailoring control effort accordingly, and understanding parasite evolution, such as precisely how infectious agents may respond and adapt to anthropogenic change. Both elements are essential if we are to alleviate disease risks from NZDs in humans, domestic animals and wildlife. Adamo, S., and J. P. Webster 2013.

Because of the extremely high rate of kidnappings in Mexico City for ransoms, wealthy businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) hires Creasy through Rayburn to guard his nine-year-old daughter \\"Pita\\" (Dakota Fanning). Samuel however is having money problems, and intends to keep Creasy on only long enough to satisfy the requirements to renew his kidnap and ransom insurance on Pita. Creasy suffers from alcoholism, depression and severe guilt as a result of his former black ops work. Drinking heavily, Creasy attempts suicide with his pistol, but the bullet fails to fire when he pulls the trigger. He calls Rayburn, who says that \\"a bullet always tells the truth.\\" At first Creasy distances himself from Pita, but soon he becomes a surrogate father to the girl, allowing him to stop drinking and find a purpose in his life.\\nWhile Creasy is escorting Pita to her piano lesson, a group of gunmen try to kidnap her. Creasy kills four of the kidnappers, including two corrupt policemen, in a shoot out, but he is shot multiple times and collapses from his wounds, and the abductors escape with Pita. Creasy is hospitalized but is moved to a veterinary hospital by Miguel Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini), an agent of the Agencia Federal de InvestigaciÃ³n (AFI), who suspects Creasy will be killed by rogue police.

When a warm air mass meets a cold air mass, they don't mix as they have different densities (a bit like oil and water). Instead, the warm less dense air is pushed up over the cold dense air creating the 'front'. Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Describe how does precipitation occur and what determines the type of precipitation that falls to Earth? Precipitation occurs due to the immense collection of water vapor in the form of clouds. When the water vapor in these clouds gets too heavy, it falls. Rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation: 1  Light rain — when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm (0.098 in) per hour. 2  Moderate rain — when the precipitation rate is between 2.5 mm (0.098 in) - 7.6 mm (0.30 in) or 10 mm (0.39 in) per hour. Rain & Floods How does rain form? Water droplets form from warm air. As the warm air rises in the sky it cools. Water vapor (invisible water in the air) always exists in our air. Warm air holds quite a bit of water. For example, in the summer it is usually very humid. When enough of these droplets collect together, we see them as clouds. Most of the condensed water in clouds does not fall as precipitation because their fall speed is not large enough to overcome updrafts which support the clouds. For precipitation to happen, first tiny water droplets must condense on even tinier dust, salt, or smoke particles, which act as a nucleus. Precipitation - Measurement. 1  The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100 mm (4 in) plastic and 200 mm (8 in) metal varieties. [74] 2  Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.

Prior to his cabinet position, he was a candidate for President of the United States in the Republican primaries in 2016. Born in Detroit, Michigan, and a graduate of Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School, Carson has authored numerous books on his medical career and political stances.\\nContext: By ninth grade, the family's financial situation had improved, his mother surprising neighbors by paying cash to buy a new Chrysler car, and the only government assistance they still relied on was food stamps. Carson attended the predominantly black Southwestern High School for ninth through 12th grades, graduating third in his class academically. In high school he played the baritone horn in the band, and participated in forensics (public speaking), chess club, and the U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) program where he reached its highest rank--cadet colonel. Carson served as a laboratory assistant in the high school's biology, chemistry, physics school laboratories beginning in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, respectively, and worked as a biology laboratory assistant at Wayne State University the summer between 11th and 12th grades.  In his book Gifted Hands, Carson relates that as a youth he had a violent temper. \\"As a teenager, I would go after people with rocks, and bricks, and baseball bats, and hammers,\\" Carson told NBC's Meet the Press in October 2015. He said he once tried to hit his mother on the head with a hammer over a clothing dispute, while in the ninth grade he tried to stab a friend who had changed the radio station. Fortunately, the blade broke in his friend's belt buckle. Carson said that the intended victim, whose identity he wants to protect, was a classmate, a friend, or a close relative. After this incident, Carson said that he began reading the Book of Proverbs and applying verses on anger. As a result, he states he \\"never had another problem with temper\\". In his various books and at campaign events, he repeated these stories and said he once attacked a schoolmate with a combination lock. Nine friends, classmates, and neighbors who grew up with him told CNN in 2015 they did not remember the anger or violence he has described. In response, Carson posted on Facebook a 1997 Parade Magazine issue, in which his mother verified the stabbing incident. He then questioned the extent of the effort CNN had exerted in the investigation.  He has said that he protected white students in a biology lab after a race riot broke out at his high school in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. The Wall Street Journal confirmed the riot but could not find anyone who remembered Carson sheltering white students.\\nQuestion: Did Ben Carson attend high school?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Carson attended the predominantly black Southwestern High School for ninth through 12th grades,","rationale":"In the context, it is mentioned that Carson attended Southwestern High School in ninth grade and graduated third academically.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the late 20th century. Glass's work has been described as minimal music, having similar qualities to other \\"minimalist\\" composers such as La Monte Young, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley. However, Glass has instead described himself as a composer of \\"music with repetitive structures\\", which he has helped evolve stylistically.\\n\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Glass's lyrical and romantic styles peaked with a variety of projects: operas, theatre and film scores (Martin Scorsese's Kundun, 1997, Godfrey Reggio's Naqoyqatsi, 2002, and Stephen Daldry's The Hours, 2002), a series of five concerts, and three symphonies centered on orchestra-singer and orchestra-chorus interplay. Two symphonies, Symphony No. 5 \\"Choral\\" (1999) and Symphony No. 7 \\"Toltec\\" (2004), and the song cycle Songs of Milarepa (1997) have a meditative theme. The operatic Symphony No. 6 Plutonian Ode (2002) for soprano and orchestra was commissioned by the Brucknerhaus, Linz, and Carnegie Hall in celebration of Glass's sixty-fifth birthday, and developed from Glass's collaboration with Allen Ginsberg (poet, piano - Ginsberg, Glass), based on his poem of the same name.  Besides writing for the concert hall, Glass continued his ongoing operatic series with adaptions from literary texts: The Marriages of Zones 3, 4 and 5 ([1997] story-libretto by Doris Lessing), In the Penal Colony (2000, after the story by Franz Kafka), and the chamber opera The Sound of a Voice (2003, with David Henry Hwang), which features the Pipa, performed by Wu Man at its premiere. Glass also collaborated again with the co-author of Einstein on the Beach, Robert Wilson, on Monsters of Grace (1998), and created a biographic opera on the life of astronomer Galileo Galilei (2001).  In the early 2000s, Glass started a series of five concerti with the Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (2000, premiered by Dennis Russell Davies as conductor and soloist), and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra (2000, for the timpanist Jonathan Haas). The Concerto for Cello and Orchestra (2001) had its premiere performance in Beijing, featuring cellist Julian Lloyd Webber; it was composed in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. These concertos were followed by the concise and rigorously neo-baroque Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra (2002), demonstrating in its transparent, chamber orchestral textures Glass's classical technique, evocative in the \\"improvisatory chords\\" of its beginning a toccata of Froberger or Frescobaldi, and 18th century music. Two years later, the concerti series continued with Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark (2004), composed for the pianist Paul Barnes. The concerto celebrates the pioneers' trek across North America, and the second movement features a duet for piano and Native American flute. With the chamber opera The Sound of a Voice, Glass's Piano Concerto No. 2 might be regarded as bridging his traditional compositions and his more popular excursions to World Music, also found in Orion (also composed in 2004).

Passage:The episode was written by Nell Scovell and directed by Wes Archer. In the episode, Bart and Lisa sneak into the sushi bar's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft, \\"Theme from Shaft\\". The Fox network censors originally did not want the staff to use the song because they thought the lyrics were too obscene for television. In order to prove the censors wrong and show that it could appear on television, the staff dug up footage from an old Academy Awards ceremony at which the song was performed by Isaac Hayes. When the chef at the sushi bar finds out Homer has been poisoned, he yells at his apprentices in Japanese. The staff wanted the language they spoke to be actual Japanese, so they hired a Japanese actor who translated the lines for them. The episode introduced the character Akira, who has appeared many times later on the show. American actor George Takei provided the voice of Akira, although the character was voiced in later episodes by Hank Azaria. The episode featured many other guest appearances; Larry King as himself; Sab Shimono as the sushi bar chef; Joey Miyashima as Toshiro, the apprentice chef who slices up the fugu; and Diane Tanaka as hostess of the bar. King's role was first offered to American singer Bruce Springsteen, but he turned it down. According to showrunner Sam Simon, actor William Shatner also rejected the part.\\n Links: a.

One response to cold is shivering, which is random muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to generate heat. When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop significantly, red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of ATP production. This lack of oxygen can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death. The body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent blood from cooling there and so that the body’s core can stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains stable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers and toes, can develop frostbite when blood flow to the extremities has been much reduced.

Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases.

On April 12, 1961, the USSR surprised the world again by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single orbit around the Earth in a craft they called Vostok 1. They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut, roughly translated from Russian and Greek as \\"sailor of the universe\\". Although he had the ability to take over manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer, it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution; medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space. Vostok 1 orbited the Earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the Soviet Union, with Gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7,000 meters (23,000 ft), and landing by parachute. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (International Federation of Aeronautics) credited Gagarin with the world's first human space flight, although their qualifying rules for aeronautical records at the time required pilots to take off and land with their craft. For this reason, the Soviet Union omitted from their FAI submission the fact that Gagarin did not land with his capsule. When the FAI filing for Gherman Titov's second Vostok flight in August 1961 disclosed the ejection landing technique, the FAI committee decided to investigate, and concluded that the technological accomplishment of human spaceflight lay in the safe launch, orbiting, and return, rather than the manner of landing, and so revised their rules accordingly, keeping Gagarin's and Titov's records intact.\\",\\n\\nanswer the following question.

Passage:In the 1970s, astronomers saw some major advances in astronomical imaging technology, beginning with Antoine Labeyrie's invention of speckle interferometry, a process that significantly reduced the blurring effect caused by astronomical seeing. It increased the optical resolution of ground-based telescopes, allowing for more precise measurements of Betelgeuse's photosphere. With improvements in infrared telescopy atop Mount Wilson, Mount Locke and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, astrophysicists began peering into the complex circumstellar shells surrounding the supergiant, causing them to suspect the presence of huge gas bubbles resulting from convection. But it was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Betelgeuse became a regular target for aperture masking interferometry, that breakthroughs occurred in visible-light and infrared imaging. Pioneered by John E. Baldwin and colleagues of the Cavendish Astrophysics Group, the new technique employed a small mask with several holes in the telescope pupil plane, converting the aperture into an ad-hoc interferometric array. The technique contributed some of the most accurate measurements of Betelgeuse while revealing bright spots on the star's photosphere. These were the first optical and infrared images of a stellar disk other than the Sun, taken first from ground-based interferometers and later from higher-resolution observations of the COAST telescope. The \\"bright patches\\" or \\"hotspots\\" observed with these instruments appeared to corroborate a theory put forth by Schwarzschild decades earlier of massive convection cells dominating the stellar surface.","target":"a","rationale":"The passage provides information about when the technology was invented, and this can be used to answer the question about when the technology was used at Mount Wilson, Mount Locke, and Mauna Kea."},{"source":"In this task you will be given a text passage from a trivia quiz.

Formed in 1990, the group's line-up includes drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist since 1995, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.\\n\\nThe following year, at a time when alternative rock and grunge was at its height, Tool released their first full-length album, Undertow (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than Opiate and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound. The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology, which was perceived as a clash with \\"the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being.\\" Keenan \\"spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience.\\"  Tool later played several concerts during the Lollapalooza festival tour, and were moved from the second stage to the main stage by their manager and the festival co-founder Ted Gardner. At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown Los Angeles, comedian Bill Hicks introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in Undertow's liner notes. He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens. The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped Undertow to be certified gold by the RIAA in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995, despite being sold with a censored album cover by distributors such as Wal-Mart. The single \\"Sober\\" became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band Billboard's \\"Best Video by a New Artist\\" award for the accompanying stop motion music video.  With the release of Tool's follow-up single \\"Prison Sex\\", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: \\"It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open.\\" The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his \\"surrealistic interpretation\\" of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as \\"metaphoric\\", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.  In September 1995, the band started writing and recording their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. Justin Chancellor, a member of former tourmates Peach, eventually replaced D'Amour, having been chosen over competitors such as Kyuss's Scott Reeder, Filter's Frank Cavanaugh, Pigmy Love Circus's E.

Grand Teton National Park covers approximately 310,000 acres (130,000 ha), while the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway includes 23,700 acres (9,600 ha).  Most of the Jackson Hole valley and virtually all the major mountain peaks of the Teton Range are within the park. The Jedediah Smith Wilderness of Caribou-Targhee National Forest lies along the western boundary and includes the western slopes of the Teton Range. To the northeast and east lie the Teton Wilderness and Gros Ventre Wilderness of Bridger-Teton National Forest. The National Elk Refuge is to the southeast, and migrating herds of elk winter there. Privately owned land borders the park to the south and southwest. Grand Teton National Park, along with Yellowstone National Park, surrounding National Forests and related protected areas constitute the 18,000,000-acre (7,300,000 ha) (28,000 sq mi (73,000 km2)) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem spans across portions of three states and is one of the largest intact mid-latitude ecosystems remaining on Earth.

If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Michael lives near a cliff overlooking the sea.

This causes everything in his environment look less bright, thereby making him unable to see his shadow (because no direct radiation is reaching him), since all available rays have been scattered by dust particles or clouds in the sky above at different angles into other directions away from its original path so they can't reach their destination directly)."},{"source":"Being stronger has what impact on a creatures health?\\n\\nWhich is the correct answer?\\n- bad impact\\n- unexpected complications\\n- minimum effect\\n- good influence","target":"good influence","rationale":"Being stronger generally has a positive influence on an organism's health, as it makes them more resistant to diseases and capable of withstanding injury.

At 17, his father tired to persuade him not to become a mathematician because he may lead a poor life being a mathematician, and so von Neumann agreed to study chemistry as well. In 1926, at 23, he received a degree in chemical engineering and a Ph.D. in mathematics. From then on, mathematics provided well enough for him, and he never had to turn to chemistry.\\nIn 1930, von Neumann visited Princeton University for a year and then became a professor there. His first book was published in 1932. In 1933, the Institute for Advanced Study was formed, and he became one of the 6 full-time people in the School of Mathematics(Einstein was one of the others)\\nWorld War II hugely changed von Neumann's areas of interest. Until 1940 he had been a great pure mathematician. During and after the war, he became one of the best mathematicians who put mathematics theories into practice. During the last part of the war he became interested in computing machines and made several fundamental contributions After the war, von Neumann continued his work with computers, and was generally very active in government service. He received many awards, was president of the American Mathematical Society and was a member of the Atomic Energy Commission. He died in 1957 of cancer.\\nVon Neumann made several great contributions and any one of them would have been enough to earn him a firm place in history. He will be remembered as one of the greatest minds of the 20th century.\\nVon Neumann really was a legend in his own time, and there are a number of stories about him.

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back.

This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background. The mosaics include no human figures, which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones.\\nI had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium.\\nThe counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed.

It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “\\nI suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness.

In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, \\"His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'.\\" They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes \\"cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning\\". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with \\"an eye on Mein Kampf\\". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, \\"proving both that it is not just the early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator\\".Vikernes himself has connected the church burnings to an idea of resurgent Viking paganism. The first such burning, that of Fantoft Church on June 6, 1992, was thought by many to be related to Satanism, since the burning occurred on the sixth day of the week, on day six of the sixth month and was thus a reference to the Number of the Beast.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.

Although it does not explicitly mention the removal or movement of these outer layers to a new location, we can infer from this sentence that their original position near the outside surface of the red giant was changed during this process. So although they were originally in close proximity to each other, both entities are now in different places.

Outside their window, the queen's seamstress, Constance Bonacieux, stands watching the conversation between the two characters, when she is attacked by Rochefort, one of the Cardinal's loyal men. She is rescued by the young musketeer d'Artagnan and taken away to his abode, where Constance briefly explains her troubles and asks for d'Artagnan's help.\\nCardinal Richelieu, wanting to convince King Louis XIII that his wife, the queen, is unfaithful to him and in love with the Duke of Buckingham, suggests that he should ask his wife to wear the diamonds he had given her for an upcoming ball. The queen, shocked and dismayed, confesses to Constance that she had sent the diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham, and her confidant goes to d'Artagnan for help. With the help of his companions, three of the finest musketeers in France, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, d'Artagnan makes his way to England to seek the Duke himself, so that he may recover the diamonds and restore the queen's honor.\\nStill, when all problems seem overcome, the English Duke of Buckingham plans to invade France, remove King Louis XIII and marry the queen; on the other hand, Cardinal Richelieu and Milady want revenge on d'Artagnan and Buckingham. Milady orders Rochefort to kidnap Constance Bonacieux, and when d'Artagnan learns this he sets off to rescue her. Milady is captured by Buckingham, and orders Felton to guard her. Felton falls in love with Milady; she seduces him and asks him to murder the Duke, which he does. Though she believes herself safe at a convent, Constance receives a visit from her supposed benefactor, Milady de Winter, who poisons her; d'Artagnan arrives at the scene and she dies in his arms.

It was co-written by Marc, Todd and the latter's then-girlfriend, Johanna Pigott; and had Mansfield producing. Soon after Mansfield joined Dragon on keyboards and as a songwriter.  In June 1984 the group's next album, Body and the Beat, which was produced by Mansfield and Carey Taylor, was released and peaked at No. 5. The group provided \\"a much fuller, more rock-oriented sound... [it] was a polished, contemporary sounding Adult Oriented Rock rock album.\\" After a tour in support of the album, Hewson left to return to New Zealand, he died of a heroin overdose in January 1985.

The line-up of Hunter, Borich, Paul Christie on bass guitar (ex-Mondo Rock), Richard Harvey on drums (ex-Divinyls) and Joe Walsh on guitar and lead vocals (of the Eagles), recorded that group's fourth live album, You Need Professional Help (1985), during the tour.

The moral choices along with Batmans personal struggles all draw you in.  The tone of the movie is dark and it hardly ever comes out of that even in the end but there is a little light.  I was never a big fan of Heath Ledger or his movies but I have to say I think now I am gonna miss him.  I really had no idea of how talented he really was until I got to the end of the movie and said \\"Wow\\".  Though he is not even recognizable I found the Joker to be one of the best played out characters of all time. I did notice that at certain moments though intentional or not when Batman was not Bruce Wayne he talked in this weird throaty voice which I guess might of been intentional but sounded weird.  The movie left me a lot of room to really think about Batmans struggle and the way he handles himself in those situations to either be a hero or slowly turn to being a villain.  The choices and decisions that are before Batman presented by the Joker are just so well played and so well thought out the eventual solutions Batman takes and the results all play nicely together.  I did like the fact this movie did not have a whole bunch of CG and everything revolved more around the human element and the reasoning of human nature.  Don't get me wrong CG is not bad but this movie had a lot more going for it than pretty effects.  I do wish Two Face had a bigger role and I figured when I heard certain phrases close to the beginning of the movie I figured they would repeat later as some sort of lesson or something.  I found the ending to be relatively weak and kinda came to a quick end after yet another moral choice brought by Two Face.  Though some parts I found predictable this is far by my favorite superhero movie of all time and to great to be missed.\\nquestion: What kind of things happen in this movie?","target":"This is basically my favorite superhero","rationale":"The question asks \\"what kind of things happen\\" in the movie.

At the end of the 2002 season, Lucchino appointed Epstein to replace interim general manager (GM) Mike Port. Epstein is credited with initiating the trade of Nomar Garciaparra and making key contract acquisitions including those of Kevin Millar and Curt Schilling during his first tenure as Red Sox GM. The new players were regarded as instrumental in breaking the so-called \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" when the Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. It was the Red Sox' first World Series championship since 1918, ending what remains the third longest championship drought in the history of any Major League team, after the Chicago White Sox (1917-2005) and the Chicago Cubs (1908-2016).  On October 31, 2005, Epstein resigned, rejecting a three-year, $1.5-million-per-year contract for personal reasons. According to The Boston Globe, \\"This is a job you have to give your whole heart and soul to\\", he said. \\"In the end, after a long period of reflection about myself and the program, I decided I could no longer put my whole heart and soul into it.\\" Because it was Halloween the night he resigned from the Red Sox, Epstein left Fenway Park wearing a gorilla suit in an attempt to avoid reporters. A witness reported spotting a person wearing a gorilla suit driving a Volvo similar to Epstein's that night. The suit was loaned to him and was later auctioned for $11,000. The money raised was given to The Jimmy Fund and the Foundation to be Named Later (FTBNL).  Epstein remained in contact with the team's front office and on January 12, 2006, he and Red Sox management announced his return. Six days later, the team announced that he would resume the title of general manager and add the title of executive vice president. In November 2007, Epstein announced, at the annual general manager meeting, that he had signed a new contract with the Red Sox but declined to disclose the terms of the deal.  In December 2007, Epstein was mentioned in the Mitchell Report regarding a November 2006 email exchange he had had with Red Sox scout Marc DelPiano on the possible acquisition of closer Eric Gagne. In the email, Epstein asked DelPiano, \\"Have you done any digging on Gagne? I know the Dodgers think he was a steroid guy. Maybe so. What do you hear on his medical?\\" DelPiano replied that \\"steroids IS the issue\\" with Gagne, questioned his \\"poise and commitment\\" and expressed questions about his durability \\"without steroid help.\\" Despite DelPiano's reservations about Gagne, Epstein traded Kason Gabbard and minor league outfielders David Murphy and Engel Beltre to the Texas Rangers for Gagne on July 31, 2007.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"What role did he play with the Red Sox?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Red Sox","rationale":"The context states that Lucchino became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Red Sox.

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared.

Kicker John Carney would provide the scoring for the rest of the game, as he kicked two second-quarter field goals (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder), and one third-quarter field goal (a 20-yarder) to essentially wrap up the game.  From there, the Saints defense continued to put pressure on Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, as they sacked him five times, while limiting the running duo of Vick and Dunn to just a combined total of 101 rushing yards.  With their dominating performance, the Saints would take the lead in the NFC South with a surprising 3-0 record.

The style was defined primarily by the deep basslines and \\"squelching\\" sounds of the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.\\n\\n- Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.\\n\\n- Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.\\n\\n- The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- Breakbeat as a term refers to one of two distinct things. Originally it would have referred only to \\"A breakbeat\\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except for the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \\"Breakbeat\\" (2), characterized as a genre of groove-oriented music which utilizes a lo-fi sampled breakbeat (or combination of breakbeats) for the main drum beat, and usually incorporates other lo-fi sampled \\"hits\\" as well.\\n\\n- Palm Pictures is a US-based entertainment company owned and run by Chris Blackwell. Palm Pictures produces, acquires and distributes music and film projects with a particular focus on the DVD-Video format.

Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as \\"English-speaking blacks from Barbados\\" like Grandmaster Flash, \\"black Jamaicans\\" like DJ Kool Herc, \\"thousands of Nuyoricans\\", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify.\\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'divine operating system' with the relationship of 'record label'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- english\\n - funk\\n - island\\n - label\\n - melody\\n - palm pictures\\n - pop\\n - united kingdom","target":"palm pictures","rationale":"The entity of 'divine operating system' has the relationship of 'record label', which is associated with a record company that produces and distributes phonograph records.\\nAfter reading, we can find out that only \\"palm pictures\\" in choices are related to music industry.

The absorption of injected epinephrine was variable and in several cases very slow. The individual maximum values for epinephrine in plasma were 4.65 +/- 1.09 (range 0.74 to 8.31) nmol/L, and these maxima were attained 5 to 120 minutes after injection. Inhaled epinephrine was rapidly and dose dependently absorbed. Ten inhalations resulted in 2.72 +/- 0.84 (0.75 to 5.67) nmol/L within 5 minutes and 20 inhalations resulted in 7.19 +/- 1.78 (2.10 to 13.83) nmol/L with rapid increases and maxima within 20 minutes in seven of eight subjects. Gastrointestinal side effects were dose limiting when epinephrine was administered by inhalation. Our results indicate that inhalation of 2 to 3 mg of epinephrine produces rapid increases of epinephrine concentrations in plasma to levels that have previously been demonstrated to counteract bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled allergen in subjects with asthma. Inhalation has several advantages over injection for self-administration of epinephrine, e.g., in patients who are allergic to insect (Hymenoptera) stings. Apart from the absorption being more rapid, the locally high concentrations of epinephrine in the airways should be advantageous, since bronchoconstriction is one of the life-threatening phenomena of the anaphylactic reaction. This route of administration is also simple for the patient. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Case Report 2)Diagnosis, Differential 3)Electromyography","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that compares the effects of subcutaneous epinephrine injection and inhalation on plasma concentrations in healthy subjects.

Every person perceives himself to have a sort of invisible shield surrounding his physical body. When someone comes too close, he feels uncomfortable. When he bumps onto someone, he feels obligated to apologize. But the size of a person's \\"comfort zone\\" depends on his cultural ethnic origin. For example, in casual conversation, many Americans stand about four feet apart. In other words, they like to keep each other \\"at arm's length\\", people in Latin or Arab cultures, in contrast, stand very close to each other, and touch each other often. If someone from one of those cultures stands too close to an American while in conversation, the American may feel uncomfortable and back away.\\nWhen Americans are talking, they expect others to respond to what they are saying. To Americans, polite conversationalists empathize by displaying expressions of excitement or disgust, shock or sadness. People with a \\"poker face\\", whose emotions are hidden by a deadpan expression, are looked upon with suspicion. Americans also indicate their attentiveness in a conversation by raising their eyebrows, nodding, smiling politely and maintaining good eye contact. Whereas some cultures view direct eye contact as impolite or threatening, Americans see it as a sign of genuineness and honesty. If a person doesn't look you in the eye, American might say, you should question his motives--or assume that he doesn't like you.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing.

Often, agents are asked to perform in environments where data is difficult to obtain.

In this battle, King Olaf II of Norway  was killed. During the pontificate of Pope Alexander III, the Roman Catholic Church  declared Olaf a saint in 1164. His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada, was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place. He became King of Norway in 1047, only to die in a failed invasion of England at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. The authenticity of the battle as a historical event is subject to question. Contemporary sources say the king was murdered. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle of 1030, Olaf was killed by his own people. Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070 that Olaf was killed in an ambush, and so did Florence of Worcester in 1100. Those are the only contemporary sources that mention the death of the king. After the king's canonization it was felt that the saint could not have died in such circumstances.  The story of the Battle of Stiklestad as we know it gradually developed during the two centuries following the death of King Olaf. Saint Olaf must have fallen in a major battle for Christianity.\\nAnswer this question: How many years old was Harald Hardrada when he died?","target":"51","rationale":"The goal of this problem is to figure out how many years old was Harald Hardrada when he died. First, we need to check his age in the Battle of Stiklestad and then calculate 51 - 15 = 36. Since it's said that \\"He became King of Norway in 1047\\", adding one year later would be 37 since after becoming a king around 1048, which means from 1047-1066 there are 19 more years until death should also be added as 37 + 19 = 56; however, it's mentioned that \\"[Harald] was only fifteen\\". Therefore we could conclude that 51 (his death) - 15 (born) = 36 actual number"},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- Botswana , officially the Republic of Botswana, is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa.

The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.\\n\\nand a hint : A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin.

Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless.

A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than $25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- $3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

Ideas of inventions that change society or, at least, make life easier for somebody? Perhaps we all do sometimes, but we don't often make the idea a reality.

That same year, Big Feathers was commissioned for the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane. It comprises two large feather-shaped forms suspended above the pedestrian precinct, representing \\"Queen Street's history of parades as well as the mall's connection between earth and sky\\".In 2000, Oliver's piece Entwine was a finalist in the inaugural Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award, while in the following year, Oliver won the University of New South Wales inaugural sculpture commission competition, with her three-metre-high Globe. Other success followed, when Trace was selected for the National Gallery of Australia's 2002 National Sculpture Prize exhibition.In August 2002 she was one of five artists shortlisted by the Australian Government for a project to produce a public artwork celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia.By the 2000s most of Oliver's output constituted commissioned pieces, whether public or private.

Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District. Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma.\\n\\nWatts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma to J. C. \\"Buddy\\" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992). His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader, the first black police officer in Eufaula, and a member of the Eufaula City Council. His mother was a homemaker. Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood. He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.  While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal. Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.  He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship. In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.  Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories. Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism. Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game. He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.  Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993. He is a teetotaler. Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office. Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race. Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles. Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him. Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990 for a six-year term as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.

Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52 of the intended 120 spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940. By then the decline in the population of the City of London had reduced the congregation to less than 80, and the parishes of St Leonard, Foster Lane and Christ Church Greyfriars were merged with nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.St Botolph's Aldersgate remains open as a functioning church. Unusually for an English church, because of its location in a now mainly commercial area with few local residents, services are held on Tuesdays instead of the more traditional Sundays.

During his life, he worked as a poet, essayist, journalist, translator, professor, and publisher. He was very politically active, and is considered an important revolutionary philosopher and political theorist. Through his writings and political activity, he became a symbol of Cuba's bid for independence against Spain in the 19th century, and is referred to as the \\"Apostle of Cuban Independence.\\"\\n\\nJanuary 12, 1895, the North American authorities stopped the steamship Lagonda and two other suspicious ships, Amadis, and Baracoa at the Fernandina port in Florida, confiscating weapons and ruining Plan de Fernandina (Fernandina Plan). On January 29, Marti drew up the order of the uprising, signing it with general Jose Maria Rodriguez and Enrique Collazo. Juan Gualberto Gomez was assigned to orchestrate war preparations for La Habana Province, and was able to work right under the noses of the relatively unconcerned Spanish authorities. Marti decided to move to Montecristi, Dominican Republic to join Maximo Gomez and to plan out the uprising.  The uprising finally took place on February 24, 1895. A month later, Marti and Maximo Gomez declared the Manifesto de Montecristi, an \\"exposition of the purposes and principles of the Cuban revolution\\". Marti had persuaded Gomez to lead an expedition into Cuba.  Before leaving for Cuba, Marti wrote his \\"literary will\\" on April 1, 1895, leaving his personal papers and manuscripts to Gonzalo de Quesada, with instructions for editing. Knowing that the majority of his writing in newspapers in Honduras, Uruguay, and Chile would disappear over time, Marti instructed Quesada to arrange his papers in volumes. The volumes were to be arranged in the following way: volumes one and two, North Americas; volume three, Hispanic Americas; volume four, North American Scenes; volume five, Books about the Americas (this included both North and South America); volume six, Literature, education and painting. Another volume included his poetry.  The expedition, composed of Marti, Gomez, Angel Guerra, Francisco Borreo, Cesar Salas and Marcos del Rosario, left Montecristi for Cuba on April 1, 1895. Despite delays and desertion by some members, they got to Cuba. They landed at Playitas, near Cape Maisi and Imias, Cuba, on April 11. Once there, they made contact with the Cuban rebels, who were headed by the Maceo brothers, and started fighting against Spanish troops. The revolt did not go as planned, \\"mainly because the call to revolution received no immediate, spontaneous support from the masses.\\" By May 13, the expedition reached Dos Rios. On May 19, Gomez faced Ximenez de Sandoval's troops and ordered Marti to stay rearguard, but Marti separated from the bulk of the Cuban forces, and entered the Spanish line.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"José Martí","rationale":"The entity that the text is about is José Martí.\\nJosé Julián Martí Pérez was a Cuban National Hero and an important figure in Latin American literature.

Adept as a central defender or a left back, he received his maiden call into the first team squad for a First Division league match against Bradford City on 5 April 2003 and was an unused substitute during the 1–0 win. Craig made his professional debut with a starting appearance in a 3–3 draw with Nottingham Forest on 26 April 2003 and lasted 67 minutes before being substituted for Robbie Ryan. He started in the final game of the 2002–03 season at home to Coventry City and scored the first senior goal of his career in the 2–0 win, with the opener on 51 minutes. Craig began the 2003–04 season as a virtual ever-present, making 10 appearances, but he dropped out of the squad entirely in October 2003. He was again out of favour with manager Dennis Wise during the 2004–05 season and had to wait until 19 February 2005 for his first appearance, which came with a start in a 1–0 defeat to Stoke City and he finished the campaign with 10 appearances.\\n Passage 2:While 1776 had started well for the American cause with the evacuation of British troops from Boston in March, the defense of New York City had gone quite poorly. British general William Howe had landed troops on Long Island in August and had pushed George Washington's Continental Army completely out of New York by mid-November, when he captured the remaining troops on Manhattan. The main British troops returned to New York for the winter season. They left mainly Hessian troops in New Jersey. These troops were under the command of Colonel Rall and Colonel Von Donop. They were ordered to small outposts in and around Trenton. Howe then sent troops under the command of Charles Cornwallis across the Hudson River into New Jersey and chased Washington across New Jersey. Washington's army was shrinking, due to expiring enlistments and desertions, and suffered from poor morale, due to the defeats in the New York area. Most of Washington's army crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania north of Trenton, New Jersey, and destroyed or moved to the western shore all boats for miles in both directions. Cornwallis (under Howe's command), rather than attempting to immediately chase Washington further, established a chain of outposts from New Brunswick to Burlington, including one at Bordentown and one at Trenton, and ordered his troops into winter quarters. The British were happy to end the campaign season when they were ordered to winter quarters. This was a time for the generals to regroup, re-supply, and strategize for the upcoming campaign season the following spring.\\n Passage 3:Maryland Route 12 (MD 12) is a state highway on the Eastern Shore in the U.S. state of Maryland.

He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln.\\n\\nTheodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at East 20th Street in New York City. He was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister, Anna (nicknamed \\"Bamie\\"), a younger brother, Elliott, and a younger sister, Corinne. Elliott was later the father of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Theodore's distant cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent; his other ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. Theodore Sr. was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \\"C.V.S.\\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill. Theodore's fourth cousin, James Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mittie was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P. \\"Patsy\\" Stewart. Through the Van Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the Schuyler family.  Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma. He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the \\"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History\\". Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for display. At age nine, he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled \\"The Natural History of Insects\\".  Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent leader in New York's cultural affairs; he helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the Civil War, even though his in-laws included Confederate leaders. Roosevelt said, \\"My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.\\" Family trips abroad, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Where was Roosevelt born?","target":"East 20th Street in New York City.","rationale":"The answer to the question can be found in this part of the context:\\n\\n\\"Roosevelt was born on October 27, 1858, at East 20th Street in New York City.

I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work!\\nIt was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared?\\nThe next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us.\\nWill a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?\\nAre we pointing fingers at ourselves?\\nIn the end, we are all in the same team.\\nQuestion: Why were the people kicking off the stones?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. not enough information\\n\\nB.

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\\n\\n- Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a Gram - positive , non-motile bacterium that plays an important role in the creation of Emmental cheese , and to some extent , Jarlsberg cheese , Leerdammer and Maasdam cheese . Its concentration in Swiss - type cheeses is higher than in any other cheese . Propionibacteria are commonly found in milk and dairy products , though they have also been extracted from soil . P. freudenreichii has a circular chromosome about 2.5 Mb long . When Emmental cheese is being produced , P. freudenreichii ferments lactate to form acetate , propionate , and carbon dioxide ( 3 C3H6O3  2 C2H5CO2 + C2H3O2 + CO2 ) . The products of this fermentation contribute to the nutty and sweet flavors of the cheese , and the carbon dioxide byproduct is responsible for forming the holes , or \`\` eyes '' in the cheese . Cheesemakers control the size of the holes by changing the acidity , temperature , and curing time of the mixture . An estimated one billion living cells of P. freudenreichii are present in one gram of Emmental . In contrast to most lactic acid bacteria , this bacterium mainly breaks down lipids , forming free fatty acids . Recent research has focused on possible benefits incurred from consuming P. freudenreichii , which are thought to cleanse the gastrointestinal tract . P. freudenreichii has also been suggested to possibly lower the incidence of colon cancer . This mutualistic relationship is unusual in propionibacteria , which are largely commensal . The performance and growth of P. freudenreichii is highly dependent on the presence of Lactobacillus helveticus , which provides essential amino acids . The degradation of L. helvecticus releases a variety of amino acids and peptides . While P. freudenreichii has been found to grow even in the absence of L. helvecticus , some strains of the bacteria were observed lysing in the absence of glutamine , lysine , or tyrosine . The autolysis of P. freudenreichii has been suggested to contribute further to the flavor of the Emmental cheese .

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.\\n\\n- Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth. This naturally occurring chemical compound is made up of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, in ice caps and glaciers and also in seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas.\\n\\n- Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.\\n\\n- In chemistry, a carbonate is a salt of carbonic acid (HCO), characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion, . The name may also mean an ester of carbonic acid, an organic compound containing the carbonate group C(=O)(O).\\n\\n- Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.\\n\\n- In chemistry, esters are chemical compounds derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an Oalkyl (alkoxy) group. Usually, esters are derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Glycerides, which are fatty acid esters of glycerol, are important esters in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids, and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in essential oils and pheromones. Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules. Nitrate esters, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties, while polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties.\\n\\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- Lactose is a disaccharide sugar composed of galactose and glucose that is found in milk. Lactose makes up around 28% of milk (by weight), although the amount varies among species and individuals, and milk with a reduced amount of lactose also exists. It is extracted from sweet or sour whey. The name comes from ' (gen. '), the Latin word for milk, plus the \\"-ose\\" ending used to name sugars. It has a formula of CHO and the hydrate formula CHO·HO, making it an isomer of sucrose.\\n\\n- An acetate is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with an alkaline, earthy, or metallic base. \\"Acetate\\" also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula CHO. The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a \\"positive\\" ion (called a cation) are also commonly called \\"acetates\\" (hence, \\"acetate of lead\\", \\"acetate of aluminum\\", etc.). The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CHCO, or CHCOO.\\n\\n- A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.\\n\\n- Carbonate rocks are a class of sedimentary rocks composed primarily of carbonate minerals. The two major types are limestone, which is composed of calcite or aragonite (different crystal forms of CaCO) and dolostone, which is composed of the mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO)).\\n\\n- Colostrum (known colloquially as beestings, bisnings or first milk) is a form of milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals (including humans) in late pregnancy. Most species will generate colostrum just prior to calving. Colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease. In general, protein concentration in colostrum is substantially higher than in milk. Fat concentration is substantially higher in colostrum than in milk in some species, e.g. sheep and horses, but lower in colostrum than in milk in some other species, e.g. camels and humans. In swine, fat concentration of milk at 48 to 72 hours after parturition may be higher than in colostrum or in late-lactation milk. Fat concentration in bovine colostrum is extremely variable.\\n\\n- Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- Emmentaler or Emmental is a yellow, medium-hard Swiss cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, Canton Bern. It has a savoury, but mild taste. While the denomination \\"Emmentaler Switzerland\\" is protected, \\"Emmentaler\\" alone is not; similar cheeses of other origins, especially from France and Bavaria and even Finland, are widely available and sold by that name. Emmentaler dates to the time of ancient history.\\n\\n- Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\n\\n- Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.\\n\\n- Jarlsberg is a mild cow's-milk cheese with large regular holes, that originates from Jarlsberg, Norway. Although it originated in Norway, it is also produced in Ohio and Ireland under licenses from Norwegian dairy producers.\\n\\n- Maasdam cheese is a Swiss-style Dutch cheese. Made from cow's milk, it is aged for at least 4 weeks. It ripens faster than other Dutch cheeses. Maasdam has internal holes from the ripening process, and a smooth, yellow rind. Sometimes, it is waxed like Gouda. The cheese was created to compete with the popular Swiss Emmental by being less expensive and quicker to produce. In the process of making a cheese with the same general components as Swiss cheeses, the Dutch ended up with a cheese that is nutty and sweet, but softer than Emmental due to a higher moisture content.\\n\\n- Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.\\n\\n- Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.\\n\\n- A double bond in chemistry is a chemical bond between two chemical elements involving four bonding electrons instead of the usual two. The most common double bond, that is between two carbon atoms, can be found in alkenes. Many types of double bonds exist between two different elements. For example, in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. Other common double bonds are found in azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N) and sulfoxides (S=O). In skeletal formula the double bond is drawn as two parallel lines (=) between the two connected atoms; typographically, the equals sign is used for this. Double bonds were first introduced in chemical notation by prominent Russian chemist Alexander Butlerov.\\n\\n- Ancient history is the aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with Sumerian Cuneiform script, the oldest discovered form of coherent writing from the protoliterate period around the 30th century BC.\\n\\n\\n\\n'propionibacterium freudenreichii' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'taxon rank'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- class\\n - form\\n - group\\n - kingdom\\n - section\\n - species\\n - variety","target":"species","rationale":"'propionibacterium freudenreichii' is related to 'species', which has the relation of 'taxon rank'.\\nThe correct answer is species."},{"source":"An Afghan Hound get all its hair from\\n\\nPick the right answer from the list:\\n- its parents\\n- the water\\n- the sun\\n- its siblings","target":"its parents","rationale":"Genetic traits are inherited from parents and can be passed down to offspring. \\nAfghan Hounds are a specific breed of dog, which means that they have been selectively bred for certain physical characteristics such as their long hair.

POST : At the end of January I went to interview for being the karaoke host on weekends at a bar that was not yet opened. \\n\\nWhen I meet the contact, he seems professional. They have another business and he says he has been an entrepreneur for years. I find out he’s only 18, so my expectations for their hiring process are lowered a bit because it seemed like he didn’t have much experience in it.  \\n\\nI told him of my experience. I asked what they were looking to pay, and he said they hadn’t thought about it yet and what I would ask for (red flag). I asked for a reasonable price which he approved. We talked, he showed me around and told me about their plan and their expectations of me. They’re expecting to open up latest by the end of February. \\n\\nThe interview goes very well, we get along. I sing for him (he wants the host to get the karaoke going at the start of the night). He tells me I have the job and we shake on it. He says he’ll send me an email immediately with more information. Great! I am aware that there’s no contract signed or anything other than word of mouth, so I’m not relying on this or ending my work search.\\n\\nTwo weeks go by and no email. I call, he says basically sorry I’m on vacation, I’ll email you within a few days. Another week goes by. I text him, no answer. Another week and I call again, no answer. At this point I’m very annoyed at his lack of professionalism. Also choosing to refuse getting the hint. \\n\\nAt this point, I get a full time job that will start in the end of March. I could have still made a couple hundred euros working the weekends at the karaoke place until then. I’m mostly just pissed that he is literally ghosting me. Kind of acceptable in dating, but not so in business. \\n\\nAt this point I don’t even want the job anymore nor to work with him but I decide to make it my mission that I will not let him get away with his rude and unprofessional behavior. I have called him once a day for the past 4 days and he has yet to pick up the phone. I sent him a professional text message saying I have tried getting in contact, have yet to hear updates and would like to talk as he had told me that the job was mine. He’s seen the message but has not responded. \\n\\nI understand that this guy, a kid, might be scared or not know how to tell someone it’s not gonna work out. Maybe they didn’t finish the renovations, maybe a friend volunteered to do it, there’s a lot of reasons why they wouldn’t hire me. Frankly, I don’t want the job and I know 100000% that I can’t change this kid’s behavior and that I should let it go and not ruin my reputation over this. \\n\\nI am thinking of calling him from another number, like a friend’s phone or something.

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\\n\\n- Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a Gram - positive , non-motile bacterium that plays an important role in the creation of Emmental cheese , and to some extent , Jarlsberg cheese , Leerdammer and Maasdam cheese . Its concentration in Swiss - type cheeses is higher than in any other cheese . Propionibacteria are commonly found in milk and dairy products , though they have also been extracted from soil . P. freudenreichii has a circular chromosome about 2.5 Mb long . When Emmental cheese is being produced , P. freudenreichii ferments lactate to form acetate , propionate , and carbon dioxide ( 3 C3H6O3  2 C2H5CO2 + C2H3O2 + CO2 ) . The products of this fermentation contribute to the nutty and sweet flavors of the cheese , and the carbon dioxide byproduct is responsible for forming the holes , or \`\` eyes '' in the cheese . Cheesemakers control the size of the holes by changing the acidity , temperature , and curing time of the mixture . An estimated one billion living cells of P. freudenreichii are present in one gram of Emmental . In contrast to most lactic acid bacteria , this bacterium mainly breaks down lipids , forming free fatty acids . Recent research has focused on possible benefits incurred from consuming P. freudenreichii , which are thought to cleanse the gastrointestinal tract . P. freudenreichii has also been suggested to possibly lower the incidence of colon cancer . This mutualistic relationship is unusual in propionibacteria , which are largely commensal . The performance and growth of P. freudenreichii is highly dependent on the presence of Lactobacillus helveticus , which provides essential amino acids . The degradation of L. helvecticus releases a variety of amino acids and peptides . While P. freudenreichii has been found to grow even in the absence of L. helvecticus , some strains of the bacteria were observed lysing in the absence of glutamine , lysine , or tyrosine . The autolysis of P. freudenreichii has been suggested to contribute further to the flavor of the Emmental cheese .

It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.\\n\\n- Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth. This naturally occurring chemical compound is made up of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, in ice caps and glaciers and also in seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas.\\n\\n- Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.\\n\\n- In chemistry, a carbonate is a salt of carbonic acid (HCO), characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion, . The name may also mean an ester of carbonic acid, an organic compound containing the carbonate group C(=O)(O).\\n\\n- Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.\\n\\n- In chemistry, esters are chemical compounds derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an Oalkyl (alkoxy) group. Usually, esters are derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Glycerides, which are fatty acid esters of glycerol, are important esters in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids, and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in essential oils and pheromones. Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules. Nitrate esters, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties, while polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties.\\n\\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- Lactose is a disaccharide sugar composed of galactose and glucose that is found in milk. Lactose makes up around 28% of milk (by weight), although the amount varies among species and individuals, and milk with a reduced amount of lactose also exists. It is extracted from sweet or sour whey. The name comes from ' (gen. '), the Latin word for milk, plus the \\"-ose\\" ending used to name sugars. It has a formula of CHO and the hydrate formula CHO·HO, making it an isomer of sucrose.\\n\\n- An acetate is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with an alkaline, earthy, or metallic base. \\"Acetate\\" also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula CHO. The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a \\"positive\\" ion (called a cation) are also commonly called \\"acetates\\" (hence, \\"acetate of lead\\", \\"acetate of aluminum\\", etc.). The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CHCO, or CHCOO.\\n\\n- A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.\\n\\n- Carbonate rocks are a class of sedimentary rocks composed primarily of carbonate minerals. The two major types are limestone, which is composed of calcite or aragonite (different crystal forms of CaCO) and dolostone, which is composed of the mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO)).\\n\\n- Colostrum (known colloquially as beestings, bisnings or first milk) is a form of milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals (including humans) in late pregnancy. Most species will generate colostrum just prior to calving. Colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease. In general, protein concentration in colostrum is substantially higher than in milk. Fat concentration is substantially higher in colostrum than in milk in some species, e.g. sheep and horses, but lower in colostrum than in milk in some other species, e.g. camels and humans. In swine, fat concentration of milk at 48 to 72 hours after parturition may be higher than in colostrum or in late-lactation milk. Fat concentration in bovine colostrum is extremely variable.\\n\\n- Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- Emmentaler or Emmental is a yellow, medium-hard Swiss cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, Canton Bern. It has a savoury, but mild taste. While the denomination \\"Emmentaler Switzerland\\" is protected, \\"Emmentaler\\" alone is not; similar cheeses of other origins, especially from France and Bavaria and even Finland, are widely available and sold by that name. Emmentaler dates to the time of ancient history.\\n\\n- Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\n\\n- Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.\\n\\n- Jarlsberg is a mild cow's-milk cheese with large regular holes, that originates from Jarlsberg, Norway. Although it originated in Norway, it is also produced in Ohio and Ireland under licenses from Norwegian dairy producers.\\n\\n- Maasdam cheese is a Swiss-style Dutch cheese. Made from cow's milk, it is aged for at least 4 weeks. It ripens faster than other Dutch cheeses. Maasdam has internal holes from the ripening process, and a smooth, yellow rind. Sometimes, it is waxed like Gouda. The cheese was created to compete with the popular Swiss Emmental by being less expensive and quicker to produce. In the process of making a cheese with the same general components as Swiss cheeses, the Dutch ended up with a cheese that is nutty and sweet, but softer than Emmental due to a higher moisture content.\\n\\n- Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.\\n\\n- Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.\\n\\n- A double bond in chemistry is a chemical bond between two chemical elements involving four bonding electrons instead of the usual two. The most common double bond, that is between two carbon atoms, can be found in alkenes. Many types of double bonds exist between two different elements. For example, in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. Other common double bonds are found in azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N) and sulfoxides (S=O). In skeletal formula the double bond is drawn as two parallel lines (=) between the two connected atoms; typographically, the equals sign is used for this. Double bonds were first introduced in chemical notation by prominent Russian chemist Alexander Butlerov.\\n\\n- Ancient history is the aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with Sumerian Cuneiform script, the oldest discovered form of coherent writing from the protoliterate period around the 30th century BC.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'taxon rank' with 'species'.","target":"propionibacterium freudenreichii","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"propionibacterium freudenreichii\\"."},{"source":"SourceMedia is a mid-sized diversified business-to-business digital media company owned by Observer Capital, which acquired the company from Investcorp in August 2014.

Bonham was esteemed for his speed, power, fast bass-drumming, distinctive sound, and \\"feel\\" for the groove. He is considered by some publications to be one of the greatest drummers in rock.\\n\\n- The gittern was a relatively small gut strung round-backed instrument that first appears in literature and pictorial representation during the 13th century in Western Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Italy, France, England). It is usually depicted played with a quill plectrum, as we can see clearly beginning in manuscript illuminations from the thirteenth century. \\nIt was also called the guitarra in Spain, guiterne or guiterre in France, the chitarra in Italy and quintern in Germany. A popular instrument with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs, the gittern is considered ancestral to the modern guitar; possibly other instruments like the mandore and gallichon.\\n\\n- In Through the Out Door is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, and their final album of entirely new material. It was recorded over a three-week period in November and December 1978 at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and released by Swan Song Records on 15 August 1979. \\"In Through the Out Door\\" was the band's eighth and final studio release to reach the top of the charts in America, and was the last released by the band before the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980.\\n\\n- ABBA (stylised ) are a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest, and are the most successful group to ever take part in the competition.\\n\\n- Swan Song Records was a record label launched by the English rock band Led Zeppelin on 10 May 1974. It was overseen by Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant and was a vehicle for the band to promote its own products as well as sign artists who found it difficult to win contracts with other major labels. The decision to launch the label came after Led Zeppelin's five-year contract with Atlantic Records expired at the end of 1973, although Atlantic ultimately distributed the label's product.\\n\\n- Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music.\\n\\n- The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.\\n\\n- British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"\\n\\n- \`\` Carouselambra '' is the fifth track on Led Zeppelin 's 1979 album In Through the Out Door . The name Carouselambra is a reference to the first section of the song sounding similar to carousel music . It is the second - longest song the band recorded in the studio ( after \`\` In My Time of Dying '' ) , clocking in at more than 10 minutes in length . It 's also a very unusual song for the band , as Jimmy Page 's guitar work is pushed almost to the background , while John Paul Jones dominates with heavy use of synthesizers .\\n\\n- Polar Studios was a recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden, which operated from 1978 through 2004. The studio was formed by ABBA musicians Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson and the band's manager Stig Anderson, owner of the Polar Music recording label.\\n\\n- A carousel (American English: from French \\"carrousel\\" and Italian \\"carosello\\"), roundabout (British English), or merry-go-round, is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The \\"seats\\" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music. This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper. Other popular names are jumper, horseabout and flying horses.\\n\\n- An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.\\n\\n- The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.\\n\\n- Robert Anthony Plant, (born 20 August 1948) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band Led Zeppelin. A powerful and wide vocal range (particularly evident in his high-pitched vocals) has given him a successful solo career spanning over 30 years. Plant is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll; he has influenced fellow rock singers such as Freddie Mercury, Axl Rose and Chris Cornell. In 2006, Heavy Metal magazine \\"Hit Parader\\" named Plant the \\"Greatest Metal Vocalist of All Time\\". In 2009, Plant was voted \\"the greatest voice in rock\\" in a poll conducted by \\"Planet Rock\\". In 2008, \\"Rolling Stone\\" editors ranked him number 15 on their list of the 100 best singers of all time. In 2011, \\"Rolling Stone\\" readers ranked Plant the greatest of all lead singers.\\n\\n- American English (variously abbreviated AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), also called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the \\"de facto\\" language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico. Under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory.\\n\\n- Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.\\n\\n- Circus music (also known as carnival music) is any sort of music that is played to accompany a circus, and also music written that emulates its general style. Popular music would also often get arranged for the circus band, as well as waltzes, foxtrots and other dances.\\n\\n- James Patrick \\"Jimmy\\" Page, (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter, and record producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin.\\n\\n- A Zeppelin was a type of rigid airship named after the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who pioneered rigid airship development at the beginning of the 20th century. Zeppelin's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893. They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899. After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word \\"zeppelin\\" came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships. Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG (DELAG), the world's first airline in revenue service. By mid-1914, DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights. During World War I the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts, killing over 500 people in bombing raids in Britain.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'carouselambra' has the relation 'record label' with?","target":"swan song records","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"swan song records\\"."},{"source":"Sentence: To separate butter into cubes, you can\\n\\nChoice 1: Place on a cutting board and use a skewer\\n\\nChoice 2: Place on a cutting board and use a knife\\n\\nWhat is the index of the correct choice for ending for the sentence?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"2","rationale":"The action of separating butter into cubes would require the use of a knife to cut through it, as opposed to using a skewer which will not be able to achieve this.

Previously, we have shown that lentiviral vectors delivering the suicide gene HSV-Tk to experimental brain tumors promote a highly significant treatment effect and thus are promising vectors for clinical translation.', 'In the present study, we tested lentiviral vectors delivering the suicide gene HSV-Tk.007, a highly active mutant of HSV-Tk, to rat brains as a preclinical toxicity study. We injected 10(6) vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped functional lentiviral particles harboring the suicide gene HSV-Tk.007 into the brain of healthy, immunocompetent rats. During prodrug treatment with ganciclovir (GCV), we measured weight and assessed the behavior of the rats in an open field test. After 14\\\\u2009days of GCV treatment, we analyzed HSV-Tk.007 expression in different brain cell populations, as well as inflammatory responses and apoptosis.', 'During prodrug treatment with GCV, behavior experiments did not reveal differences between the treated rats and the control groups.

During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However, she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time, though this time he is carrying a full-length, life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square, as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro, he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square, then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next, Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying. These bizarre coincidences begin to terrify Lisa, and the stranger acts as though she is his long-lost lover. Frantic, Lisa pushes him away and the man falls down a flight of stone steps, apparently dead. Lisa...","target":"Nothing. She was naked.","rationale":"Here is the rationale:\\nNothing.

For example, they typically reach their adult height by about age 15. In addition, girls generally do not grow as fast as boys do during the growth spurt, even at their peak rate of growth.

The family returned to Australia in 1892 when Stan was four years old and settled in Perth, Western Australia. Cross was a gifted student who attended Perth High School on a scholarship. The University of Adelaide offered him a scholarship but Cross turned it down due to his father's ill-health. He left school at sixteen and joined the State Government Railways Department as a clerical cadet. He studied art for a number of years during the evenings at Perth Technical School. In 1912 at the age of twenty four,he resigned from his job and with the financial assistance of his brother he travelled to London to study at Saint Martin's School of Art, during this time some of his cartoons were accepted by Punch. Before sailing for England he exhibited his paintings and pen-and-ink works twice in Perth, the first with the West Australian Society of Arts at their 1913 Annual Exhibition, and the second in March 1914, with another Perth artist, Michael McKinlay. On returning to Perth he contributed freelance drawings to the Western Mail and The Sunday Times, and whilst working as a railways draftsman in 1918, he was offered a job by Ernie Brewer of Smith's Weekly at £5 a week.

He was victorious at least once at the City Dionysia , first probably in the mid- 440s ( IG II2 2325 . 56 ; the fourth entry after Teleclides and three poets whose names have been lost , and just before Hermippus ) , and twice at the Lenaia , first probably in the mid- to late 430s ( IG II2 2325 . 122 ; just after Cratinus and just before Hermippus ) . He was especially famous for his inventive imagination , and the elegance and purity of his diction are attested by the epithet  ( most Attic ) applied to him by Athenaeus and the sophist Phrynichus . He was the inventor of a new meter , called after him , the Pherecratean , which frequently occurs in the choruses of Greek tragedies and in Horace . According to an anonymous essay on tragedy , Pherecrates wrote 18 plays , suggesting that one or more of the 19 surviving titles must be eliminated somehow ( i.e. by assigning the play to another author who wrote a comedy by the same name , and assuming an ancient scholarly error , or by identifying e.g. The Human Heracles and The Fake Heracles as a single play with multiple titles ) .\\n\\n- Aristophanes (or  ; c. 446  c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it.\\n\\n- Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes  whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis.\\n\\n- A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.\\n\\n- In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries.\\n\\n- Hermippus (fl. 5th century BC) was the one-eyed Athenian writer of the Old Comedy who flourished during the Peloponnesian War. \\nLife.\\nHe was the son of Lysis, and the brother of the comic poet Myrtilus. He was younger than Telecleides and older than Eupolis and Aristophanes. According to the Suda, he wrote forty plays, and his chief actor was Simeron, according to the scholiast of Aristophanes. The titles and fragments of nine of his plays are preserved. He was a bitter opponent of Pericles, whom he accused (probably in the \\"Moirai\\") of being a bully and a coward, and of carousing with his boon companions while the Lacedaemonians were invading Attica. He also accused Aspasia of impiety and offences against morality, and her acquittal was only secured by the tears of Pericles (Plutarch, \\"Pericles\\", 32). In the \\"Female Bread-Sellers\\", he attacked the demagogue Hyperbolus. The \\"Mat-Carriers\\" contains many parodies of Homer.\\n\\n- Lysistrata (or ; Attic Greek: , \\"Army Disbander\\") is a comedy by Aristophanes. Originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BC, it is a comic account of one woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peacea strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career. It was produced in the same year as the \\"Thesmophoriazusae\\", another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition.\\n\\n- The Clouds (\\"Nephelai\\") is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes. A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens, it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423BC and was not as well-received as the author had hoped, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year. It was revised between 420 and 417BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form.\\n\\n- Ancient Greek comedy was one of the final three principal dramatic forms in the theatre of classical Greece (the others being tragedy and the satyr play). Athenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods: Old Comedy, Middle Comedy, and New Comedy. Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, while Middle Comedy is largely lost, i.e. preserved only in relatively short fragments by authors such as Athenaeus of Naucratis. New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of Menander. \\n\\n\\n\\n'pherecrates' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'country of citizenship'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- athens\\n - attica\\n - classical athens\\n - greece\\n - writer","target":"classical athens","rationale":"The Pherecrates entity is under the Wirter category and he was a Greek poet of Athenian Old Comedy, who lived in classical Athens.\\nSo \\"classical athens\\" is related to 'pherecrates' through the relation of 'country of citizenship'."},{"source":"In this task, you are given two strings A, B.

In the 1930s the LPO had flourished, but since Beecham's departure in 1940, it had struggled to survive. Boult was well known to the orchestra, having been among the musicians who came to its aid in 1940. He took over as chief conductor of the LPO in June 1950, immediately after leaving the BBC, and threw himself into the task of rebuilding it. In the early years of his conductorship, the finances of the LPO were perilous, and Boult subsidised the orchestra from his own funds for some time. The need to earn money obliged the orchestra to play many more concerts than its rivals. In the 1949–50 season, the LPO gave 248 concerts, compared with 55 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra, and 32 apiece by the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic orchestras.\\nAlthough he had worked extensively in the studio for the BBC, Boult had, up to this point, recorded only a part of his large repertoire for the gramophone.  With the LPO he began a series of commercial recordings that continued at a varying rate for the rest of his working life. Their first recordings together were Elgar's Falstaff, Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen with the mezzo Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven's First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by the reviewers. Of the Elgar, The Gramophone wrote, \\"I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult's] performance. ... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably\\". In The Manchester Guardian, Neville Cardus wrote, \\"Nobody is better able than Sir Adrian Boult to expound the subtly mingled contents of this master work.\\"In January 1951 Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Kennedy as \\"gruelling\\", with 12 concerts on 12 successive days.

After admitting that the only thing he was scared of was spiders, Tremaine recruited Steve-O for MTV's television series Jackass, which became an instant hit. MTV has subsequently released five movies based on the series: Jackass: The Movie (2002), Jackass Number Two (2006), direct-home release Jackass 2.5 (2007), Jackass 3D (2010), and Jackass 3.5. The installments Jackass: The Movie, Jackass Number Two, Jackass 3D, and Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa all became box office hits.  In 2001, he released Don't Try This at Home on DVD, which contained material MTV censored. It went on to sell 140,000 copies. He toured promoting the DVD doing stunts, which was filmed and released as Don't Try This at Home Volume 2: The Tour.  On July 31, 2002, Steve-O was arrested on obscenity and assault charges for stapling his scrotum to his leg, and for being a principal to a second-degree battery, during a performance at a nightclub in Houma, Louisiana on July 11, 2002. After several delays, in March 2003 Steve-O made a deal with Louisiana prosecutors placing him on supervised probation for one year, requiring him to make a charitable donation of $5,000 to a shelter for battered women and children and forbidding him from ever performing in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana again.  In 2003, Steve-O toured Europe with Bam Margera, a friend and co-star of Jackass. On May 22, 2003, Steve-O was arrested and jailed while in Sweden due to footage of himself swallowing a condom containing cannabis to get it past authorities while flying on a plane. He then regurgitated it live on stage, which he showed in his DVD Steve-O: Out on Bail (aka Don't Try This at Home - The Steve-O Video Vol. 3: Out on Bail) (2003). Steve-O reached a deal with the Swedish prosecutors and was released on May 27, 2003 after paying a 45,000 kronor (about 6,700 USD) fine. As part of the plea bargain Steve-O admitted to possessing one ecstasy tablet and five grams of marijuana, although he claimed he had no knowledge of where the ecstasy came from. The Swedish arrest was included in the third installment of the DVD series titled Steve-O: Out on Bail. Two months later on July 19, 2003, Steve-O was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct for urinating on potato chips in public during a Lollapalooza tour concert in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania.

It is centered just south of the Martian equator at and covers 2600 km at its widest extent. The area reveals \\"chaos terrain\\", outflow channels, and alluvial plains that are indicative of massive flooding. Wind erosion patterns are also in evidence. A region within the terra shows some of the highest valley network densities on the planet. Ares Vallis is another notable feature, where the flood and flow patterns are in evidence; it was the landing site of \\"Mars 6\\" and NASA's \\"Mars Pathfinder\\". It is also one of several proposed landing sites for the Mars 2020 Rover.\\n\\n- A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\".\\n\\n- The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.\\nAbout three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.\\n\\n- A rift valley is a linear-shaped lowland between several highlands or mountain ranges created by the action of a geologic rift or fault. A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary, a crustal extension, a spreading apart of the surface, which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion. When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart, a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks, forming a graben. The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new. That feature is the beginning of the rift valley, but as the process continues, the valley widens, until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area. One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift. On Earth, rifts can occur at all elevations, from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust. They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys, which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically.\\n\\n- Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.\\n\\n- An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.\\n\\n- Xanthe Terra is a large area on Mars, centered just north of the Martian equator. Its coordinates are and it covers 2465 km at its broadest extent. Its name means \\"golden-yellow land.\\" It is in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle, and the Oxia Palus quadrangle.\\nImages from Mars Express, Mars Global Surveyor, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed ancient river valleys and deltas. The deltas show many thin layers just as deltas on Earth. Scientists speculate that features in Xanthe Terra show evidence of precipitation on early Mars.\\n\\n- Iani Chaos is a region of chaos terrain at the south end of the outflow channel Ares Vallis, of the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle (MC-19) region of the planet Mars, centered at approximately ~342°E, 2°S. This is the source region of Ares Vallis. The chaotic terrain is widely believed to have formed via the removal of subsurface water or ice, resulting in flooding at the surface, and the formation of Ares Vallis. Within Iani Chaos, deposited stratigraphically above the chaotic terrain, are smooth, low-slope, intermediate-to-light-toned deposits that are rich in a hydrated mineral that is most likely gypsum as well as hematite.\\n\\n- Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.\\n\\n- Mars Pathfinder (MESUR Pathfinder) is an American robotic spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars in 1997. It consisted of a lander, renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station, and a lightweight (10.6 kg/23 lb) wheeled robotic Mars rover named \\"Sojourner\\", which became the first rover to operate outside \\nthe Earth-Moon system.\\n\\n- The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. \\n\\n- An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.\\n\\n- Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide typically containing traces of iron, titanium, vanadium and chromium. It is a rock-forming mineral. It is a naturally transparent material, but can have different colors when impurities are present. Transparent specimens are used as gems, called \\"ruby\\" if red and \\"padparadscha\\" if pink-orange. All other colors are called \\"sapphire\\", e.g., \\"green sapphire\\" for a green specimen.\\n\\n- Valles Marineris (Latin for \\"Mariner Valleys\\", named after the \\"Mariner 9\\" Mars orbiter of 197172 which discovered it) is a system of canyons that runs along the Martian surface east of the Tharsis region. At more than long, wide and up to deep, Valles Marineris is one of the largest canyons of the Solar System, surpassed in length only by the rift valleys of Earth.\\n\\n- Ares Vallis is an outflow channel on Mars, named after the Greek name for Mars: Ares, the god of war; it appears to have been carved by fluids, perhaps water. The valley 'flows' northwest out of the hilly Margaritifer Terra, where the Iani Chaos depression long and wide) is connected to the beginning of Ares Vallis by a wide transition zone centered on 342.5° East (17.5 West) and 3° North. It then continues through the ancient Xanthe Terra highlands, and ends in a delta-like region of Chryse Planitia. Ares Vallis was the landing site of NASA's \\"Mars Pathfinder\\" spacecraft, which studied a region of the valley near the border with Chryse in 1997.\\n\\n- Meteor Crater is a meteorite impact crater approximately east of Flagstaff and west of Winslow in the northern Arizona desert of the United States. Because the United States Board on Geographic Names commonly recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office, the feature acquired the name of \\"Meteor Crater\\" from the nearby post office named Meteor. The site was formerly known as the Canyon Diablo Crater and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite. Scientists refer to the crater as Barringer Crater in honor of Daniel Barringer, who was first to suggest that it was produced by meteorite impact. The crater is privately owned by the Barringer family through their Barringer Crater Company, which proclaims it to be the \\"best preserved meteorite crater on Earth\\".\\n\\n- Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.\\n\\n- Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (FeO), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above .\\n\\n- Aram Chaos , centered at 2.6 ° N , 21.5 ° W , comprises a heavily eroded impact crater on the planet Mars . It lies at the eastern end of the large canyon Valles Marineris and close to Ares Vallis . Various geological processes have reduced it to a circular area of chaotic terrain . Aram Chaos takes its name from Aram , one of the classical albedo features observed by Giovanni Schiaparelli , who named it after the Biblical land of Aram . Spectroscopic observation from orbit indicates the presence of the mineral hematite , likely a signature of a once aqueous environment . Aram Chaos measures about 280 kilometers ( 170 mi ) across , and lies in a region called Margaritifer Terra , where many water - carved channels show that floods poured out of the highlands onto the northern lowlands ages ago . The Thermal Emission Imaging System ( THEMIS ) on the orbiter Mars Odyssey found gray crystalline hematite on the floor of Aram . CRISM , the spectroscope on the MRO , found hyrdrated sulfates , jarosite , and hematite . Hematite is an iron - oxide mineral that can precipitate when ground water circulates through iron - rich rocks , whether at normal temperatures or in hot springs . The floor of Aram contains huge blocks of collapsed , or chaotic , terrain that formed when water or ice was catastrophically removed . Elsewhere on Mars , the release of groundwater produced massive floods that eroded the large channels seen in Ares Vallis and similar outflow valleys . In Aram Chaos , however , the released water stayed mostly within the crater 's ramparts , eroding only a small , shallow outlet channel in the eastern wall . Several minerals including hematite sulfate minerals , and water - altered silicates in Aram suggests that a lake probably once existed within the crater .

Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker.

In small populations, demographic stochasticity will decrease the population growth rate, causing an effect similar to the Allee effect, which will increase the risk of population extinction. Whether or not demographic stochasticity can be considered a part of Allee effect is somewhat contentious however. The most current definition of Allee effect considers the correlation between population density and mean individual fitness. Therefore, random variation resulting from birth and death events would not be considered part of Allee effect as the increased risk of extinction is not a consequence of the changing fates of individuals within the population.Meanwhile, when demographic stochasticity results in fluctuations of sex ratios, it arguably reduces the mean individual fitness as population declines. For example, a fluctuation in small population that causes a scarcity in one sex would in turn limit the access of mates for the opposite sex, decreasing the fitness of the individuals within the population. This type of Allee effect will likely be more prevalent in monogamous species than polygynous species.\\n\\nand the situation: Two small cities of identical population are both having elections this year.

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia.

Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke.  On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear.  Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.","target":"Palazzo Pitti","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes on moving into the palace.

He retained the original pathways, but added a canal and fountain to the garden's center. The south garden was divided into four equally sized lawns, with hillocks in their center topped with a large vase crafted by Antonio Isopi.

He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below .\\n\\nGreg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model.

If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a 2-point conversion. The other team then scrimmages the ball at the same 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score.

Richard tricks Liu into believing he is simply providing reconnaissance of a meet involving Mr. Big. The plans are changed when Mr. Big is introduced to two prostitutes, one being Jessica Kamen (Bridget Fonda), an American woman, who takes him to his room to service him. While Liu and the rest were watching through the surveillance camera, Mr. Big kicks everyone out except for the two prostitutes. While a prostitute is on top of Mr. Big, she attempts to murder him. Witnessing the events from a surveillance room, Liu rushes to stop the prostitutes.

However, patients still have to pay a substantial proportion of their annual income for treatment of this disease. This study describes the economic burden on patients with tuberculosis; identifies related factors by comparing two areas with different management models; and provides policy recommendation for tuberculosis control reform in China. There are three tuberculosis management models in China: the tuberculosis dispensary model, specialist model and integrated model. We selected Zhangjiagang (ZJG) and Taixing (TX) as the study sites, which correspond to areas implementing the integrated model and dispensary model, respectively. Patients diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis since January 2010 were recruited as study subjects. A total of 590 patients (316 patients from ZJG and 274 patients from TX) were interviewed with a response rate of 81%. The economic burden attributed to tuberculosis, including direct costs and indirect costs, was estimated and compared between the two study sites. The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to compare the cost differences between the two groups. Potential factors related to the total outof-pocket costs were analyzed based on a step-by-step multivariate linear regression model after the logarithmic transformation of the costs. The average (median, interquartile range) total cost was 18793.33 (9965, 3200-24400) CNY for patients in ZJG, which was significantly higher than for patients in TX (mean: 6598.33, median: 2263, interquartile range: 983-6688) (Z = 10.42, P < 0.001).

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

But in this age of high-tech home equipment, the simple joy of jumping rope has been forgotten.

First, most people consider jumping rope to be an excellent form of cardiovascular   exercise, but they also believe that it is simply too difficult.

These cells cause relaxation of arterial segments with intact endothelium through release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor.', 'Healthy subjects were given either no drug, verapamil or aspirin for > or = 5 days before their platelets were obtained. The effects of platelets obtained from subjects before and after treatment with aspirin or verapamil on the tone of rat aortic rings were determined.', 'As expected, control platelets (before verapamil or aspirin treatment) induced concentration-dependent relaxation of rat aortic rings with intact endothelium and a concentration-dependent contraction of de-endothelialized rings.

We propose a new interpretation for depth and inter-layer connectivity where a hierarchy of independencies in the input distribution is encoded in the network structure. This results in structures allowing neurons to connect to neurons in any deeper layer skipping intermediate layers. Moreover, neurons in deeper layers encode low-order (small condition sets) independencies and have a wide scope of the input, whereas neurons in the first layers encode higher-order (larger condition sets) independencies and have a narrower scope. Thus, the depth of the network is automatically determined---equal to the maximal order of independence in the input distribution, which is the recursion-depth of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm constructs two main graphical models: 1) a generative latent graph (a deep belief network) learned from data and 2) a deep discriminative graph constructed from the generative latent graph. We prove that conditional dependencies between the nodes in the learned generative latent graph are preserved in the class-conditional discriminative graph. Finally, a deep neural network structure is constructed based on the discriminative graph. We demonstrate on image classification benchmarks that the algorithm replaces the deepest layers (convolutional and dense layers) of common convolutional networks, achieving high classification accuracy, while constructing significantly smaller structures. The proposed structure learning algorithm requires a small computational cost and runs efficiently on a standard desktop CPU.","target":"A principled approach for structure learning of deep neural networks with a new interpretation for depth and inter-layer connectivity.","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nA principled approach for structure learning of deep neural networks with a new interpretation for depth and inter-layer connectivity."},{"source":"Given a goal and 2 solutions, choose the most appropriate solution.\\nGoal: where do I find the Vega start\\n- Solution 1: To find the star Vega in the constellation Lyra, look directly overhead.

We’re both on our last year of college and we’ve been together for 4 years, we were even about to get married but called it off for now because of money/college issues. Her college is out of the city she normally lives in (which is where I live as well) so it takes me 5 hours to get to her and 5 hours to get back each time I want to see her and unless it’s the midterm/finals week I usually go to her place every weekend to stay for the weekend and return home. This semester of college, my schedule is a bit fucked up so my school starta at 8 in the morning on my mondays and ends at 7 in the afternoon at my fridays. This makes it so that I can only go to her on saturdays and return 1 day later on sundays. Which means I spend around 10 hours on the road in 48 hours to be with her for 24 hours every weekend. I’m telling you this because these numbers are important.\\n\\nI never whine about this or resent her for this since she did the same things for me on our first year but we decided that it’s better for me to go to her being because of me being male and all.\\n\\nAnyways back to the situation. This week our female cat got in hear for the first time, she lives with my gf as she was a present from me for her. Anyways she’s in heat but also it turns out her fur is somehow full of lice as well even though she never leaves the house and we had her get a lice bath (or whatever it’s called) from our veterenarian. I tell my gf to go back to them and get our cat shaved there and etc.\\n\\nShe gets the lice situation done with no problems on last saturday. But since Bubbles (our cat) is in heat she tells me that the cat is screaming and meowing like a maniac and she couldn’t sleep the whole night. Cue the same thing happening on sunday as well. So it’s monday now and she was able to sleep like a total of 8-9 hours when Bubbles was asleep as well.\\n\\nNow to the problem:\\n\\nI told her that I can come over on Monday and stay and look after Bubbles till Wednesday so she can get her sleep and relax a bit she says that it’s not necessary and she can handle it.  I ask her again to make sure and she says you don’t need to come over again. (Note that she’s not doing this for me to not miss out on my lectures because my lessons and at 12 in the morning on mondays, my tuesdays are empty and my lectures start at 5 in the afternoon on wednesdays so I could go to her and back without missing anything) Ok, so I’ll see her at saturday right? WRONG.\\n\\nToday at 2 PM she messages me asking if I could come over. Now, this is really fucky because I don’t have a car and I use a ferry to go over the sea and then get on a bus to get to her, Next ferry is leaving at 4 PM and it takes me an hour and half (if I’m lucky) to get to the ferry. I have 2 hours to take a shower, get ready to go to her, pack some clothes and make it to the ferry which is impossible. Next ferry is at 7 PM so I can make it to that one but what’s the point then? I get on that ferry and I’ll be at her place at 10 in the evening. I’ll need to be back before 5 PM tomorrow so I’ll be going over there to be there and look after Bubbles for 11 hours.\\n\\nI ask her why didn’t she tell me to come over when I asked her and she says that she thought she could handle it and couldn’t and says that she thought I could just come over to her and drop by (the fuck?). I’m getting pissed now but not saying anything about it I ask her why she doesn’t ask some of her female besties (that she always goes on and on about) to come over and look after Bubbles while she sleeps. Them coming from 10 mins away to help her out when she needs makes more sense than a guy coming over from 5 hours away right? NOPE!\\n\\nShe laughs at my ‘stupid’ suggestion saying ‘why should they do that?’.

But we occasionally encounter a strong acid or base, such as stomach acid, which has a strongly acidic pH of 1.7. By definition, strong acids and bases can produce a relatively large amount of H+ or OH−ions and consequently have marked chemical activities. In addition, very small amounts of strong acids and bases can change the pH of a solution very quickly. If 1 mL of stomach acid [approximated as 0.1 M HCl(aq)] were added to the bloodstream and no correcting mechanism were present, the pH of the blood would decrease from about 7.4 to about 4.7—a pH that is not conducive to continued living. Fortunately, the body has a mechanism for minimizing such dramatic pH changes. The mechanism involves a buffer, a solution that resists dramatic changes in pH. Buffers do so by being composed of certain pairs of solutes: either a weak acid plus a salt derived from that weak acid or a weak base plus a salt of that weak base. For example, a buffer can be composed of dissolved HC2H3O2 (a weak acid) and NaC2H3O2 (the salt derived from that weak acid). Another example of a buffer is a solution containing NH3 (a weak base) and NH4Cl (a salt derived from that weak base). Let us use an HC2H3O2/NaC2H3O2 buffer to demonstrate how buffers work. If a strong base—a source of OH−(aq) ions—is added to the buffer solution, those OH− ions will react with the HC2H3O2 in an acid-base reaction:.\\n\\n\\nQ: What is the term for a solution that resists dramatic changes in ph?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- inert\\n\\n- neutral\\n\\n- stable\\n\\n- buffer\\n\\nA:","target":"buffer","rationale":"A buffer is a solution that resists dramatic changes in pH."},{"source":"Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is more topical with respect to continuing the prompt.

Building Y had many seniors over 65 years of age, and building X had individuals under 65 years old.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich building had fewer people that have more time for their hobbies?\\n\\nHint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.","target":"building X","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that building Y had many seniors over 65 years of age, and building X had individuals under 65 years old. Since most people over the age of 65 are retired from work, they have fewer resources to spend on their hobbies as compared to those who work full-time jobs. Therefore, it is likely that there would be more hobbyists in an apartment complex where a majority of the tenants were below the age of 65.\\nSo based on these facts we can conclude that \\"building X\\" has fewer people with time for their hobbies.\\""},{"source":"This schema for the novel \\"Ulysses\\" was produced by its author, James Joyce, in 1921 to help his friend, Stuart Gilbert, understand the fundamental structure of the book.

Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum at the highest levels of competition) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which is an indication of the average height of the jumps. In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine. This is followed by a final routine which is optional. Some competitions restart the score from zero for the finals, other add the final score to the preliminary results.","target":"a final routine","rationale":"The context is about the rules of trampolining in high level competitions.
