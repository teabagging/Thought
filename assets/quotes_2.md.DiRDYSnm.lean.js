By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march.

In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being, and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss.\\n\\n- Breast development, also known as mammogenesis, is a complex biological process in primates that takes place throughout a female's life. It occurs across several phases, including prenatal development, puberty, and pregnancy. At menopause, breast development ceases and the breasts atrophy. Breast development results in prominent and developed structures on the chest known as breasts in primates, which serve as both a sexual characteristic and as mammary glands. The process is mediated by an assortment of hormones (and growth factors), the most important of which include estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and growth hormone.\\n\\n- Growth hormone (GH), also known as somatotropin (or as human growth hormone [hGH or HGH] in its human form), is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. It is thus important in human development. It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to certain kinds of cells. Growth hormone is a 191-amino acid, single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized, stored, and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.\\n\\n- A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.\\n\\n- Estrogen (American English) or oestrogen (British English) is the primary female sex hormone as well as a medication. It is responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. \\"Estrogen\\" may also refer to any substance, natural or synthetic, that mimics the effects of the natural hormone. The estrane steroid estradiol is the most potent and prevalent endogenous estrogen, although several metabolites of estradiol also have estrogenic hormonal activity. Estrogens are used as medications as part of some oral contraceptives, in hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal, hypogonadal, and transgender women, and in the treatment of certain hormone-sensitive cancers like prostate cancer and breast cancer. They are one of three types of sex hormones, the others being androgens/anabolic steroids like testosterone and progestogens like progesterone.\\n\\n- Androgen (from Greek \\"andro\\" meaning male human being), also called androgenic hormone or testoid, is any natural or synthetic compound, usually a steroid hormone, that stimulates or controls the development and maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates by binding to androgen receptors. This includes the activity of the primary male sex organs and development of male secondary sex characteristics. Androgens were first discovered in 1936. Androgens increase in both boys and girls during puberty. Androgens are also the original anabolic steroids and the precursor of all estrogens. The primary and most well-known androgen is testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione are less known generally, but are of equal importance in male development. DHT in the embryo life causes differentiation of penis, scrotum and prostate. Later in life DHT contributes to balding, prostate growth and sebaceous gland activity. Although androgens are described as male sex hormones, both males and females have them to varying degrees, as is also true of estrogens. They are one of three types of sex hormones, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone.\\n\\n- A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.\\n\\n- A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal.\\n\\n- The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of female primates. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development. Males do not develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts because their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing breast tissue. The breasts of females are typically far more prominent than those of males.\\n\\n- Intraductal papillomas of the breast are benign lesions with an incidence of approximately 2 - 3 % in humans . Two types of intraductal papillomas are generally distinguished . The central type develops near the nipple . They are usually solitary and often arise in the period nearing menopause . On the other hand , the peripheral type are often multiple papillomas arising at the peripheral breasts , and are usually found in younger women . The peripheral type are associated with a higher risk of malignancy . They are the most common cause of bloody nipple discharge in women age 20 - 40 and generally do not show up on mammography due to their small size , so the next step in treatment would be a galactogram to guide the subsequent biopsy . The masses are often too small to be palpated or felt . A galactogram is therefore necessary to rule out the lesion . Excision is sometimes performed . Microdochectomy / microdochotomy ( removal of a breast duct ) is the treatment of choice .\\n\\n- The torso or trunk is an anatomical term for the central part of the many animal bodies (including that of the human) from which extend the neck and limbs. The torso includes the thorax and the abdomen.\\n\\n- A lesion is any abnormal damage or change in the tissue of an organism, usually caused by disease or trauma. \\"Lesion\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"laesio\\" meaning \\"injury\\". Lesions may occur in plants as well as animals.\\n\\n- A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).\\n\\n- An infant (from the Latin word \\"infans\\", meaning \\"unable to speak\\" or \\"speechless\\") is the more formal or specialised synonym for \\"baby\\", the very young offspring of a human or other animal. \\n\\n- Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'intraductal papilloma' has the relation 'instance of' with?","target":"disease","rationale":"The answer is disease."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a dialogue from a conversation between an agent and a customer.

More recently a number of different techniques have been applied to examine the temporalespatial information about the airflow patterns and the movement of related, suspended material within this air in a hospital setting. Closer collaboration with engineers has allowed clinical microbiologists, virologists and infection control teams to assess the effectiveness of hospital isolation and ventilation facilities. The characteristics of human respiratory activities have also been investigated using some familiar engineering techniques. Such studies aim to enhance the effectiveness of such preventive measures and have included experiments with humanlike mannequins using various tracer gas/particle techniques, real human volunteers with realtime non-invasive Schlieren imaging, numerical modelling using computational fluid dynamics, and small scale physical analogues with water.

I have suffered from generalized anxiety since the birth of my daughter three years ago, and was very nervous I'd miscarry again.\\n\\nEarlier this week, my period was due. I began lightly bleeding a handful of days prior to it being due, which made me nervous. Early periods + PCOS usually don't mean anything good (in my experience). But I had a feeling I might be pregnant, even though it's insanely early -- I just know my body. I took a handful of pregnancy tests that all came out positive (this was Monday). I called my doctor because I knew I'd been bleeding and was panicked I was having a chemical pregnancy. I felt triggered, scared, stressed, and emotional.\\n\\nI had my hcg levels tested on Monday (again, this would have been the day my period was due - very early on if pregnant). They were low. The nurse who delivered the results said she thought it very well was a chemical pregnancy. Naturally, I was devastated - sure, it's early, but it's still a heartbreak. It took me so long to feel ready again, and my worst fears were happening once more. It's a lot. My husband told his mom what was going on (I really wish he didn't, but I never told him not to and... well, it's too late now). \\n\\nShe had the same \\"oh it's so early, thank god it happened now and not later\\" reaction. I tried to ignore it because that's just who she is, and I was too emotional to give her the reaction and confrontation I wanted to. (Side note: my best friend's dad passed away tragically over the weekend and I've been trying to be a support to her all week, so my emotions are not at all stable).\\n\\nFast forward to yesterday morning, TWO DAYS after finding out I'm likely having a chemical pregnancy again, and she texts me and asks me if she could borrow our old pack 'n play for her husband's grandson (whom she's never met and doesn't give a shit about, but is visiting for the holidays).

Again, on the very next play, Brady was intercepted by Davon House who returned the ball 82 yards to the Patriots 26, however, the Jags were called for pass interference again, moving the ball to the 1-yard line. On the very next play, LeGarrette Blount ran it in for a touchdown and a 30-3 Patriots lead.

Following Jacksonville's touchdown, the Patriots matched with one of their own. Midway through the 7 play, 80-yard drive, a horse-collar tackle at the end of a 17-yard Blount run moved the ball to the Jaguars 15. Two plays later Brady hit rookie receiver Keshawn Martin on a 13-yard touchdown pass, increasing the lead to 37-10.  After forcing the Jaguars into a turnover on downs, the Patriots didn't skip a beat marching 24 yards, needing only 5 plays, with Blount rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter making the score an embarrassing 44-10. Following a Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots took a page from the Jaguars playbook slowly moving 58 yards in 17 plays, taking 9:47 off the clock, scoring on another 1-yard touchdown run by Blount, blowing the lid off with a 51-10 score.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.\\n\\n- The Colorado Avalanche are a professional ice hockey team based in Denver, Colorado.

It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster.

However, the differences in PRP quality among numerous preparation methods remain unclear. Specifically, the benefit of including leukocytes in the PRP product remains controversial, and few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of the interaction between platelets and leukocytes on the growth factor concentrations. The aim of the present study was to compare the biological characteristics of PRPs focusing on the leukocyte concentration and composition.', 'Leucocyte rich (LR)-PRP, leucocyte poor (LP)-PRP, and pure-PRP were prepared from the peripheral blood of 6 healthy male volunteers (mean age: 31.3 years). The concentrations of platelets, leukocytes, erythrocytes, growth factors (transforming growth factor-beta 1: TGF-β1; fibroblast growth factor-basic: FGF-b; platelet-derived growth factor-BB: PDGF-BB; vascular endothelial growth factor: VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) from each of the PRP samples were measured. Considering the interaction between platelets and leukocytes, correlations between platelets/leukocytes and growth factors/MMP-9 were analyzed using partial correlation coefficients.', 'The platelet concentration did not differ among the three PRP preparation methods.

The platelet concentration positively correlated with all growth factors. On the other hand, the leukocyte concentration positively correlated with PDGF-BB and the VEGF concentration, while it negatively correlated with FGF-b.

Jane didn't do anything about it yet, because she has fewer aphids on her farm, but she vows to do so in the near future.\\n\\nWhich farmer had more aphids resistant to pyrethroids?\\n\\nHint: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect.

Rundgren was originally concerned that they had taken \\"the worst sounding studio in the city at that time\\" because it was the only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: \\"The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate.\\" New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of $17,000 (equivalent to $96,000 in 2018). With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, \\"we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn't like these people who conceptualize things. It was just a document of what was going on at the time.\\"In the studio, the New York Dolls dressed in their usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did not approve of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the sessions to \\"get the glitter out of your asses and play\\".

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me!\\nToday I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag.\\nThe first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too.\\nThe mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit.

Some cases of duct occlusion are suitable for reconstructive surgery. The authors describe a reconstructive technique based on full mobilization of a single loop of the epididymal duct as caudally as possible with two-layer side-to-end anastomosis to the vas deferens. To ensure follow-up evaluation of each anastomosis, unilateral anastomosis was done primarily. In a few cases, cross-over anastomosis was necessary. In cases of reoperation, if possible, this was performed on the same side. When the epididymal duct system was found empty, the contralateral epididymis was explored. Patients with postoperative oligozoospermia were offered a supplementary contralateral operation. From 1980 to 1984, 41 patients underwent epididymovasostomy. At follow-up evaluation, 35 (85%) presented sperms in repeated tests. Fifteen of these patients (37%) have fathered children. Patients with postoperative normospermia and no antisperm antibodies had an excellent fertility prognosis. The single-loop dissection technique provides anatomic specificity and a high percentage of patent anastomoses and does not interfere with the possibilities of reoperation. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Microsurgical epididymovasostomy in the treatment of occlusive azoospermia. option2: Long-term evaluation of training residents in clinical teaching skills.","target":"Microsurgical epididymovasostomy in the treatment of occlusive azoospermia","rationale":"The abstract describes a new microsurgical technique that uses full mobilization of a single loop of the epididymal duct to treat cases of occlusive azoospermia.

He was voted the \\"10th Greatest Guitarist\\" by Guitar World magazine, and has sold over 15 million records. A three-time Grammy Award winner and fifteen-time nominee, Vai started his music career in 1978 at the age of 18 as a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, and joined his band from 1980 to 1983. He embarked on a solo career in 1983 and has released eight solo albums to date.\\n\\nIn 1978, Vai sent both a notated transcription of Frank Zappa's \\"The Black Page\\", and a recording of his college band, Morning Thunder, to Zappa. Impressed by this, Zappa responded by putting Vai on salary as a transcriptionist to transcribe his work, which included pieces from the Joe's Garage and Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar albums. After leaving Berklee College of Music and moving to California, Vai auditioned for and became a full-time member of Zappa's band, going on his first tour with Zappa in the fall of 1980. Zappa often referred to Vai as his \\"little Italian virtuoso\\", and Vai is frequently listed in the liner notes of Zappa's albums as having performed \\"stunt\\" or \\"impossible\\" guitar parts.  Vai was a featured artist on the 1993 release Zappa's Universe, and in 2006, Vai appeared as a special guest on Dweezil Zappa's Zappa Plays Zappa tour; both projects won Vai a Grammy Award.  After moving on from Zappa's employ in 1983, Vai bought a house in Sylmar, Los Angeles, where he built his first professional studio. During this period, Vai formed two bands (The Classified and 777) as well as writing and recording a large amount of music that was not originally intended for release. Out of this material, Vai compiled his first studio album Flex-Able. He created his own record label, Akashic Records (later Light Without Heat Records), which he used to take Flex-Able directly to distribution channels. Flex-Able was released in January 1984.  Vai began his rise to public acclaim in 1983 when, shortly before the release of Flex-Able, his composition \\"The Attitude Song\\" was published in Guitar Player magazine. The song centered itself on a main guitar riff in the time signature 7/16, played over a rhythm section centered in 4/4. Each following section of the song showcased a number of specialized techniques (such as two-handed tapping, whammy bar acrobatics, sweep picking, alternate picking, multi-part harmonies, and odd phrasing) used in angular and exaggerated ways that were unique to the song at the time. Interest from the public eye grew more so when Vai's song \\"Blue Powder\\" (a demonstration for the Carvin X100b amplifier) was published in Guitar Player as well, which showed the virtuoso side of Vai's compositional process. Also in 1986, Vai was cast in the blockbuster film Crossroads as the Devil's guitar player \\"Jack Butler\\". In the famous \\"duel scene\\" between Vai and Ralph Macchio's characters, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar, which was performed by Ry Cooder.  In between solo work, Vai replaced Yngwie Malmsteen in June 1984 as the lead guitarist of Alcatrazz, with whom he recorded the album Disturbing the Peace. Vai left shortly after the subsequent tour to join David Lee Roth's band.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

Passage:Much as was the case of the concurrent development of professional gridiron football, the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania metropolitan area was one of the first areas to promote a professional ice hockey team. The Western Pennsylvania Hockey League began hiring professional players in 1902 and acted as a pro–am league. This league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the International Professional Hockey League in 1904, with Houghton, Michigan dentist Jack Gibson its founder. While this league had folded by 1907, it was the start of professional hockey. The United States would continue to see professional hockey with teams from the PCHL, beginning with the Portland Rosebuds, followed by a Seattle-based franchise a year later. When the Boston Bruins joined the NHL in 1924, the United States was finally represented in the league. It would continue to grow in the NHL until a peak in the 2000s (decade), when 24 of the NHL's 30 teams were in the United States (the loss of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg in 2011 reduced this number to 23; it returned to 24 American teams when the Vegas Golden Knights joined in 2017). The NHL will reach a higher peak when the Seattle expansion franchise joins the league in 2021-22 as the 25th American team. There are several other pro leagues in the US as well; as of 2019 these include the AHL, ECHL, SPHL, and FPHL. The AHL and ECHL are official minor leagues to the NHL, with the ECHL subservient to the AHL; the FPHL and SPHL operate as low-level independents.","target":"When the Boston Bruins joined the NHL in 1924, the United States was finally represented in the league","rationale":"The sentence \\"When the Boston Bruins joined the NHL in 1924, the United States was finally represented in the league\\" provides information about which team was first to join the NHL."},{"source":"In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \\n\\nDecide whether \\"Henry the Navigator\\" is a valid answer to the following question: Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago near Lisbon following the orders of which leader?\\nAnswer yes or no.","target":"Yes","rationale":"The text mentions João Gonçalves Zarco, who made the first recorded discovery of Madeira in 1418.

The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia.

She'll be \\"mean\\" in this story, because previously we had rather good relationships, albeit never really spoke. I knew where she lived, that she had a small cute dog, I held doors to her, said hello, helped to carry anything heavy - that sort of neighbory stuff, but we didn't even know each other's names.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have moved to my recent apartment a four years ago and got a dog, and the story takes place about two years ago. Now, early morning one day, someone starts ringing into my door. I try to ignore it - I work nights, so it's my beauty sleep at that time. But they kept ringing, and ringing non-stop, so I shuffled to the door at last, and opened it. It was the mean old lady, and right from the doorstep she starts screaming at me because my dog \\"made a smelly puddle\\" in the hallway. I am groggy, and have no idea what she is talking about, but she insists that my dog sh@t on the floor a few floors below. Now, my dog is a very behaved pupper. She cannot and will not do her things anywhere but grass outside, and even when outside - never near the place we live. She'll yell, and bark, and scream if she has something wrong with her stomach, but she'll hold till she'll explode, but not do her business inside. Not only that, she was at the time scared of the new place she was in, so never left my sight when we walked out, so I always see what she's doing, and she didn't do anything in the apartment complex. Which I explain to the woman: she must be mistaken, because she's always in my range of sight, and she cannot really do her business not on the grass.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe woman, however, insists, and when I ask why does she think it's my dog, she replies \\"Because you're new here!\\". Excuse me, lady, I ask, is that a reason enough to claim my dog shat in the apartment building? The fact I'm living here a few years less than you? \\"Yes.\\" she replies. \\"Because I know everyone else in here, and no one would do that!\\". Which is a weak argument, imo. Well, I tell her, she is mistaken - I kept a close eye on my dog, she didn't do it, so it must be something else. She continues to insist, tries to force me to apologise to the neighbours (tough luck - I'm a stubborn sonofabitch), and tries to drag me out to clean after \\"my dog\\", saying that everyone does that. Which I refuse because a) i'm in my PJs; b) that was not my fucking dog!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI go home, lock myself, and go to sleep, only to be woken up a few more times by her for the same reason, but those times I did not open the door - just pressed a pillow over my ears, and slept to my heart's content.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSoon the landlord came for the pay, and I asked him if the lady is even sane and should I bother about her? He said, no, but just motivated that she's a lonely old woman and a single mother with a forty-something daughter who is obsessed by cats... which is not a reason at all to call a woman crazy! Still, the landlord - spaghetti monster bless him! - likes to get to the root of any conflict I might have with anyone, and after a while he calls me, and tells that he spoke to the lady, they made a sweep of the neighbours, and it appeared that the guy next door was doing some renovations, changing pipes, some mucus and rot spilled out of the pipe he was carrying outside to dispose of, and that was the \\"smelly puddle\\". Alright, I think, the woman next time we meet would admit to her mistake and if not apologise, stop giving me The Look she has been ever since. But she did not. She did not apologise, she was continuing giving me The Look, she continued treating me and my dog as if we were the bane of the complex's existence, huffing and puffing, screaming at my dog whenever she approached (after a while the doggo adjusted and tried to be friendly with every person, pupper, or cat in the building), and continuously scolding me for not having her on the leash and muzzled at all times (which is not required for non-fighter breeds over where I live, and my doggo is just a happy, friendly mutt with some collie in her).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd for some reason i took that to heart. I stopped helping her, stopped holding the door, saying hello (which pisses her off - I hear how she grumbles about \\"young people having no respect\\" when i don't greet her), and other common courtesy. I just filter her out. But recently this cold war got to the point when, if I walk home, and see her walking from the store, I will deliberately walk slower, to get into the apartment building with a really nasty, hard-opening door (the magnetic lock misbehaves), to close it right in front of her.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis all wouldn't have happened were she only to say \\"sorry\\", or at least treat me decently. But it seems like the reveal of her being wrong only intensified her dismay, which I decided to mirror back to her. Not a very manly thing to do, I admit, but I am too stubborn to give up (not to mention it is kind of entertaining). Maybe **I** am the asshole?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR:** old lady neighbour claims my dog shat on the floor in the apartment building because I'm a new tennant (her words), and tries to force me to clean up and apologise to the neighbours; later finds out it was another person's fault, but still continues treat me and my dog as if we were ruining the complex; I decide to be petty and start slamming the doors into her face instead of holding them for her, and things like this.","target":"WRONG","rationale":"The author of the post does not have a good relationship with their neighbors and feels that it is appropriate to slam doors in the face of their elderly neighbor, who has already done enough harm to the author's relationship with the rest of their neighbors.

Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n. It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1. These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. It is implied by the stronger Cramér's conjecture. Question: Which conjecture holds that for any positive integer n, there is an infinite amount of pairs of consecutive primes differing by 2n?","target":"Polignac's conjecture","rationale":"The answer is directly extracted from the passage and it's a single entity, so 'Polignac's conjecture' is the right answer."},{"source":"Write the conversation response.

Montgomery Street in the Financial District became known as the \\"Wall Street of the West\\", home to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Wells Fargo corporate headquarters, and the site of the now-defunct Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. Bank of America, a pioneer in making banking services accessible to the middle class, was founded in San Francisco and in the 1960s, built the landmark modern skyscraper at 555 California Street for its corporate headquarters. Many large financial institutions, multinational banks, and venture capital firms are based in or have regional headquarters in the city. With over 30 international financial institutions, six Fortune 500 companies, and a large support infrastructure of professional services—including law, public relations, architecture and design—San Francisco is designated as an Alpha(-) World City. The 2017 Global Financial Centres Index ranked San Francisco as the sixth most competitive financial center in the world.\\nSince the 1990s, San Francisco's economy has diversified away from finance and tourism towards the growing fields of high tech, biotechnology, and medical research.

The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet Amyntas III eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa.

Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness. \\nQuestion: What architectural style the Angel Choir belongs to?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

In immune cells, Ca2+ signaling is an essential step in many forms of activation. Neutrophil-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one form of leukocyte activation that plays an important role in tumor cell killing in vitro and in patient care. Using fluorescence methodologies, we found that neutrophils exhibit Ca2+ signals during ADCC directed against breast fibrosarcoma cells. Importantly, these signals were localized to Ca2+ microdomains at the neutrophil-to-tumor cell interface where they display dynamic features such as movement, fusion, and fission. These signals were blocked by the intracellular Ca2+ buffer BAPTA. At the neutrophil–tumor cell synapse, the neutrophil’s cytoplasm was enriched in STIM1, a crucial mediator of Ca2+ signaling, whereas the Ca2+-binding proteins calbindin and parvalbumin were not affected. Our findings suggest that Ca2+ microdomains are due to an active signaling process.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment.

Under head coach Curly Lambeau, Hutson led the Packers to four NFL Championship Games, winning three: 1936, 1939, and 1944.\\n\\nHutson has been honored in a variety of ways. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame as a charter member in 1951, and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1968, also as an initial member. His number 14 was the first number retired by the Packers, in a public ceremony at a game at City Stadium on December 2, 1951. Hutson Street in the Packerland Industrial Park in Green Bay is named for him, and in 1994 the Packers named their new state-of-the-art indoor practice facility across the street from Lambeau Field the \\"Don Hutson Center.\\"  Hutson was inducted as a charter member of both the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951, and Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. His college career made him a unanimous choice for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1920-1969 era. Hutson is a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, inducted in 1972 along with his quarterbacks, Arnie Herber and Cecil Isbell. There is a park named after him in his hometown of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. On the occasion of his 75th birthday he performed the ceremonial coin toss of Super Bowl XXII to end the pregame ceremonies. Hutson was named to the NFL's 1930s All-Decade Team and 50th Anniversary Team in 1970, and in 1994 he was named to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1999, he was ranked sixth on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranking Packer and the highest-ranking pre-World War II player. In 2012, the NFL Network named Hutson the greatest Green Bay Packer of all time.  In 2005, the Flagstad family of Green Bay donated to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame an authentic Packers No. 14 jersey worn by Hutson. The jersey was found in a trunk of old uniforms in 1946 at the Rockwood Lodge, the Packers' summer training camp from 1946 to 1949, owned by Melvin and Helen Flagstad. The jersey, a rare NFL artifact valued at over $17,000, was donated by son Daniel Flagstad in memory of his parents.  Hutson's most productive seasons were from 1942 to 1945, a time in which the NFL was severely depleted with many of its most talented players and prospective college athletes serving in the military during World War II. Hutson was classified I-A for the military draft, but had three daughters, so was able to avoid conscription.

Not only is it deadly poisonous --- though that doesn't stop people trying to eat it --- but it is also able to scare off enemies by inflating itself to become much larger than normal, when it is young it even chews on its own brothers and sisters.\\nTiger puffer fish attach their eggs to rocks near the bottom of the sea, often at the mouths of bays. Then the larvae   move to the entries of rivers and lakes once they have grown a little. Then, having put on a lot of weight, they head out to sea. There's no innocent childhood for the puffer fish, as Shin Oikawa of Kyushu University in Japan and his colleagues found out when they put the larvae of tiger puffer fish in the lab and monitored them for two months. They found that the larvae went through three steps in which their metabolic  rates increased dramatically when they reached body weights of 0.002g, 0.01g, and 0.1g. When a larva went through one of these steps, its behavior also changed. For instance, once a larva had passed the first level it would have grown its first tooth and could start attacking larvae that had not yet reached that stage. Similarly, any larva that had reached the 0.01g or 0.1g levels would start attacking lighter larvae.\\nThe researchers noted that the baby fish had a \\"relatively small mouth\\", so rather than swallowing their brothers and sisters whole, they would bite pieces out of them. Despite this limitation, the fish caused plenty of deaths --- up to 12 per cent of the deaths that happened in the lab each day.\\nThose fish that grew fast enough to be able to chew on their fellows had an advantage. The extra food accelerated their growth and development. Tiger puffer fish are likely to be faster and swifter, so they can deal better with enemies.\\nAs the name suggests, puffer fish can inflate to make themselves seem much larger than they really are, thus scaring off enemies.

Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutual unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the dialect continuum being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely Eastern Lombard, a language in Northern Italy's Lombardy region that includes the Bergamasque dialect, would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely standard Italian speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure Sicilian language variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan, Catalan, or French speaker than a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have an greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related Neapolitan language, but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking Sicilian Gallo-Italic, a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the same island as the Sicilian language.\\",\\n\\nanswer the following question.

Since higher frequencies mean more waves passing by each time period than lower frequencies do (in this case comparing two different frequencies while holding time constant), we can conclude that although there are fewer individual waves counted for one wavelength at 5 crests vs 10 crest counts over ten seconds,the total distance covered during both periods was greater because they were moving faster with double"},{"source":"Here is a question about this article: Intergender singles bouts were first fought on a national level in the 1990s.

G-quadruplex structure in a DNA substrate can block its extension by telomerase. We have found that hnRNP A1--which was previously implicated in telomere length regulation--binds to both single-stranded and structured human telomeric repeats, and in the latter case, it disrupts their higher-order structure. Using an in vitro telomerase assay, we observed that depletion of hnRNP A/B proteins from 293 human embryonic kidney cell extracts dramatically reduced telomerase activity, which was fully recovered upon addition of purified recombinant hnRNP A1. This finding suggests that hnRNP A1 functions as an auxiliary, if not essential, factor of telomerase holoenzyme. We further show, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, that hnRNP A1 associates with human telomeres in vivo. We propose that hnRNP A1 stimulates telomere elongation through unwinding of a G-quadruplex or G-G hairpin structure formed at each translocation step.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not include a topic sentence that states the main idea or objective of the research, and it does not have a transition sentence that summarizes the findings and conclusions.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\\n\\nQuery: SELECT DISTINCT ?x0 WHERE {\\n?x0 a ns:film.editor .\\n?x0 ns:film.writer.film ?x1 .\\n?x1 ns:film.film.sequel M1\\n} Question: What film editor wrote M1 's prequel","target":"1","rationale":"This query is correct.

In 1598, Boris Godunov was crowned to the Russian throne, marking the end of the centuries long rule of the Rurik dynasty. While his policies were rather moderate and well-intentioned, his rule was marred by the general perception of its questionable legitimacy and allegations of his involvement in orchestrating the assassination of Dimitri. While Godunov managed to put the opposition to his rule under control, he did not manage to crush it completely. To add to his troubles, the first years of the 17th century were exceptionally cold.

Alterations in the secretion of parathyroid hormone and in the metabolism of vitamin D may contribute to such skeletal changes. To minimize the influence of these factors, quantitative bone histology and measurements of bone formation using double tetracycline labeling were done in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats with MA induced by ammonium chloride (TPTX-A), and in both non-acidotic TPTX (TPTX-C) and intact (C) controls. To evaluate the response of both cortical and trabecular bone to MA, histologic studies were done at three separate sites in the tibia, cortical bone from the mid-shaft, and trabecular bone from the epiphysis and from the metaphysis. Plasma pH was lower in TPTX-A, 7.24 +/- 0.10, than in either TPTX-C, 7.39 +/- 0.03, or C, 7.43 +/- 0.04, P less than 0.01, and urinary hydroxyproline excretion increased from 89.8 +/- 8.7 in TPTX-C to 150.2 +/- 25.9 micrograms/mg/creatinine in TPTX-A, P less than 0.01. Resorption surface at the epiphysis increased from 1.8 +/- 0.6% in TPTX-C to 4.0 +/- 1.6% in TPTX-A, P less than 0.05, values not different from those in C, 3.1 +/- 1.1%. Resorption surface was unchanged at other skeletal sites, but total bone volume at the metaphysis fell from 15.5 +/- 5.6% in TPTX-C to 9.0 +/- 4.3% in TPTX-A, P less than 0.05. Bone formation was reduced at each skeletal site in TPTX-A vs. TPTX-C, P less than 0.05 for all values, but histologic evidence of osteomalacia was not observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that was done to evaluate the effect of metabolic acidosis on bone metabolism by measuring plasma pH, urinary hydroxyproline excretion, and resorption surface in cortical and trabecular bones.

Passage:Kepler's first major astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery, 1596), was the first published defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19, 1595, while teaching in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found that each of the five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively—octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.","target":"a","rationale":"The question asks for a comparison of the masses of two planets and information about the mass of Saturn is mentioned directly in the passage as \\"Saturn\\".

The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go.

While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services.

Big town used them to make plastics and related materials, but didn't use it for gas, because they were environmentally conscious and used only electric vehicles for transportation. Fair town used petroleum for fuel mostly.\\n\\nHint: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.","target":"Big","rationale":"The question asks, \\"Which town used less fuel for airplanes?\\" The paragraph states that Big Town uses petroleum products to make plastics and related materials.

The settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless the Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in its attempts to do so. Amboina was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on Malacca the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favorable monsoon winds. The Dutch found what they were looking for in Jakarta, conquered by Jan Coen in 1619, later renamed Batavia after the putative Dutch ancestors the Batavians, and which would become the capital of the Dutch East Indies.

He is noted for bringing Notre Dame's Fighting Irish football program from years of futility back into a national contender in 1964 and is widely regarded alongside Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy as a part of the \\"Holy Trinity\\" of Notre Dame head coaches. Parseghian grew up in Akron, Ohio, and played football beginning in his junior year of high school. He enrolled at the University of Akron, but soon quit to join the U.S. Navy for two years during World War II.\\n\\nIn 1966, Parseghian guided Notre Dame to its first national championship since the Leahy era. Led by quarterback Terry Hanratty, running back Nick Eddy, star receiver Jim Seymour, and fullback Larry Conjar, the offense was best in the nation in scoring, with an average of 36.2 points per game. The defense was second in the country in points allowed, thanks to strong performances by linebacker Jim Lynch and defensive end Alan Page.  The season began with eight straight victories, propelling Notre Dame to the top of the national polls. The team then faced Michigan State (who had Bubba Smith), which ranked second in the polls and was also undefeated. The contest, one among a number referred to as the \\"game of the century\\", ended in a 10-10 tie. Parseghian was criticized for winding down the clock instead of trying to score despite having the ball in the final seconds of the game. He defended his strategy by maintaining that several key starters had been knocked out of action early in the game and that he did not want to spoil a courageous comeback from a 10-0 deficit by risking a turnover deep in his own territory late in the game. When Parseghian's team trounced USC 51-0 the following week, critics alleged that he ran up the score to impress poll voters who had split the number-one ranking between Notre Dame and Michigan State following the tie. Subsequent to the USC rout, the final wire service polls gave Parseghian's team the national championship, although Notre Dame did not participate in a post-season bowl game. Nine members of the team were selected as All-Americans, and Parseghian was named coach of the year by Sporting News.  Several winning seasons followed, but Notre Dame did not repeat as national champion in the late 1960s. In 1969, the team finished with an 8-2-1 record and accepted an invitation to play in the postseason Cotton Bowl. With this game, the school ended a long-standing policy of not playing in bowl games. The university urgently needed money to fund minority scholarships and decided to use the proceeds from bowl games for this purpose. Parseghian's team lost the game, 21-17, to the eventual national champion Texas Longhorns.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: When did ara parseghian win his first title.","target":"In 1966,","rationale":"In 1966, Parseghian guided Notre Dame to its first national championship since the Leahy era.

Some suggest his birth year as 1950 or 1953, or as late as around 1966. According to a \\"surprise biography\\" published by the Taliban in April 2015, he was born in 1960. His exact place of birth is also uncertain; one possibility is a village called Nodeh near the city of Kandahar.\\n\\nOn 4 April 1996, supporters of Mullah Omar bestowed on him the title Amir al-Mu'minin ('myr lmw'mnyn, \\"Commander of the Faithful\\"), after he donned a cloak alleged to be that of Muhammad that was locked in a series of chests, held inside the Shrine of the Cloak in the city of Kandahar. Legend decreed that whoever could retrieve the cloak from the chest would be the great Leader of the Muslims, or \\"Amir al-Mu'minin\\".  In September 1996, Kabul fell to Mullah Omar and his followers. The civil war continued in the northeast corner of the country, near Tajikistan. The nation was named the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in October 1997 and was recognized by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Described as a \\"reclusive, pious and frugal\\" leader, Omar very seldom left his residence in the city of Kandahar, and visited Kabul only twice between 1996 and 2001 during his tenure as ruler of Afghanistan. In November 2001, during a radio interview with the BBC, Omar stated: \\"All Taliban are moderate. There are two things: extremism ['ifraat', or doing something to excess] and conservatism ['tafreet', or doing something insufficiently]. So in that sense, we are all moderates - taking the middle path.\\"  According to Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, Mullah Omar stated in the late 1990s, \\"We have told Osama [Bin Laden] not to use Afghan soil to carry out political activities as it creates unnecessary confusion about Taliban objectives.\\"  In 1998, despite receiving a personal invitation from Saudi Arabia's ruler, King Fahd, Omar refused to make a pilgrimage to Mecca and wouldn't do one in his lifetime.  Mullah Omar was also \\"Head of the Supreme Council of Afghanistan\\".  In July 1999, Mullah Mohammed Omar issued a decree in favor of the preservation of the Bamiyan Buddha statues. Because Afghanistan's Buddhist population no longer exists, so the statues are no longer worshiped, he added: \\"The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors. The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but protected.\\"  In early 2000, local Taliban authorities asked for UN assistance to rebuild drainage ditches around tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set.  In March 2001, the Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban under an edict issued from Mullah Omar, stating: \\"all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.\\" This prompted an international outcry. Information and Culture Minister Qadratullah Jamal told Associated Press of a decision by 400 religious clerics from across Afghanistan declaring the Buddhist statues against the tenets of Islam. \\"They came out with a consensus that the statues were against Islam,\\" said Jamal. A statement issued by the ministry of religious affairs of the Taliban regime justified the destruction as being in accordance with Islamic law. The then Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salam Zaeef held that the destruction of the Buddhas was finally ordered by Abdul Wali, the Minister for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.  The Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar explained why he ordered the statues to be destroyed in an interview:  I did not want to destroy the Bamiyan Buddha. In fact, some foreigners came to me and said they would like to conduct the repair work of the Bamiyan Buddha that had been slightly damaged due to rains. This shocked me. I thought, these callous people have no regard for thousands of living human beings - the Afghans who are dying of hunger, but they are so concerned about non-living objects like the Buddha. This was extremely deplorable. That is why I ordered its destruction. Had they come for humanitarian work, I would have never ordered the Buddha's destruction.

The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese being the only continuous member until his death in January 2015. The best known line-up of the group was its mid-70s trio of Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In the late 1970s, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann.\\n\\nEdgar Froese arrived in West Berlin in the mid-1960s to study art. His first band, the psychedelic rock-styled The Ones, disbanded after releasing only one single. After The Ones, Froese experimented with musical ideas, playing smaller gigs with a variety of musicians. Most of these performances were in the famous Zodiak Free Arts Lab, although one grouping also had the distinction of being invited to play for the surrealist painter Salvador Dali. The music was partnered with literature, painting, early forms of multimedia, and more. It seemed as though only the most outlandish ideas attracted any attention, leading Froese to comment, \\"In the absurd often lies what is artistically possible.\\" As members of the group came and went, the direction of the music continued to be inspired by the Surrealists, and the group came to be called by the surreal-sounding name of Tangerine Dream, inspired by the line \\"tangerine trees and marmalade skies\\" from The Beatles' track \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\"  Froese was fascinated by technology and skilled in using it to create music. He built custom-made instruments and, wherever he went, collected sounds with tape recorders for use in constructing musical works later. His early work with tape loops and other repeating sounds was the obvious precursor to the emerging technology of the sequencer, which Tangerine Dream quickly adopted upon its arrival.  The first Tangerine Dream album, Electronic Meditation, was a tape-collage Krautrock piece, using the technology of the time rather than the synthesized music they later became famous for. The line-up for the album was Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler. Electronic Meditation was published by Ohr in 1970, and began the period known as the Pink Years (the Ohr logo was a pink ear). But starting with their second album, Alpha Centauri, the group has been a trio or occasionally duo of electronic instruments, commonly augmented by guitar from Froese (or, much later, other musicians as well), and occasionally also other instruments. Of these, drums from Christopher Franke and organ from Steve Schroyder (on Alpha Centauri) or Peter Baumann (on subsequent releases) feature prominently in the band's music during the early 70s. They also started their heavy usage of the Mellotron during this period.\\n\\nwere they well-received?","target":"one grouping also had the distinction of being invited to play for the surrealist painter Salvador Dali.","rationale":"Although most of their performances were in the famous Zodiak Free Arts Lab, one grouping also had the distinction of being invited to play for the surrealist painter Salvador Dali.

Then it may be said that the coil has lengthened the antenna to achieve an electrical length of 2.5 meters. However, the resulting resistive impedance achieved will be quite a bit lower than the impedance of a resonant monopole, likely requiring further impedance matching. In addition to a lower radiation resistance, the reactance becomes higher as the antenna size is reduced, and the resonant circuit formed by the antenna and the tuning coil has a Q factor that rises and eventually causes the bandwidth of the antenna to be inadequate for the signal being transmitted. This is the major factor that sets the size of antennas at 1 MHz and lower frequencies.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"lower","rationale":"When the antenna size is reduced, we add a loading coil to adjust its electrical length.

For example, if there are 20 melanocytes and they produce 2 units of melanin each then this would be a total of 40 units produced by the person's cells (20 x 2 = 40). If you increase the number to 30 but keep their individual productivity at 2 then now you have 60 (30 x2 =60) which is an increase from before so we can say that it has increased overall even though individually they produced the same amount as before."},{"source":"Read this article and answer this question Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze   was a Georgian nobleman and King of Imereti as George VI  from 1702 to 1707. He was a member of the prominent Abashidze family. The youngest son of Prince Paata Abashidze, he was served as a priest until about 1684 when he entered politics after the death of his elder brother Paata Abashidze and began aggressively expanding his patrimonial fiefdom. He dispossessed the Chkheidze family of Shorapani, and the Agiashvili of Tsutskhvati, and took control of the royal domain in Upper Imereti. His daughter, Tamar, was married to the two successive kings of Imereti, Alexander IV and George V. During the reign of the latter monarch, Abashidze effectively ran the government and acted as an all-powerful kingmaker. In 1699, he gave his daughter Anika in marriage to King Simon of Imereti, but they divorced in 1700. In 1701, Abashidze compelled King Mamia of Imereti to abdicate and seized the throne for himself. He managed to establish a degree of stability in Imereti and ceased to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire, triggering a military response in 1703. He also patronized culture and learning. Deposed after a revolt by the nobles, in favour of the rightful Bagrationi king George VII, Abashidze took refuge at the court of Vakhtang VI of Kartli in Tbilisi. He died there in 1722, and was buried in the Katskhi monastery in Imereti.\\nHow many years did the marriage of Anika and King Simpon last?","target":"1","rationale":"The answer is 1 year. Abashidze gave his daughter Anika in marriage to King Simon of Imereti, but they divorced in 1700 (step1). In other words, their marriage lasted from 1699 until 1700. Therefore we could say that the length was one year (step2)."},{"source":"Given the following passage\\n\\n\\"Miami's tropical weather allows for year-round outdoors activities.

Three years later, he moved his operations at Coolgardie, where a promising gold field had been just discovered. Sitting at the town council, he was elected on 3 August 1896 one of the three members of the Western Australian Legislative Council for the East Province. He was one of the ten Western Australia representatives at the 1897-1898 Australasian Federal Convention, which prepared the federation. He left the council in 1899 to focus on speculative developments.

The conviction resulted in the suspension of Monk's cabaret card, the permit required by performers in New York for work in nightclubs. Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s. Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, led an appeal on the pianist's behalf in front of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to have his card restored. Colomby argued to the SLA that Monk was \\"a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician\\".In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, prompting Colomby to consider the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. \\"I wanted to find a place that was small\\", he later said. \\"I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out.\\" Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in the reinstatement of his cabaret card and his employment at the Five Spot Café. In his first stable job in years, Monk helped transform the small bar into one of the city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of the pianist's music. With the residency, he had finally found jazz stardom after twenty years of career struggles and obscurity.Monk began his first stint at the venue in July 1957, with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time it ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left in pursuit of a solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group.

I charge her only $500 all inclusive, meaning her portion of the light bill and everything else + rent is all in one. We live in a nice 3bed/2bath house, approx. 1500 SF. All things considered, she is a great roommate. Takes care of our dogs while we're gone or at work and she's home, cleans up after herself, and gets in cleaning moods like I do which helps keeps things tidy. Plus, we've been friends for like 7+ years and she's a really cool chick that I get along with and can just shoot the shit with.   \\n\\n\\nHowever, I have had issues with her lately. At first, it was no big deal, but I feel as though she's grown too comfortable living all inclusive. The main issues are her either forgetting huge loads of trash that need to be out for trash pickup, leaving the lights on when she leaves a room or leaves the house, and running the heater too much. The trash will stink up the whole house, mainly because she will throw her old food out and it will sit there while we're both at work. Minor inconvenience, but still something I feel like she should have a little more responsibility over. In regards to the lights and heat, she knows, or at least by my assumption knows, that I am very frugal when it comes to saving $$. I constantly have to make sure lights aren't left on before we go to bed, and have to walk behind her in the kitchen/common areas. I don't run the heat unless it is god awful cold in the house, because we all have a shit ton of blankets and she has a space heater (of which I am paranoid about because she leaves the light on, who says she doesn't leave that plugged in). I have since justified turning the heater on for shower purposes, but for me - I turn it off as soon as I get out, she leaves it running for 30+ minutes longer. That shit costs money, and it's much more than my usual electric bill. I used to average $60 a month, maybe $85 in the summertime, and since she has moved in it has constantly been above $130. Highest was $190 and I almost had a stroke. It was understood that in order for me to continue letting her rent at only $500 that everything else be kept in check. Other than money reasons, would you not suggest it's common courtesy since she's renting from me and it's my house?  \\n\\n\\nLast night, my SO and I had gotten home first, assuming roomie was at the gym. Nobody was home, we got in the shower, and then got out to go knock out dishes. We were talking about how it just aggravates me that I feel that simple requests go undone, and I said something along the lines of: 'she really has no idea what she's in for when she moves out because $500 all inclusive seems like a steal to me. I don't feel like I'm asking much. Her and (boyfriend) are in for a rude awakening when they come to find out they'll need to work 2-3 jobs and probably still live paycheck to paycheck (because rent in other places outrageous even being a college town). But to each his own'. Now, what I said I don't feel like was mean, but if she DID hear us, she also didn't get the full context of the conversation that we had in the car. I had an extremely bad day, so admittedly my tone probably sounded bossy and distraught. She's not the type to confront me about what she heard, but rather it will go unsaid and there will just be obvious tension. My SO was about 10ft from me in a different room, talking about a different subject, and then he heard her cough. Instant lump in my throat because I want to explain myself based on the misconception of what she may have heard.  \\n\\n\\nNow, I've received feedback stating that maybe I'm just being an overly-OCD asshole landlord, but I don't feel as so. Maybe you can offer more feedback or offer similar situation that you have been in. I really try very hard not to be so nit-picky and asshole-ish, but I feel like my behavior and reactions are justified because it doesn't make sense to hike up my electric bill while her rent would not change.  \\n\\n\\nThoughts?  \\n\\n\\nTL;DR roommate has gotten very lax with her living responsibilities; I have voiced it to my SO many times; we were having an in-depth conversation about her, only to find out she was home the entire time basically and we are 99% sure she heard us.

She successfully \\"crossed over\\" to pop music and was one of the most influential, successful, and acclaimed vocalists of the 20th century. She died at age 30 in the crash of a private airplane. Cline was known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice, and her role as a country music pioneer.\\n\\nBill Peer, her second manager, gave her the name Patsy, from her middle name, Patterson. (Bill Peer, who had a country music band in Brunswick, MD, also had an infant daughter named Patsy). In 1955 he gained a contract for her at Four Star Records, the label he was then affiliated with. Four Star was under contract to the Coral subsidiary of Decca Records. Patsy signed with Decca at her first opportunity three years later.  Her first contract allowed her to record compositions only by Four Star writers, which Cline found limiting. Later, she expressed regret over signing with the label, but thinking that nobody else would have her, she took the deal. Her first record for Four Star was \\"A Church, A Courtroom & Then Good-Bye,\\" which attracted little attention, although it led to appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. As these performances were not \\"records\\" per se, they were not governed by her contract, and she could sing what she wanted, within reason. This somewhat eased her \\"stifled\\" feeling.  Between 1955 and 1957, Cline recorded honky tonk material, with songs like \\"Fingerprints,\\" \\"Pick Me Up On Your Way Down,\\" \\"Don't Ever Leave Me Again,\\" and \\"A Stranger In My Arms.\\" Cline co-wrote the last two. None of these songs gained notable success. She experimented with rockabilly.  According to Decca Records producer Owen Bradley, the Four Star compositions only hinted at Patsy's potential. Bradley thought that her voice was best-suited for pop music, but Cline sided with Peer and the other Four Star producers, insisting that she could only record country songs, as her contract also stated. Every time Bradley tried to get her to sing the torch songs that would become her signature, she would panic, missing her familiar country fiddle and steel guitar.

Sixty-three fecal samples from diarrheic calves were collected from November 1999 to May 2000 and screened by LAT, the Rotazyme II enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and virus isolation (VI) followed by an anti-rotavirus fluorescent-antibody (FA) test to detect the presence of group A rotavirus antigen. Of the 63 samples screened by VI-FA, 33 (58%) tested positive for rotavirus antigen. When the results from the LAT were compared to those from VI-FA, the \\"gold standard\\" for detection of bovine rotavirus in fecal samples, the sensitivity and specificity were found to be 87.8 and 73.3%, respectively. Latex agglutination compared with ELISA (the reference method) showed 100% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity, and when ELISA was compared with VI, the sensitivity was 84.8% and the specificity was 73.3%. Latex agglutination is easy to perform in a short time and does not require expensive equipment or skilled personnel, and the reagents have long shelf lives.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave.

The film scored a 35% \\"Rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus stated \\"Less nuanced than its source material, Memoirs of a Geisha may be a lavish production, but it still carries the simplistic air of a soap opera.\\" On Metacritic, the film was given a 54/100 meaning \\"mixed or average review.\\"  In the United States, the film managed $57 million during its box office run.

Since each space is 1 square foot and there are 145 spaces, we have a rectangle with dimensions 12 x 145. We want to divide this rectangle into 1 square foot squares (the size of each tree). We can do this by cutting it up into rectangles that have dimensions 1 x 12 and then rearranging them in rows of length 13 (since 13 * 1 = 13). This gives us a total of 11 rows, so 11 * 13 = 143 trees will fit on the sidewalk with no extra room left over (11*12 +1=143). However, since we only need to cut up one side of the rectangle and not both sides, we have another row at the end that can hold an additional 5 trees in a row without having to rearrange them since 5 * 1 < 5 *12/2 .

It is commonly found on Unix-like systems and functions as both a file synchronization and file transfer program. The rsync algorithm is a type of delta encoding, and is used for minimizing network usage. Zlib may be used for additional compression, and SSH or stunnel can be used for data security.\\n\\n- On Microsoft Servers, a domain controller (DC) is a server computer that responds to security authentication requests (logging in, checking permissions, etc.) within a Windows domain. A \\"domain\\" is a concept introduced in Windows NT whereby a user may be granted access to a number of computer resources with the use of a single username and password combination.\\n\\n- In computing, a file server (or fileserver) is a computer attached to a network that has the primary purpose of providing a location for shared disk access, i.e. shared storage of computer files (such as documents, sound files, photographs, movies, images, databases, etc.) that can be accessed by the workstations that are attached to the same computer network. The term \\"server\\" highlights the role of the machine in the clientserver scheme, where the \\"clients\\" are the workstations using the storage. A file server is not intended to perform computational tasks, and does not run programs on behalf of its clients.\\nIt is designed primarily to enable the storage and retrieval of data while the computation is carried out by the workstations.\\n\\n- Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks.

Samba provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Microsoft Windows Server domain , either as a Domain Controller ( DC ) or as a domain member . As of version 4 , it supports Active Directory and Microsoft Windows NT domains . Samba runs on most Unix , OpenVMS and Unix - like systems , such as Linux , Solaris , AIX and the BSD variants , including Apple 's OS X Server , and OS X client ( version 10.2 and greater ) . Samba is standard on nearly all distributions of Linux and is commonly included as a basic system service on other Unix - based operating systems as well . Samba is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License . The name Samba comes from SMB ( Server Message Block ) , the name of the standard protocol used by the Microsoft Windows network file system .\\n\\n- Andrew \\"Tridge\\" Tridgell (born 28 February 1967) is an Australian computer programmer.

Authentication takes place on domain controllers. Each person who uses computers within a domain receives a unique user account that can then be assigned access to resources within the domain. Starting with Windows 2000, Active Directory is the Windows component in charge of maintaining that central database. The concept of Windows domain is in contrast with that of a workgroup in which each computer maintains its own database of security principals.\\n\\n- Samba is a Brazilian musical genre and dance style, with its roots in Africa via the West African slave trade and African religious traditions, particularly of Angola and the Congo, through the samba de roda genre of the northeastern state of Bahia, from which it derived.

It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors.

On the way to the prom, Mitch takes Lindsey to the cemetery to \\"loosen up\\" and makes out with her. Mitch is drawn out of the car and killed by a zombie then turns into one himself. Meanwhile, members of the school's SciFi club, Jules, Steven, Rod and George, are investigating the cemetery when they are attacked. Rod is killed and the remaining three are rescued by a grave digger who reveals that he was aware of the occurrences but kept it quiet to keep his job. He instructs them on how to kill the zombies before running off. The three get surrounded again, but Lindsey comes to the rescue and they all escape in Mitch's car.\\nAfter making a pizza delivery and discovering that a family are now zombies, Jimmy finds a crashed truck with his enemy Kyle as the only survivor. Jimmy and Kyle run into a cheerleader named Gwen, and the three are attacked. They manage to kill all of the zombies with a bat they find and a gun Kyle carries in his truck. Unfortunately Jimmy's truck is stolen by two zombies, leaving the three without a getaway vehicle. In another neighborhood, Nash Rambler (Blair Redford), Jensen and Dave the Drummer are in the middle of writing a new song for their band. Nash asks Jensen to open the garage door to let in some air because Jensen has been smoking pot, and they discover zombies when Jensen opens the garage door.

The clash of metal rang through the forest. An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \\"He bit me.\\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart. Lorfel saw the gleaming arrow head sticking almost a foot out of his companion's back. Ranur fell face first to the ground.\\nQuestion: From what or whom did the roar came from?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. Char\\n\\nB. not enough information\\n\\nC. A beast\\n\\nD. Ranur","target":"C","rationale":"The context describes a scene where three hunters, Char, Lorfel and Ranur are hunting in the woods. There is an encounter with something that results in one of them getting bit by what they refer to as \\"a beast\\". The question asks who or what made a roar after someone was hurt. Based on this it can be concluded that the answer choice “C” is most likely correct because when people get injured animals often make noise such as roaring which would indicate pain being caused from another animal thus inferring that option C “A beast” fits best for the answer given this situation."},{"source":"Next question: who has the highest elo rating in chess?","target":"Magnus Carlsen","rationale":"The highest Elo rating in chess ever achieved was 2882, which was attained by Magnus Carlsen on May 3rd 2014\\nTherefore, the answer should be \\"Magnus Carlsen\\"."},{"source":"\\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\"\\nHe had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child.

That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war.\\nBut there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier.\\nThe date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire.

On 28-30 July, a combined Brandenburgian-Swedish army was able to defeat the Polish-Lithuanian army in the Battle of Warsaw, forcing John II Casimir to retreat to Lublin. In August, Alexis' army took Livonian Kokenhausen , laid siege to Riga and Dorpat and raided Estonia, Ingria and Kexholm. On 4 October, John II Casimir stormed eczyca in Greater Poland before heading for Royal Prussia, and on 8 October, Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski with 12,000 to 13,000 Lithuanian and Crimean Tartar cavalry overran a Brandenburgian-Swedish force in the Battle of Prostken in Ducal Prussia. Gosiewski then ravaged Ducal Prussia, burning 13 towns and 250 villages, in a campaign that entered folklore because of the high death toll and the high number of captives deported to the Crimea. On 22 October, Gosiewski was defeated by Swedish forces in the Battle of Filipow and turned to Lithuania. Also on 22 October, besieged Dorpat surrendered to Alexis, while the Russian siege of Swedish-held Riga was lifted. John II Casimir meanwhile took Bromberg and Konitz in Royal Prussia, and from 15 November 1656 until February 1657 stayed in Danzig, where a Swedish siege had to be lifted due to Dutch intervention, just 55 kilometers away from Charles X Gustav's quarters in Elbing. \\n Question: What happened second: Battle of Warsaw or Casimir stormed eczyca?","target":"casimir stormed łęczyca","rationale":"The battle of Warsaw happened first.

The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which student learned less about fuels for airplanes?","target":"Dan","rationale":"Given the information in the background section, we know that fuels used for airplanes are a type of petroleum product.

Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry.

As is the case with most dinosaurs, the skeleton of Parasaurolophus is incompletely known. The length of the type specimen of P. walkeri is estimated at 9.5 meters (31 ft). What environment did a parasaurolophus live in? Parasaurolophus lived along the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway. The area was a floodplain with rivers and swamps, and had distinct wet and dry seasons. Conifers …were the primary trees, but other plants like ferns, ginkgoes, cycads, and flowering plants also lived there. Brachiosaurus was an unusual dinosaur that lived 155.7 million to 150.8 million years ago during the mid- to late Jurassic Period. Specimens have been found primarily in the fossil-rich Morrison Formation in North America, but the dinosaur did not resemble any of the others that roamed the region. Its long neck made it look like a giraffe, and its forelegs were longer than its hind legs. The name Brachiosaurus, in fact, means arm lizard.. When did dinosaurs live? Dinosaurs lived between about 247 and 66 million years ago, in a time known as the Mesozoic Era. This was many millions of years before the first modern humans, Homo sapiens, appeared. Scientists divide the Mesozoic Era into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. What period did the parasaurolophus live? Parasaurolophus lived from about 76.5 to 73 million years ago. This was near the end of the Cretaceous period, the last period in the Mesozoic era. Parasaurolophus Facts. 1  Check out our Parasaurolophus facts for kids. The Parasaurolophus was an interesting dinosaur with a strangely shaped head that featured a curved crest. 2  Read on and learn more cool information about the Parasaurolophus, including where it lived, how long it was, the function of its strange looking crest and much more. Parasaurolophus lived in the late Cretaceous Period, around 75 million years ago, in what is now North America. Fossils have been found in Alberta, Canada as well as Utah and New Mexico, USA. The Parasaurolophus was first described by William Parks in 1922, two years after a partial skeleton and skull were found in Alberta. Parasaurolophus were herbivores (plant eaters). It could walk on either two legs or all four.

They were herbivores (plant eaters) that used their strong back legs to reach higher branches. Find out more about the Cretaceous plants they ate. Where did they live? How big were they? They were 10 metres (33 feet) in length and weighed 3.5 tons. Their huge head crest could grow to 1.8 metres long. Kids-Dinosaurs › Parasaurolophus Parasaurolophus was a herbivore, eating pine needles, leaves, and twigs. Fossilized stomach contents show that it ate mostly land plants. With its long neck, parasaurolophus would have been able to find food on the ground or in trees. Parasaurolophus was a member of the duckbill family of dinosaurs, meaning it had a hard beak in the front of its mouth and hundreds of teeth in the back for chewing tough plant material. Parasaurolophus lived during the late Cretaceous period, about 76-65 Million years ago. Other dinosaurs living in the late Cretaceous in North America were Albertosaurus, Nanotyrannus, Lambeosaurus (another hadrosaur), Euoplocephalus, Kritosaurus, and Pachyrhinosaurus.Parasaurolophus was named by Dr. William A. Parks in 1922 from a skeleton found in Alberta, Canada.

A fever really does not last more than 2-3 days, unless there is a major underlying cause. It is important to take the individual to the doctor if the fever is extremely high or lasting more than the normal amount of time. While the average baseline for a body temperature is 98.6 F, some variation is allowed for determining a person’s fever. These people include: 1  the very young. 2  people 65 or older. 3  people with chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, HIV, or diabetes. 4  pregnant women. 5  people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher. The flu vaccine is a specific and effective way to prevent the flu. It is available for children over 6 months old. Children under 9 years old need two doses of the vaccine the first year they get it. The flu can take many forms. Classically, the flu begins abruptly, with a fever in the 102 to 106 degree range, a flushed face, body aches, and marked lack of energy. Some people have other systemic symptoms such as dizziness or vomiting. The fever usually lasts for a day or two, but can last five days. Somewhere between day 2 and day 4 of the illness, the “whole body” symptoms begin to subside, and respiratory symptoms begin to increase. How long does a fever last? Pyrexia is the proper medical term for a fever. To be classified as a fever, one’s body temperature must be above the normal 98.6. Some people in the medical community do not believe that it is a true fever unless the body temperature rises above 101 degrees. If you get the flu, you should get rest and drink plenty of fluids. 1  Take pain relievers to lower your fever and relieve the aches, such as: 2  acetaminophen (Tylenol) 3  ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) 4  naproxen (Aleve) Popular Posts. 1  How Long Does Mail Take. 2  How Long Does The Flu Last. 3  How Long Does Suboxone Stay in Your System. 4  How Long Does It Take To Get Mri Results. 5  How Long Does It Take To Digest A Meal. 6  How Long Does It Take To Become An Architect. 7  How Long Does It Take To Lower Blood Pressure. Some people are at increased risk for complications from influenza. 1  These people include: 2  the very young. 3  people 65 or older. 4  people with chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, HIV, or diabetes. 5  pregnant women. 6  people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher. While it is unclear when the fever begins what the body is really fighting, the real test is to ensure that it does not last more than 3 days. A fever that lasts 10-15 days is called a prolonged fever. While a fever is certainly not something to mess around with, there is now way to definitively state the answer to the question on most sufferers minds, how long does a fever last? Anything over 3 days needs medication attention to make sure that there is nothing more serious underlying. How long does it last? Inhaling droplets from coughs or sneezes is the most common way to catch the flu. Symptoms appear 1 to 7 days later (usually 2 to 3 days). Symptoms (except the cough) usually disappear within 4 to 7 days. Sometimes there is a second wave of fever at this time. The cough and tiredness usually lasts for weeks after the rest of the illness is over.

In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date.

A smooth car tire will last longer on a road because its treads don't wear down due to coming into direct contact with rocks or other debris. Similarly, if you are cutting wood using some type of saw blade then one made out of steel instead plastic might cut through faster; but not only do they cost more money"},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- Carl W.

Daffy was one of the first of the new \\"screwball\\" characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier in the decade, such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye. Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the \\"Looney Tunes\\"/\\"Merrie Melodies\\" cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 180 appearances and Porky Pig's 162 appearances.\\n\\n- Frederick Bean \\"Tex\\" Avery (February 26, 1908  August 26, 1980) was an American animator, cartoonist, voice actor and director, known for producing animated cartoons during the golden age of American animation.

He was created in 1943 by Tex Avery for theatrical cartoon shorts produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio. Essentially the polar opposite of Avery's other famous MGM character, the loud and wacky Screwy Squirrel, Droopy moves slowly and lethargically, speaks in a jowly monotone voice, andthough hardly an imposing characteris shrewd enough to outwit his enemies. When finally roused to anger, often by a bad guy laughing heartily at him, Droopy is capable of beating adversaries many times his size with a comical thrashing (\\"You know what?

The 475 amino acid sequence of AtxA reveals DNA binding motifs and regions similar to proteins associated with the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). We used strains producing native and functional epitope-tagged AtxA proteins to examine protein-protein interactions in cell lysates and in solutions of purified protein. Co-affinity purification, non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and bis(maleimido)hexane (BMH) cross-linking experiments revealed AtxA homo-multimers. Dimers were the most abundant species. BMH cross-links available cysteines within 13 A. To localize interaction sites, six AtxA mutants containing distinct CysSer substitutions were tested for multimerization and cross-linking. All mutants multimerized, but one mutation, C402S, prevented cross-linking. Thus, BMH uses C402 to make the inter-molecular bond between AtxA proteins, but C402 is not required for protein-protein interaction. C402 is in a region bearing amino acid similarity to Enzyme IIB proteins of the PTS. The AtxA EIIB motif may function in protein oligomerization. Finally, cultures grown with elevated CO(2) /bicarbonate exhibited increased AtxA dimer/monomer ratios and increased AtxA activity, relative to cultures grown without added CO(2) /bicarbonate, suggesting that this host-associated signal enhances AtxA function by shifting the dimer/monomer equilibrium towards the dimeric state. \\n Question: Which metabolite activates AtxA?","target":"bicarbonate","rationale":"The word \\"bicarbonate\\" is mentioned in the context passage."},{"source":"Multi-choice problem: Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable?\\n\\nI climbed right up the tree.\\nOPTIONS:\\n- unacceptable\\n- acceptable","target":"acceptable","rationale":"The sentence \\"I climbed right up the tree\\" is an acceptable English language sentence."},{"source":"You are given a question title.

Cruella therefore mends her working relationship with her valet Alonzo and has him lock away all her fur coats.

Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy's subjects are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their original states but conceals this discovery. Inevitably, when Big Ben rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality and enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal 102 Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood, specifically modifying the original design to use Dipstick's children.","target":"Chloe","rationale":"The paragraph describes Cruella De Vil's release from prison.

HBoV was detected in 4 out of 66 patients. Two of the HBoV-positive infants were co-infected with other viruses. The principal clinical findings in HBoV-positive children were: nasal obstruction, catarrh, cough, fever and dyspnea.

Using a fine of two British ships by the mayor of Rangoon as the excuse, Lord Dalhousie, governor-general of India, sent an ultimatum to rescind the fine, remove the offending mayor, and pay a fine of a one thousand pounds. The Burmese neither wanted nor were ready for a war. They quickly accepted the British demands. But the British officer on the scene, Commodore George Lambert, blockaded the port of Rangoon anyway. On 18 February 1852, Dalhousie increased the demand a hundredfold to one hundred thousand pounds sterling. On 12 April 1852, the British navy invaded Rangoon. King Pagan sent four armies to meet the enemy. The Burmese put up tough resistance at Bassein  and Pegu but by June, much of Lower Burma belonged to the invaders.

However, scientists think that matter that emits light makes up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter, about 80%, is dark matter. Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation, so we cant observe it directly. However, astronomers know that dark matter exists because its gravity affects the motion of objects around it. When astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate, they find that the outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than they can see. Gravitational lensing occurs when light is bent from a very distant bright source around a super-massive object (Figure 1.1). To explain strong gravitational lensing, more matter than is observed must be present. With so little to go on, astronomers dont really know much about the nature of dark matter. One possibility is that it could just be ordinary matter that does not emit radiation in objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and brown dwarfs objects larger than Jupiter but smaller than the smallest stars. But astronomers cannot find enough of these types of objects, which they have named MACHOs (massive astrophyiscal compact halo object), to account for all the dark matter, so they are thought to be only a small part of the total. Another possibility is that the dark matter is very different from the ordinary matter we see. Some appear to be particles that have gravity, but dont otherwise appear to interact with other particles. Scientists call these theoretical particles WIMPs, which stands for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles. Most scientists who study dark matter think that the dark matter in the universe is a combination of MACHOs and some type of exotic matter, such as WIMPs. Researching dark matter is an active area of scientific research, and astronomers knowledge about dark matter is changing rapidly. Astronomers who study the expansion of the universe are interested in knowing the rate of that expansion. Is the rate fast enough to overcome the attractive pull of gravity? If yes, then the universe will expand forever, although the expansion will slow down over time. If no, then the universe would someday start to contract, and eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang. Recently, astronomers have made a discovery that answers that question: the rate at which the universe is expanding is actually increasing. In other words, the universe is expanding faster now than ever before, and in the future it will expand even faster. So now astronomers think that the universe will keep expanding forever. But it also proposes a perplexing new question: what is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate? One possible hypothesis involves a new, hypothetical form of energy called dark energy (Figure 1.2). Some scientists think that dark energy makes up as much as 71% of the total energy content of the universe. Today matter makes up a small percentage of the universe, but at the start of the universe it made up much more. Where did dark energy, if it even exists, come from? Other scientists have other hypotheses about why the universe is continuing to expand; the causes of the universes expansion is another unanswered question that scientists are researching.

Although she resents Love, she finds herself strangely attracted to him. Buddy wows the crowd with his jazzy, breezy musical delivery and poised demeanor at the Purple Pit, a nightclub where the students hang out. He also mocks a bartender and waitress and punches a student. The formula wears off at inopportune times, often to Kelp's humiliation.\\nAlthough Kelp knows that his alternate persona is a bad person, he cannot prevent himself from continually taking the formula as he enjoys the attention that Love receives. As Buddy performs at the annual student dance the formula starts to wear off. His real identity now revealed, Kelp gives an impassioned speech, admitting his mistakes and seeking forgiveness. Kelp says that the one thing he learned from being someone else is that if you don't like yourself, you can't expect others to like you.

Bono labelled it \\"a more meditative album on the theme of pilgrimage\\". Provisionally titled Songs of Ascent, it would be a sister release to No Line on the Horizon, similar to Zooropa's relationship to Achtung Baby. In June 2009, Bono said that although nine tracks had been completed, the album would only be released if its quality surpassed that of No Line on the Horizon. A December 2009 report stated that U2 had been working in the studio with the goal of a mid-2010 release. The band revealed that the first single was intended to be \\"Every Breaking Wave\\".Over time, the album continued to be delayed. In April 2010, U2's manager Paul McGuinness confirmed that the album would not be finished by June, but indicated that a release \\"before the end of the year [was] increasingly likely.\\" In October 2010, Bono stated that their new album would be produced by Danger Mouse, and that 12 songs had been completed.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk.

In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.","target":"Tim","rationale":"When comparing the two fires, Bill’s fire will burn slower than Tim’s.

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\\n\\n- Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a Gram - positive , non-motile bacterium that plays an important role in the creation of Emmental cheese , and to some extent , Jarlsberg cheese , Leerdammer and Maasdam cheese . Its concentration in Swiss - type cheeses is higher than in any other cheese . Propionibacteria are commonly found in milk and dairy products , though they have also been extracted from soil . P. freudenreichii has a circular chromosome about 2.5 Mb long . When Emmental cheese is being produced , P. freudenreichii ferments lactate to form acetate , propionate , and carbon dioxide ( 3 C3H6O3  2 C2H5CO2 + C2H3O2 + CO2 ) . The products of this fermentation contribute to the nutty and sweet flavors of the cheese , and the carbon dioxide byproduct is responsible for forming the holes , or \`\` eyes '' in the cheese . Cheesemakers control the size of the holes by changing the acidity , temperature , and curing time of the mixture . An estimated one billion living cells of P. freudenreichii are present in one gram of Emmental . In contrast to most lactic acid bacteria , this bacterium mainly breaks down lipids , forming free fatty acids . Recent research has focused on possible benefits incurred from consuming P. freudenreichii , which are thought to cleanse the gastrointestinal tract . P. freudenreichii has also been suggested to possibly lower the incidence of colon cancer . This mutualistic relationship is unusual in propionibacteria , which are largely commensal .

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.\\n\\n- Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth. This naturally occurring chemical compound is made up of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, in ice caps and glaciers and also in seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas.\\n\\n- Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.\\n\\n- In chemistry, a carbonate is a salt of carbonic acid (HCO), characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion, . The name may also mean an ester of carbonic acid, an organic compound containing the carbonate group C(=O)(O).\\n\\n- Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.\\n\\n- In chemistry, esters are chemical compounds derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an Oalkyl (alkoxy) group. Usually, esters are derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Glycerides, which are fatty acid esters of glycerol, are important esters in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids, and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in essential oils and pheromones. Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules. Nitrate esters, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties, while polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties.\\n\\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- Lactose is a disaccharide sugar composed of galactose and glucose that is found in milk. Lactose makes up around 28% of milk (by weight), although the amount varies among species and individuals, and milk with a reduced amount of lactose also exists. It is extracted from sweet or sour whey. The name comes from ' (gen. '), the Latin word for milk, plus the \\"-ose\\" ending used to name sugars. It has a formula of CHO and the hydrate formula CHO·HO, making it an isomer of sucrose.\\n\\n- An acetate is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with an alkaline, earthy, or metallic base. \\"Acetate\\" also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula CHO. The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a \\"positive\\" ion (called a cation) are also commonly called \\"acetates\\" (hence, \\"acetate of lead\\", \\"acetate of aluminum\\", etc.). The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CHCO, or CHCOO.\\n\\n- A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.\\n\\n- Carbonate rocks are a class of sedimentary rocks composed primarily of carbonate minerals. The two major types are limestone, which is composed of calcite or aragonite (different crystal forms of CaCO) and dolostone, which is composed of the mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO)).\\n\\n- Colostrum (known colloquially as beestings, bisnings or first milk) is a form of milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals (including humans) in late pregnancy. Most species will generate colostrum just prior to calving. Colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease. In general, protein concentration in colostrum is substantially higher than in milk. Fat concentration is substantially higher in colostrum than in milk in some species, e.g. sheep and horses, but lower in colostrum than in milk in some other species, e.g. camels and humans. In swine, fat concentration of milk at 48 to 72 hours after parturition may be higher than in colostrum or in late-lactation milk. Fat concentration in bovine colostrum is extremely variable.\\n\\n- Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- Emmentaler or Emmental is a yellow, medium-hard Swiss cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, Canton Bern. It has a savoury, but mild taste. While the denomination \\"Emmentaler Switzerland\\" is protected, \\"Emmentaler\\" alone is not; similar cheeses of other origins, especially from France and Bavaria and even Finland, are widely available and sold by that name. Emmentaler dates to the time of ancient history.\\n\\n- Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\n\\n- Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.\\n\\n- Jarlsberg is a mild cow's-milk cheese with large regular holes, that originates from Jarlsberg, Norway. Although it originated in Norway, it is also produced in Ohio and Ireland under licenses from Norwegian dairy producers.\\n\\n- Maasdam cheese is a Swiss-style Dutch cheese. Made from cow's milk, it is aged for at least 4 weeks. It ripens faster than other Dutch cheeses. Maasdam has internal holes from the ripening process, and a smooth, yellow rind. Sometimes, it is waxed like Gouda. The cheese was created to compete with the popular Swiss Emmental by being less expensive and quicker to produce. In the process of making a cheese with the same general components as Swiss cheeses, the Dutch ended up with a cheese that is nutty and sweet, but softer than Emmental due to a higher moisture content.\\n\\n- Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.\\n\\n- Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.\\n\\n- A double bond in chemistry is a chemical bond between two chemical elements involving four bonding electrons instead of the usual two. The most common double bond, that is between two carbon atoms, can be found in alkenes. Many types of double bonds exist between two different elements. For example, in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. Other common double bonds are found in azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N) and sulfoxides (S=O).

She successfully \\"crossed over\\" to pop music and was one of the most influential, successful, and acclaimed vocalists of the 20th century. She died at age 30 in the crash of a private airplane. Cline was known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice, and her role as a country music pioneer.\\n\\nBill Peer, her second manager, gave her the name Patsy, from her middle name, Patterson. (Bill Peer, who had a country music band in Brunswick, MD, also had an infant daughter named Patsy). In 1955 he gained a contract for her at Four Star Records, the label he was then affiliated with. Four Star was under contract to the Coral subsidiary of Decca Records. Patsy signed with Decca at her first opportunity three years later.  Her first contract allowed her to record compositions only by Four Star writers, which Cline found limiting. Later, she expressed regret over signing with the label, but thinking that nobody else would have her, she took the deal. Her first record for Four Star was \\"A Church, A Courtroom & Then Good-Bye,\\" which attracted little attention, although it led to appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. As these performances were not \\"records\\" per se, they were not governed by her contract, and she could sing what she wanted, within reason. This somewhat eased her \\"stifled\\" feeling.  Between 1955 and 1957, Cline recorded honky tonk material, with songs like \\"Fingerprints,\\" \\"Pick Me Up On Your Way Down,\\" \\"Don't Ever Leave Me Again,\\" and \\"A Stranger In My Arms.\\" Cline co-wrote the last two. None of these songs gained notable success. She experimented with rockabilly.  According to Decca Records producer Owen Bradley, the Four Star compositions only hinted at Patsy's potential. Bradley thought that her voice was best-suited for pop music, but Cline sided with Peer and the other Four Star producers, insisting that she could only record country songs, as her contract also stated. Every time Bradley tried to get her to sing the torch songs that would become her signature, she would panic, missing her familiar country fiddle and steel guitar. She often rebelled, only wishing to sing country and yodel. She recorded 51 songs with Four Star.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.\\n\\n- BBC Worldwide Ltd. is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC, formed out of a restructuring of its predecessor BBC Enterprises in 1995.

Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.\\n\\n- Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada.
