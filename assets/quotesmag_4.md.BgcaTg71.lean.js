The population coalesced first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. A 1973 military coup saw a change of leadership, but pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died together when their plane was shot down in April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\\nRwanda's economy suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened.

He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the... contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person a reporter called \\"one of the best of commanders\\"?, what is it ?","target":"James Luce","rationale":"The answer is \\"James Luce\\".\\nThis question has a stand alone rationale."},{"source":"You are given a conversation between two people.

Eleven plays later, the Patriots faced 3rd-and-goal from the Jets' 2-yard line, but a run for a loss by running back Laurence Maroney set up a 21-yard Gostkowski field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. After a Jets punt, the Patriots extended their lead to 6-0 on a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal early in the second quarter. The Jets responded with a 77-yard drive, highlighted by a 54-yard Laveranues Coles completion from quarterback Brett Favre, which brought them as close to the end zone as the Patriots' 1-yard line, but they again had to settle for a field goal; this time Feely completed the 21-yard attempt to cut the Patriots' lead to 6-3.

Causes included gunshot wounds in 89 patients, stab wounds in 65, and blunt trauma in 11. Mortality rates were 18%, 5%, and 27%, respectively, deaths being caused primarily by bleeding from associated injuries. Operations on these patients included laparotomy in 123 (75%), thoracotomy in four (2%), and both in 38 (23%). The mortality rates for these operations were 0%, 50%, and 53%, respectively. A presumptive preoperative diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury from chest x-ray findings was possible in only 24 (15%) patients. Of 42 thoracotomies, five were performed in the emergency department for cardiac arrest, with three (60%) deaths. Of 37 thoracotomies performed in the operating room, 17 were for thoracic injuries with six (35%) deaths and 20 were for resuscitation for abdominal injuries with 13 (65%) deaths. In most patients, the diaphragmatic injury was critical only in warning the surgeon that severe injuries might be present in both the chest and abdomen. Of 43 patients admitted with a blood pressure of less than 70 mm Hg or four or more associated injuries, 22 died. However, even in these high-risk patients, if resuscitation raised the initial operating room blood pressure to more than 70 mm Hg, reduced the shock time to less than 30 minutes, and kept blood loss below 10 units, the mortality was only 8% (1/12). In contrast, if none of these conditions could be met, the mortality in this high-risk group was 100% (16/16). Thus more aggressive resuscitative efforts and earlier control of bleeding seem to provide the best chance for improved survival. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Acute injuries of the diaphragm.

Even though Turkish Cypriots made up only 18% of the population, the partition of Cyprus and creation of a Turkish state in the north became a policy of Turkish Cypriot leaders and Turkey in the 1950s. Turkish leaders for a period advocated the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey as Cyprus was considered an \\"extension of Anatolia\\" by them; while since the 19th century, the majority Greek Cypriot population and its Orthodox church had been pursuing union with Greece, which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s. Following nationalist violence in the 1950s, Cyprus was granted independence in 1960. In 1963, the 11-year intercommunal violence between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots started, which displaced more than 25,000 Turkish Cypriots and brought the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the republic. On 15 July 1974, a coup d'état was staged by Greek Cypriot nationalists and elements of the Greek military junta in an attempt at enosis, the incorporation of Cyprus into Greece. This action precipitated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which led to the capture of the present-day territory of Northern Cyprus the following month, after a ceasefire collapsed, and the displacement of over 150,000 Greek Cypriots and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots. A separate Turkish Cypriot state in the north was established in 1983.

This behavior was associated with the onset of hypothermia, with deep body temperature falling by up to about 3 degrees C, usually to a new, steady level. Both the length of time spent in the cooler environment and the degree of the hypothermia produced increased with the partial pressure of N2O or N2 used. The effects of N2O on behavioral thermoregulation and body temperature were reversible. There was a correlation between anesthetic potency and the ability of both gases to alter thermoregulation, suggesting that the effect of these agents on thermoregulation was caused by the same molecular interactions as those which underlie anesthesia. Since both gases elicited changes in behavioral thermoregulation promoting rather than opposing the onset of hypothermia, it is concluded that they may have acted to lower the level at which deep body temperature was being regulated.","target":"Effects of subanesthetic doses of inert gases on behavioral thermoregulation in mice","rationale":"The title should convey the key ideas of this paper, which is to investigate the effect of subanesthetic doses of inert gases on behavioral thermoregulation in mice.

I work as a software developer (kind of, see later), just graduated from university. Over summer last year, I worked for a small company (about 8 developers and 2 bosses/managers) doing a programming internship for three months, completely unpaid, even paying for my own transport costs. After graduating they offered me a temporary job for three months to do a short amount of work, with the possibility for extension, which I took. Importantly, my brother works there full time, which is how I got into the company. (would not recommended, not because I don't get on with *him*, as I do, but because it's hard not to worry any tension between me and other people (which I'm great at generating) won't somehow affect him)\\n\\nI have got on really well with everyone there, including the bosses, Mary and Mark. While Mary and Mark act as management and team leaders, they also do marketing, client relations, presentations etc. Basically everything the company needs that isn't programming.\\n\\nI really like everyone as people. But as coworkers, they're complete nightmares and do not get along at all. Two employee are always making snide remarks at each other under a very weak facade of \\"I'm just joking!\\" causing a lot of tension. Another employee is constantly late, delays meetings, argues with Mark and talks down to people he is supposed to be teaching. Circular arguments getting increasingly louder with immovable egos are incredibly common. Code is always written \\"my way\\" with no consistency. The bosses seem perfectly fine with all behaviour, with attempt to reprimand anyone. The way Mary handled my contract broke the law in minor ways at multiple points. Essentially, Mary and Mark seem pretty incompetent at management. It's worth mentioning the entire office is in one room so everyone can hear every conversation. Ultimately, we mutually didn't extend my contract because I did not want to work in that kind of environment. \\n\\nWhen I started I was given a pretty old laptop with a fairly damaged screen, but otherwise it did work fine. Ok, I thought, I'll just mainly use a monitor (everyone at the company has a laptop and one monitor, some people have two monitors). \\n\\nI asked Mary if there were any monitors I could use. She directed me to two old monitors, with a vga to vga cable, when my laptop only takes HDMI. I ask people if there are any vga to HDMI adapters, and they essentially say \\"there might be some around\\". The office is a complete mess with no organisation (of course), so I give up after a few minutes and buy one online. \\n\\nThe cable arrives, and the monitors don't work. I tell Mary \\"I don't think these monitors work with this laptop\\" and she agrees the monitors are kind of crappy. I take the cable home and test on my own computer, and they do work, and my work laptop does work with my brother's monitors, meaning the fault is with the old monitors. I tell Mary \\"these monitors don't work\\". I don't remember the response, but I suppose I assumed I had implied I would like a monitor.\\n\\nA week later, I mention to everyone during a team meeting, including Mary and Mark, that my monitors don't work. Nothing still happens so I think \\"fine, I'm just a temp. Maybe their budget doesn't extend that far\\" and left it, except sometimes jokingly mentioning to the others how nice it must be to have two monitors. I also mention in private to my brother how hard it is it work with no monitor, but I thought the issue was closed.\\n\\nIn their defence, I don't think I ever actually directly asked for them to buy me a new monitor, but it didn't really seem appropriate as a new employee and I wasn't really sure whether the employees bought and owned the monitors they used or if the company did (as it turned out, the company did), or what the standard procedure for well, anything was, bearing in mind this was my first professional job and I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I also didn't have any kind of \\"this is how things work here now\\" as I had gone from an intern to an employee, and it had been a year.\\n\\nI work for two months and the job I was supposed to be doing falls through and I get moved onto doing testing instead of programming, which is *not* what I agreed to, although it does say in my contract they can make me do whatever they think is appropriate. I do not like testing and am not good at it. The little bit of programming I'm expected to do is in a language I don't like and is back-end, when the original work was basically the exact opposite of these two things. I'm unable to do it and my brother has to take it from me, making me feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed. I do nothing and learn nothing for two months, making me already incredibly bitter and feel like I'm utterly wasting my time.\\n\\nDuring this time there were a few other things that made me feel undervalued and completely unwanted there. Not unwanted personally, but professionally. However, I know I can be a little paranoid, so I ignore it I put down the way I've been treated to incompetence rather than intent. It'll be over soon anyway.\\n\\nTwo months are past and I have two weeks left. A new guy, Bob, starts working there temporarily for a few months just like me, same age as me too, although he's there to help with the management side of things rather than \\"programming\\". Mark is away on business and has been for a week or so, so Mary invites Bob to sit at Mark's desk and use his monitors until he gets back. I'm a little annoyed I hadn't been asked to sit there while Mark was away but whatever, I hadn't thought of it either.\\n\\nA few days after Bob starts, Mary walks in carrying a brand new monitor in a box. Somehow, I already know what she's going to say. \\n\\n\\"Bob's new monitor has arrived!\\"\\n\\nApparently there wasn't a budget, there was just complete apathy. I'm absolutely livid. The angriest I have probably been in years. I want to fucking scream at someone, though I'm not sure what or who at. \\"But *I* wanted a monitor!\\" probably wouldn't achieve much. It's ridiculous over a fucking *monitor*, but I'm shaking with anger. It's embarrassing. Fortunately, I sit in the corner (worst spot in the office, obviously) and have my headphones in so I sit there for a bit until the conversation dies down and everyone is at their desk. I then go outside and calm down until I stop shaking. I sit back down and try to pretend everything is ok, which really, it should be, but my voice is still shaky and I'm so angry  I can't concentrate on my work for the rest of the day.\\n\\nNow, as Bob is brand new and was already using a monitor, I doubt he asked for a monitor, Mary would have bought him one.\\n\\nSomehow the conversation gets back onto monitors and I say something like \\"As Bob has a new monitor, could I have a monitor please?\\"\\n\\nMy brother responds with \\"oh, did you actually want a monitor?\\". \\n\\nAlthough it's not his responsibility to buy equipment for me, it's Mary's, this still pisses me off. I say as calmly as possible while still an irritated voice \\"*Of course* I want a monitor. I mentioned *multiple times* that the monitors you gave me don't work\\". \\n\\n\\"Oh, I didn't know that\\". Which is a blatant lie. I'm not sure how much clearer I could be than \\"these monitors don't work\\".\\n\\nMy brother gave me one of his monitors that works, but it's all a bit bittersweet. Mary still hasn't bought me a monitor.\\n\\n\\nJust to clarify, I'm not angry about Bob getting a monitor and me not, not really. I'm angry that Mary decided that Bob would get something she should have known I needed to be efficient. Someone that did not spend three months doing completely free work and someone that did not spend two weeks trying to politely prompt her. How else am I meant to feel but unwanted in that workplace?\\n\\nI'm angry at the complete apathy I feel is directed towards me, for no apparent reason. I'm angry that I'm treated like an intern not an employee. The monitor was just the final straw. If I wasn't leaving already, I would think about quitting asap.\\n\\nSo I don't think I'm an asshole for being annoyed about the monitor thing, but am I the asshole for being being entitled? Am I the asshole for being as angry as I am over something trivial? Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to communicate and then getting angry?","target":"answerable","rationale":"The author feels that they have been treated unfairly by the boss (Mary), who has shown favoritism to another employee (Bob) and has neglected their needs.

After being incorporated into the Sui dynasty, its economic richness was used for the Sui dynasty's ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into Korea and Vietnam. The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay), and from Suzhou, and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's Jiangnan East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous.

During Prohibition, which was enacted nationally in 1919 and lasted until 1933, much liquor was consumed and gambling regularly took place in the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants. It was during Prohibition that racketeer and political boss Enoch L. \\"Nucky\\" Johnson rose to power. Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City, and, because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments, the resort's popularity grew further. The city then dubbed itself as \\"The World's Playground\\". Nucky Johnson's income, which reached as much as $500,000 annually, came from the kickbacks he took on illegal liquor, gambling and prostitution operating in the city, as well as from kickbacks on construction projects.\\n\\nWhat years do many historians consider Atlantic City's golden age?","target":"1920s","rationale":"In the passage, it is stated that \\"the 1920s... are considered by many historians as Atlantic City's golden age\\".

Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry.\\n\\nGaelic Ireland was involved in trade with Britain and mainland Europe from ancient times, and this trade increased over the centuries. Tacitus, for example, wrote in the 1st century that most of Ireland's harbours were known to the Romans through commerce. There are many passages in early Irish literature that mention luxury items imported from foreign lands, and the fair of Carman in Leinster included a market of foreign traders. In the Middle Ages the main exports were textiles such as wool and linen while the main imports were luxury items.  Money was seldom used in Gaelic society; instead, goods and services were usually exchanged for other goods and services. The economy was mainly a pastoral one, based on livestock (cows, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.) and their products. Cattle was \\"the main element in the Irish pastoral economy\\" and the main form of wealth, providing milk, butter, cheese, meat, fat, hides, and so forth. They were a \\"highly mobile form of wealth and economic resource which could be quickly and easily moved to a safer locality in time of war or trouble\\". The nobility owned great herds of cattle that had herdsmen and guards. Sheep, goats and pigs were also a valuable resource but had a lesser role in Irish pastoralism.  Horticulture was practised; the main crops being oats, wheat and barley, although flax was also grown for making linen.  Transhumance was also practised, whereby people moved with their livestock to higher pastures in summer and back to lower pastures in the cooler months. The summer pasture was called the buaile (anglicized as booley) and it is noteworthy that the Irish word for boy (buachaill) originally meant a herdsman.

One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\\",\\n\\nanswer the following question.

After a while he looks over and notices water has begun to group under the bend in the straw even though the bend is above the surface of the water.\\n\\nand a hint : Another important physical property of water, is adhesion . In terms of water, adhesion is the bonding of a water molecule to another substance, such as the sides of a leaf's veins. This process happens because hydrogen bonds are special in that they break and reform with great frequency. This constant rearranging of hydrogen bonds allows a percentage of all the molecules in a given sample to bond to another substance. This grip-like characteristic that water molecules form causes capillary action , the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in a narrow space. An example of capillary action is when you place a straw into a glass of water. The water seems to climb up the straw before you even place your mouth on the straw. The water has created hydrogen bonds with the surface of the straw, causing the water to adhere to the sides of the straw. As the hydrogen bonds keep interchanging with the straw's surface, the water molecules interchange positions and some begin to ascend the straw.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Will the amount of water gathered at this bend increase or decrease given enough time?","target":"increase","rationale":"It is important to note that the straw provides an example of capillary action.

Anorthosite Fest. Through a Global Forum initiative at Brown University, Professor Lew Ashwal from Witwatersrand University in South Africa visited the Department of Geological Sciences from July 16 to 27th. The overall goal of the Forum was to initiate long-term research links with prominent universities around the globe. Lew is a world expert on terrestrial anorthosite formation and his visit sparked broad interest and support across Brown/MIT NLSI for discussions on the formation of lunar anorthosite. During Lew’s visit, the current knowledge of the origin of both terrestrial and lunar anorthosites was reviewed and interdisciplinary research directions discussed. Anorthosite and labradorescence. Anorthosite is an igneous monomineralic rock that is composed of plagioclase feldspar (over 90% of the rock is composed of this mineral). Plagioclase is a very common mineral group, more than half of the Earth’s crust is composed of it. Anorthosite in many cases is not light-colored at all. This is the result of tiny Fe-Ti oxide inclusions in plagioclase crystals that give them bluish-black hue. One fascinating aspect associated with many anorthosites is an effect called labradorescence. It is a special form of iridescence. of the western body of gabbroic anorthosite (Rose, 1960). The anorthosite probably originally formed by plagioclase floatation in mafic magma chamber at the base of the crust (Ashwal, 1993). The ores for med late during the crystallization of anorthosite by concentration of Fe-Ti oxides (Ashwal, 1993). metamorphism: (1) precipitation of metamorphic zircon from solid state reactions involving breakdown of Zr-bearing phases or (2) precipitation of partial intergranular melt, enriched in zirconium by partial reabsorbion of Lew Ashwal greeting an old friend. Credit: Brown/MIT. Lew’s visit began with two extended lectures by him on terrestrial anorthosites, followed by a three-day field trip to anorthosite regions in the Adirondacks. A few people raised questions about how the new-found H2O in the lunar mantle would change our models of anorthosite formation. Also, the issue of how the very pure anorthosite (with scarce mafic minerals) widely observed across the Moon is formed was also discussed. In comparing the lunar anorthosites to terrestrial examples, it was unclear whether they were analogous to Archean anorthosites, which have similarly high An contents, but are thought to be derived from hydrous magmas. metamorphic zircon for mation in samples studied by Bingen et al. (2000), were not found in the thin sections (see also Davidson and v an Breemen, 1988). In the Ivry deposit, silica activity was high enough along the plagioclase boundaries to form zircon during cooling or metamorphism rather than baddeleyite or srilankite. Metamorphic Zircon in Fe-Ti Ores, Morin Anorthosite Complex (Grenville Province, Quebec) Anorthosite is a plutonic rock just as granite and gabbro and it is usually associated with the latter. Therefore we can conclude that despite being officially leucocratic it actually is usually associated with mafic rocks.

Through his father he was the grandson of the god Hephaestus. He married a naiad, Zeuxippe, and they had two sons Erechtheus and Butes, and two daughters Procne and Philomela.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Nisos was the King of Megara, and one of the four sons of Pandion II, King of Athens. \\n\\n- Cecrops II was the legendary or semi-legendary son of Pandion I and inherited the Athenian throne from his brother Erechtheus.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Pandion II was a legendary King of Athens, the son and heir of Cecrops II and his wife Metiadusa, and the father of Aegeus, Pallas, Nisos and Lycus.\\n\\n- A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists.\\n\\n- Theseus was the mythical king of Athens and was the son of Aethra by two fathers: Aegeus and Poseidon.\\n\\n- Cecrops (\\"Kékrops\\"; \\"gen\\".: ) was a mythical king of Athens who, according to Eusebius reigned for fifty years. The name is not of Greek origin according to Strabo, or it might mean 'face with a tail': it is said that, born from the earth itself, he had his top half shaped like a man and the bottom half in serpent or fish-tail form. He was the founder and the first king of Athens itself, though preceded in the region by the earth-born king Actaeus of Attica. Cecrops was a culture hero, teaching the Athenians marriage, reading and writing, and ceremonial burial.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology , Pallas ( Ancient Greek :  ) was one of the four sons of Pandion II and Pylia . Upon the death of Pandion , Pallas and his brothers ( Aegeas , Nisos , and Lykos ) took control of Athens from Metion , who had seized the throne from Pandion . They divided the government in four but Aegeas became king . Pallas received Paralia or Diacria as his domain , or else he shared the power over several demes with Aegeus . Later , after the death of Aegeas , Pallas tried to take the throne from the rightful heir , his nephew , Theseus , but failed and was killed by him , and so were his fifty children , the Pallantides . In a version endorsed by Servius , Pallas was not a brother , but a son of Aegeus , and thus a brother of Theseus , by whom he was expelled from Attica . He then came to Arcadia , where he became king and founded a dynasty to which Evander and another Pallas belonged .\\n\\n- Erechtheus in Greek mythology was the name of an archaic king of Athens, the founder of the \\"polis\\" and, in his role as god, attached to Poseidon, as \\"Poseidon Erechtheus\\". The mythic Erechtheus and an historical Erechtheus were fused into one character in Euripides' lost tragedy \\"Erechtheus\\" (423/22 BCE). The name Erichthonius is carried by a son of Erechtheus, but Plutarch conflated the two names in the myth of the begetting of Erechtheus.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Metion (\\"gen\\". ) was a son of King Erechtheus of Athens or of Eupalamus, son of King Erechtheus. His sons later drove King Pandion II out of Athens into exile. Among these sons were Eupalamus, Sicyon, and Daedalus, though they are sometime credited with other parentages. These usurping sons were in turn overthrown by the sons of Pandion.\\n\\n- Jean Racine, baptismal name Jean-Baptiste Racine (22 December 163921 April 1699), was a French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France (along with Molière and Corneille), and an important literary figure in the Western tradition. Racine was primarily a tragedian, producing such \\"examples of neoclassical perfection\\" as \\"Phèdre\\", \\"Andromaque\\", and \\"Athalie\\", although he did write one comedy, \\"Les Plaideurs\\", and a muted tragedy, \\"Esther\\", for the young.\\n\\n- Poseidon (Greek: ) was one of the twelve Olympian deities of the pantheon in Greek mythology. His main domain was the ocean, and he is called the \\"God of the Sea\\". Additionally, he is referred to as \\"Earth-Shaker\\" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the \\"tamer of horses\\". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and a beard.\\n\\n- Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Aegeus or Aegeas, was an archaic figure in the founding myth of Athens. The \\"goat-man\\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens.\\n\\n- Megara is a historic town and a municipality in West Attica, Greece. It lies in the northern section of the Isthmus of Corinth opposite the island of Salamis, which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by Athens. Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythic sons of King Pandion II, of whom Nisos was the ruler of Megara. Megara was also a trade port, its people using their ships and wealth as a way to gain leverage on armies of neighboring poleis. Megara specialized in the exportation of wool and other animal products including livestock such as horses. It possessed two harbors, Pegae, to the west on the Corinthian Gulf and Nisaea, to the east on the Saronic Gulf of the Aegean Sea.\\n\\n- Main injector neutrino oscillation search (MINOS) is a particle physics experiment designed to study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations, first discovered by a Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) experiment in 1998. Neutrinos produced by the NuMI (\\"Neutrinos at Main Injector\\") beamline at Fermilab near Chicago are observed at two detectors, one very close to where the beam is produced (the \\"near detector\\"), and another much larger detector 735 km away in northern Minnesota (the \\"far detector\\").\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, the Pallantidai were the fifty sons of Pallas, nobles of Attica, and rivals of their uncle Aegeus and his son Theseus over the Athenian throne. Diodorus Siculus related that they once became friends with Androgeos, a son of Minos, and that was why Aegeus had Androgeos assassinated, fearing that Pallas and his sons could use this friendship to get assistance from the powerful Minos against him. The Pallantidae and their father marched against Theseus and Aegeus because they hoped to gain control over Athens. According to Plutarch, one half of them under command of Pallas openly marched from Sphettus, while the other half laid an ambush near Gargettus. Their plan failed though, because Leos, their herald, warned Theseus of their schemes and an ambush they had prepared for him. Theseus pre-emptively ambushed the Pallantides and killed all those at Gargettus, whereupon the other half retreated. Other sources state that Theseus killed all the fifty Pallantidae as well as Pallas. A tradition saying that he spared their sister, Aricia, whom he kept as slave, is followed in Jean Racine's \\"Phèdre\\" but is not supported by extant genuinely ancient sources.\\n\\n- Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.\\n\\n- Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.\\n\\n- Diodorus Siculus (\\"Diodoros Sikeliotes\\") ( 1st century BC) or Diodorus of Sicily was a Greek historian. He is known for writing the monumental universal history \\"Bibliotheca historica\\", much of which survives, between 60 and 30 BC. It is arranged in three parts. The first covers mythic history up to the destruction of Troy, arranged geographically, describing regions around the world from Egypt, India and Arabia to Greece and Europe. The second covers the Trojan War to the death of Alexander the Great. The third covers the period to about 60 BC. \\"Bibliotheca\\", meaning 'library', acknowledges that he was drawing on the work of many other authors.\\n\\n- In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence.

Passage:In 1996, Toyota Motor Sports funded the development of an experimental Le Mans Prototype, which was officially known as the TOM'S Toyota LMP. As Toyota were primarily focusing on their Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) engine, which first ran that year, the LMP project was run on a tight budget of approximately $500,000. Due to this tight budget, the car, christened the \\"Lumpy\\", reused Toyota's 3S-GT engine in the 88C Group C specification, which was a 2.1-litre turbocharged straight-four engine, producing ; this engine was coupled to an Xtrac gearbox from a Peugeot Group C car. The chassis tub was designed to be simple but strong, and the bodywork was also simple; the tight budget meant that the LMP never saw a wind tunnel. The bodywork was designed to minimize lift over the upper body of the car, and had much simpler brake cooling than on most Le Mans Prototypes; the radiator ducts were used, via a scoop, to cool the brakes. After the LMP was completed, Tom Kristensen tested it on at least one occasion, whilst project director Andy Thorby recalled it being tested a total of three times; he stated that the car was very reliable, had lower fuel consumption than the 88C Group C car had (with the same engine), and that it also appeared to be quick. Following the completion of the tests, the car was dispatched to Toyota Team Europe's Cologne workshop, stored under a tarpaulin and eventually destroyed. Toyota would return to sportscar racing in 1998, with the André de Cortanze-designed Toyota GT-One.","target":"b","rationale":"The question only asks for the year that Toyota first used the engine in \\"Lumpy\\". This information can be found directly in the passage: \\"the LMP project was run on a tight budget of approximately $500,000.

The Steelers would score first on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to tight end Heath Miller, but the Raiders would respond when running back Darren McFadden would break loose on a run and take it 64-yards for a touchdown.  Heath Miller would catch another 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Raiders would once again respond with a 3-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer to Darrius Heyward-Bey.  The Steelers would kick a 33-yard field goal as time expired in the first half to give them a 17-14 lead.  The Steelers would begin the second half by driving down the field and scoring on a 22-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace.  But the Raiders would yet again respond with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Richard Gordon.  The Steelers would again drive down the field easily, but Antonio Brown would fumble the football in the endzone.  After review, it was determined that Brown had recovered his own fumble and the Steelers found themselves leading the game 31-21 with 1:31 left in the third quarter.  Early in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh safety Ryan Mundy, playing for the injured Troy Polamalu, committed a helmet-to-helmet hit on Oakland receiver Heyward-Bey.  The hit knocked Heyward-Bey unconscious and he was taken to the hospital with a concussion and sprained neck.  (Mundy was not flagged for the illegal hit by the replacement referees, but would be fined by the NFL a few days later.)  The Steelers secondary issues from the past few years continued, as they could not stop Carson Palmer and the Raiders passing attack.  The Raiders would score on a 6-yard touchdown pass and a 32-yard field goal to tie the game at 31.  The Steelers had a chance to win the game late in the fourth quarter, but the Raiders defense held them to a 3-and-out and forced them to punt the ball back.  Palmer would again exploit Pittsburgh's suspect secondary and kicker Janikowski would kick a 43-yard field goal as time expired to give the Raiders a 34-31 victory over the Steelers, their first of the season.

After coming back from a mission she sees through the glamour of the shape shifter who is impersonating her mother figure character, Raquel. Turns out the shape shifter is named Lend. He's male. He's hot. He is the love interest. Unfortunately you also have Reth (Lorethen) who is the evil/beautiful/scary Fairy who is basically trying to stalk her.  I might add right here that I much prefer fairies over vampires and find it so sad that they are used more in literature. Oh, and if your teen loves vampires - they LOOK like nasty rotting corpses to Evie. You might want to warn the teen in question.Anyhow this is the first book in a series so of course we don't get real closure. The whole idea of being able to see through glamour is not unique - it's in all the older fairy tales I'm glad to see it's making its way back into literature. The way the idea is portrayed though makes it make sense. I won't ruin the story by giving out spoilers to the rest just know that someone is killing paranormals as well as killing a large group of the International Paranormal Containment Agency (Evie's group).At the same time though I admit that some of the story felt very Mary Sue-ish. Finding Evie forces the whole Agency to become an international one as EVERYONE wants access to Evie. So in that - the book fails.

Released on October 10, 1966, the single was an immediate critical and commercial hit, topping record charts in several countries including the US and UK. Characterized by its complex soundscapes, episodic structure, and subversions of pop music formula, it was the costliest single ever recorded at the time of its release. \\"Good Vibrations\\" later became widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music.\\n\\nAlthough the song does not technically contain a theremin, \\"Good Vibrations\\" is the most frequently cited example of the instrument's use in pop music. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins and increased the awareness of analog synthesizers. The notion that \\"Good Vibrations\\" features a theremin has been erroneously repeated in books, CD liner notes, and quotes from the recording's participants. While having a similar sound, a theremin is an aerial-controlled instrument, unlike the Electro-Theremin.  When the Beach Boys needed to reproduce its sound onstage, Wilson first requested that Tanner play the Electro-Theremin live with the group, but he declined due to commitments. Tanner recalls saying to Wilson, \\"I've got the wrong sort of hair to be on stage with you fellas\\", to which Wilson replied: \\"We'll give you a Prince Valiant wig.\\" The Beach Boys then requested the services of Walter Sear, who asked Bob Moog to design a ribbon controller, since the group was used to playing the fretboards of a guitar. Sears remembers marking fretboard-like lines on the ribbon \\"so they could play the damn thing.\\" Moog began manufacturing his own models of theremins. He later noted: \\"The pop record scene cleaned us out of our stock which we expected to last through Christmas.\\"  In Steven M. Martin's 1993 documentary Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey, in which Wilson makes an appearance, it was revealed that the attention being paid to the theremin due to \\"Good Vibrations\\" caused Russian authorities to exile its inventor, Leon Theremin.\\n\\ndid any other bands use the theremin?","target":"the Beach Boys","rationale":"\\"Good Vibrations\\" is the most frequently cited example of a theremin in pop music.\\nAlthough other bands did not use the theremin, \\"the Beach Boys needed to reproduce its sound onstage\\".

One Health recognizes that human, domestic animal, and wildlife health are interconnected within ecosystem health and provides a framework for the development of multidisciplinary solutions to global health challenges. To date, most health-promoting interventions have focused largely on single-sector outcomes. For example, risk for transmission of zoonotic pathogens from bush-meat hunting is primarily focused on human hygiene and personal protection. However, bush-meat hunting is a complex issue promoting the need for holistic strategies to reduce transmission of zoonotic disease while addressing food security and wildlife conservation issues. Temporal and spatial separation of humans and wildlife, risk communication, and other preventative strategies should allow wildlife and humans to co-exist. Upstream surveillance, vaccination, and other tools to prevent pathogen spillover are also needed. Clear multi-sector outcomes should be defined, and a systems-based approach is needed to develop interventions that reduce risks and balance the needs of humans, wildlife, and the environment.

Tcf1(-/-) mice have previously been characterized and show developmental blocks at the CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) to CD4+CD8+ double positive transition. Due to the blocks in T-cell development, Tcf1(-/-) mice normally have a very small thymus. Unexpectedly, a large proportion of Tcf1(-/-) mice spontaneously develop thymic lymphomas with 50% of mice developing a thymic lymphoma/leukemia at the age of 16 wk. These lymphomas are clonal, highly metastatic, and paradoxically show high Wnt signaling when crossed with Wnt reporter mice and have high expression of Wnt target genes Lef1 and Axin2. In wild-type thymocytes, Tcf1 is higher expressed than Lef1, with a predominance of Wnt inhibitory isoforms. Loss of Tcf1 as repressor of Lef1 leads to high Wnt activity and is the initiating event in lymphoma development, which is exacerbated by activating Notch1 mutations. Thus, Notch1 and loss of Tcf1 functionally act as collaborating oncogenic events. Tcf1 deficiency predisposes to the development of thymic lymphomas by ectopic up-regulation of Lef1 due to lack of Tcf1 repressive isoforms and frequently by cooperating activating mutations in Notch1. Tcf1 therefore functions as a T-cell-specific tumor suppressor gene, besides its established role as a Wnt responsive transcription factor. Thus, Tcf1 acts as a molecular switch between proliferative and repressive signals during T-lymphocyte development in the thymus.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract describes the function of the protein Tcf1 and its role in T-cell development.

Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.\\nIn 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

A several-hour gunfight followed, but the rebels fled after a large group of police reinforcements arrived.\\n\\n- Social movements are a type of group action.

It began as a tendency within Daniel O'Connell's Repeal Association, associated with \\"The Nation\\" newspaper, but eventually split to found the Irish Confederation in 1847. Young Ireland led changes in Irish nationalism, including an abortive rebellion known as the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. Many of the rebellion's leaders were tried for sedition and sentenced to penal transportation to Van Diemen's Land. From its beginnings in the late 1830s, Young Ireland grew in influence and inspired following generations of Irish nationalists. Some of the junior members of the movement went on to found the Irish Republican Brotherhood.\\n\\n- The Irish Confederation was an Irish nationalist independence movement, established on 13 January 1847 by members of the Young Ireland movement who had seceded from Daniel O'Connell's Repeal Association.

Its counterpart in the United States of America was organised by John O'Mahony and became known as the Fenian Brotherhood (later Clan na Gael). The members of both wings of the movement are often referred to as \\"Fenians\\".

More rarely it describes the highest male solo voice type (usually designated countertenor), and it is also the root word of contralto, the lowest standard female voice type. When designating instruments, \\"alto\\" likewise can refer either to the corresponding vocal range (alto flute and alto trombone) or to musical role (alto recorder and alto clarinet).\\n\\n- The alto clarinet is a woodwind instrument of the clarinet family. It is a transposing instrument pitched in the key of E, though instruments in F (and in the 19th century, E) have been made. In Europe it is sometimes called a tenor clarinet. In size it lies between the soprano clarinet and the bass clarinet, to which it bears a greater resemblance in that it typically has a straight body (made of Grenadilla or other wood, hard rubber, or plastic), but a curved neck and bell made of metal. All-metal alto clarinets also exist. In appearance it strongly resembles the basset horn, but usually differs in three respects: it is pitched a tone lower, it lacks an extended lower range, and it has a wider bore than many basset horns.\\n\\n- A countertenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types. The countertenor range is generally equivalent to a contralto range, extending from around G to D or E, although a sopranist (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the soprano's range of around C to C. Countertenors often are baritones or tenors at core, but rarely use this vocal range in performance. The countertenor voice type has a lower tessitura than the contralto or mezzo-soprano.\\n\\n- Philip Paul Bliss (9 July 1838  29 December 1876) was an American composer, conductor, writer of hymns and a bass-baritone Gospel singer. He wrote many well-known hymns, including \\"Almost Persuaded\\"; \\"Hallelujah, What a Saviour!\\"; \\"Let the Lower Lights Be Burning\\"; \\"Wonderful Words of Life\\" and the tune for Horatio Spafford's \\"It Is Well with My Soul\\".\\n\\n- Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F).\\nThe tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor.\\n\\n- Gospel music is a music genre in Christian music. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. Gospel music usually has dominant vocals (often with strong use of harmony) with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century, with roots in the black oral tradition. Hymns and sacred songs were repeated in a call and response fashion. Most of the churches relied on hand clapping and foot stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done a cappella. The first published use of the term \\"Gospel Song\\" probably appeared in 1874. The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. Gospel music publishing houses emerged. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music. Following World War II, gospel music moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate.\\n\\n- A contralto is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type.\\nThe contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F), although at the extremes some voices can reach the E below middle C (E) or the second B above middle C (B). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.\\n\\n- The alto flute is a type of Western concert flute, a musical instrument in the woodwind family. It is the next extension downward of the C flute after the flûte d'amour. It is characterized by its distinct, mellow tone in the lower portion of its range. It is a transposing instrument in G and, like the piccolo and bass flute, uses the same fingerings as the C flute.\\n\\n- Lynda Tait Randle , alto singer of southern gospel music , was born in 1962 and grew up in the inner city of Washington , DC.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'lynda randle' has the relation 'voice type' with?","target":"contralto","rationale":"Lynda Tait Randle is a contralto, the lowest standard female singing voice."},{"source":"Given a math problem with context and a question and 5 answer choices, the task is to provide the correct answer choice based on the problem.

The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers.

It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm!\\nThe crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it.

As Judge Lansing pointed out in Gillihan I, the first is that: The opening words of subsection (1) make it clear that it does not apply in cases that are subject to subsection (4), and the opening words of subsection (4) establish that it governs “[i]n actions for personal injury, where the amount of plaintiffs claim for damages does not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,-000).” Gillihan I at 696, 99 P.3d at 1086. The two subsections do not govern together in personal injury actions, and to read them as though they do, as Gonzalez points out, is to edit the statutory language of I.C. § 12-120.

He used the basket A fruits to make some candied fruits, but was too lazy to use the basket B fruits. He just kept the basket B fruits on his kitchen top.\\n\\nand a hint : Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]\\n\\nThe continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which fruits will be saturated with sugar, basket A fruits or basket B fruits?","target":"basket A fruits","rationale":"The process of making candied fruit involves drenching the fruit in sugar syrup to preserve them.

In practice, emojis can either summarize and emphasis the original tune of their contexts, or express more complex semantics such as irony and sarcasm by being combined with contexts of contradictory semantics or sentiments.

The expected shootout between two potent offenses did not occur at the start of the game, as three New England turnovers on their first three drives of the game gave the Broncos a 17-0 lead in the 1st quarter. It was looking to be one of the most embarrassing performances in Patriot history as an additional touchdown gave Manning and the Broncos a 24-0 at the half. However, Brady and the Patriots were not going to let the Broncos run away with a blowout victory at Gillette. They regrouped in the locker room and came out to score 31 unanswered points, scoring on five straight drives out of the half, helped by three Denver turnovers of their own. The two halves were complete polar opposites, each displaying offensive domination on one side and defensive struggles on the other, flipping 180&#730; at the half. However, the Broncos managed to tie the game at 31 late in the 4th, eventually sending the game to overtime. The Patriots won the coin toss, but surprisingly elected to defend first, hoping to stop the Broncos from scoring and to take advantage of the wind for a potential game-winning field goal. This was exactly what happened, as the two teams traded punts twice, but on New England's second punt, Broncos cornerback Tony Carter ran into the punt, and Patriots' Nate Ebner recovered the ball on the Broncos' 20 yard line, setting up Gostkowski's game winning 31 yard field goal. The 24 point deficit was the largest comeback in Brady's and the Patriots' history, and gave Brady his 10th win in 14 meetings over Manning-led teams. Brady threw for 344 yard and 3 TD's in the contest, and WR Julian Edelman had a career day with 110 receiving yards for two scores. The win from down 24 points was the largest comeback win in Patriots history, surpassing 1984's comeback from down 23-0 against the Seahawks.

POST : I (26F) had shoulder surgery in December and have finally gotten the ok from my surgeon to resume normal activity. For the past three months I have not been allowed to run, use stationary bikes, ellipticals or lift more than 2-5 lbs. The recovery has been incredibly painful-- possibly the most painful thing I've ever had to work through. The whole thing has massively lowered my self-esteem. I used to be fit and happy with my body. Now, I'm several lbs heavier and just really frustrated with not being able to workout.\\n\\nIt's coming up on the one year mark since I injured my arm and all I want is to feel like I have some control over my body again. I decided that I wanted to try personal training so I can have someone there to check my form and help me find creative ways to push myself around my limitations. I feel like getting someone qualified to guide me is the safest way to get back in shape without compromising my shoulder's recovery.\\n\\nMy friend, Julie, goes to a gym she LOVES that is really close to my house. She's been going there for over a year. After texting her a question about the gym rates, she called to tell me she didn't think it'd be a good fit for me. She started out by telling me it was SUPER expensive and that it’s got limited equipment (it has great equipment), but eventually she just came out and said \\"I don't want to be a bitch, but I just don't want to see you there.\\" It’s a small facility and she feels like she's finally comfortable working out. She's struggled to be active her whole life and to find a place that really worked for her and this was it. It's clearly become her fitness safe space--and I get that. But then she got super condescending and wouldn't listen to me when I told her I didn't want to workout together, I just noticed their trainers had great accreditations. I tried to explain how hard  the past few months with my shoulder have been and that I really needed to find a trainer who knew what they were doing. She pretty much just ignored me and told me to try LA Fitness or anywhere else.\\n\\nIts been a week and I finally had time to go through and contact 16 different gyms in my area. Julie's gym is tied for the cheapest prices with one other facility. (Depending on the number of sessions I purchased, hers would be the cheaper of the two by $5/session). I texted her to let her know this -- including the names of all the facilities I contacted to show I made an effort (I also made a list of all the prices), but I haven't set up meetings to go talk to trainers at either gym yet (I intend to speak to both). She has yet to text me back and I have a feeling that she's pissed. I kind of wish that there were more options available, but I'm also a broke student and unfortunately her gym actually is really fairly priced with supposedly excellent coaches.\\n\\nAITA if I decide to set up personal training sessions at her gym after she told me she wasn't okay with it?","target":"no","rationale":"The author is looking to find a personal trainer in order to help them safely get back into working out after having shoulder surgery.

The Patriots opened the game with a 3-and-out, but on the ensuing punt, Denver returner Isaiah McKenzie muffed the return, and it was recovered by the Patriots. Brady capitalized quickly, as two quick completions to Rex Burkhead gave the Pats the lead at 12:43 in the first quarter, a lead they would not relinquish. The Broncos answered with a field goal, and on the ensuing kickoff, Pats special teams came through again with a Dion Lewis kick return for a touchdown. The Broncos added a second field goal in the first quarter, while the Patriots responded with one of their own at the start of the second quarter. The Broncos next drive stalled out short of midfield, and Burkhead found a hole in the line to block the Riley Dixon punt, once again giving the Patriots good field position. The Patriots and Broncos traded field goals, and the Patriots closed out the first half with a Brady-to-Dwayne Allen touchdown, his first reception of the season. The Broncos only sustained touchdown drive came at the start of the second half, ending in a Brock Osweiler-to-Demaryius Thomas seven-yard pass. Two more touchdowns by the Patriots (a run by Lewis and a reception by James White) would seal the deal, with Brady taking a rest at the end of the game to give new acquisition Brian Hoyer some game-time reps.

The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character.

It is most “important to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding.

His life, however, was not happy.\\nHe was born on July 15,1606 in Leiden, the Netherlands. His father wanted him to have a real, learned profession but Rembrandt left the University of Leiden after becoming bored. He began studying art under a local teacher but soon left and studied in Amsterdam where he mastered all his lessons in six months!\\nAt the age of 22, he moved back to Leiden and began to get his own students. One of his students was the famous artist Gerrit Dou. In 1631 he returned to Amsterdam where he became the most popular portrait painter in Holland. Rembrandt met Saskia and married her in 1634. She was a cousin of a very successful art dealer and she helped him to meet wealhy people who commissioned  many paintings from him. He used her as a model in many of his paintings.\\nRembrandt's private life, however, was very unfortunate. He had four children with Saskia but only one, Titus, survived. Saskia died in 1642 at the age of only 30. In 1649, his housekeeper became his second wife and was also a model for many of his paintings. Even though Rembrandt was very successful as an artist, art dealer and teacher, he lived in a careless way and had to declare bankruptcy  in 1656. He even had to sell his whole art collection and his house to pay off his debts.\\nHis unfortunate life, however, didn't affect his art. He painted many great paintings during that time. His new love, Hendrickje, died in 1663 and his 27-year-old son, Titus, died in 1668. Eleven months later, on October 4, 1669, Rembrandt died in Amsterdam.

These hypotheses were evaluated in a hospital-based case-control study. A total of 521 patients under age 45 with breast cancer were compared with 521 controls matched for age, time of interview, and geographic area. Oral contraceptive use before the first birth was reported by 155 patients and 137 controls. With allowance for confounding by multivariate analysis, the estimated relative risk was 1.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.5). The estimate was 1.0 (0.2-3.9) for any use among nulliparous women and 0.6 (0.3-1.3) for use before the first birth among parous women. Use before age 25 was reported by 145 patients and 141 controls, and the multivariate relative risk estimate was 1.0 (0.7-1.6); the results were similar when use of specific formulations was examined. For oral contraceptive use before either the first birth or age 25, the relative risk estimates were compatible with 1.0 for use of five or more years' duration or an interval since first use of at least 15 years. There was also no evidence of an increased risk in any subgroup including those at increased underlying risk because of factors such as a family history of breast cancer or a history of cystic breast disease. The findings suggest that, up to age 45, the risk of breast cancer is not influenced by the use of oral contraceptives before the first birth or before age 25 even if the use lasted for five or more years.","target":"Breast cancer risk in relation to early oral contraceptive use","rationale":"The abstract provides evidence that the risk of breast cancer is not influenced by the use of oral contraceptives before the first birth or before age 25 even if the use lasted for five or more years.

Seven patients with virilization and hyperandrogenism of various causes were evaluated with the use of sequential studies: testosterone stimulation and suppression tests; computerized tomography (CT); selective venous catheterization; and 131I-iodomethyl-norcholesterol (NP-59) scintigraphy. Comparison of the diagnostic accuracies of these localization studies with the ultimate diagnoses in this group of virilized women showed that: endocrinologic suppression/stimulation studies are of limited value in tumor localization and helpful only in patients with steroidogenic enzyme deficiencies; both selective catheterization and CT scanning may provide spurious localization data; and NP-59 scintigraphy, by depicting both the anatomic localization and functional androgen hypersecretion, may provide the most significant localization data in the evaluation of patients with virilizing syndromes. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data such as \\"131I-iodomethyl-norcholesterol (NP-59) scintigraphy\\", which is a type of imaging method.

Passage:The Royal Mint is a government-owned mint that produces coins for the United Kingdom. Operating under the name Royal Mint Ltd, the mint is a limited company that is wholly owned by Her Majesty's Treasury and is under an exclusive contract to supply all the nation's coinage. As well as minting circulating coins for use domestically and internationally, the mint also produces planchets, commemorative coins, various types of medals and precious metal bullion. The mint exports to an average of 60 countries a year, making up 70% of its total sales. Formed over 1,100 years ago, the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England, all of Great Britain and eventually most of the British Empire. The original London mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor was established in 886 AD and operated within the Tower of London for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court where it remained until the 1960s. As Britain followed the rest of the world in decimalising its currency, the Mint moved from London to a new plant in Llantrisant, Wales where it has remained since.","target":"a","rationale":"The question asks for the population of Llantrisant the year that the Original London mint was established, while the passage provides information about when and where the mint moved.

ADLTE is characterized by partial seizures with symptoms suggestive of a lateral temporal onset, including frequent auditory aura. Here we report the results of clinical and genetic analyses of two newly identified families with ADTLE.   \\n METHODS We identified two families whose seizure semiology was suggestive of ADLTE. Evaluation included a detailed history and neurologic examination, as well as collection of DNA. The coding sequence of the LGI1 gene from affected subjects from both families was analyzed for evidence of mutation.   \\n RESULTS Each patient had a history of partial seizures, often with secondary generalization earlier in the course. Auditory aura was reported by approximately two thirds of affected patients in each pedigree. Novel mutations in LGI1 were detected in both families. A heterozygous single-nucleotide deletion at position 329 (del 329C) was detected in affected individuals from one family, whereas patients from the second family had a nonsynonymous variation, corresponding to C435G.   \\n CONCLUSIONS We identified two novel mutations in the LGI1 gene. The phenotype of these two families was similar to that of other kindreds with ADLTE, as auditory aura was absent in one third of affected individuals. Our results further support that LGI1 mutations should be considered in patients with a history of partial seizures if the semiology of seizures is consistent with the onset in the lateral temporal lobe.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the purpose of the study (\\"PURPOSE Mutations in the leucine rich, glioma inactivated gene (LGI1) were recently described in a small number of families with autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE).

Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), maximal heart rate (HR max), maximal ventilation, and maximal oxygen pulse were obtained from a progressive ergocycle test to exhaustion. Total work output in a 90-min maximal ergocycle test was also determined in the twins. Fat-free weight was estimated from body density measurements obtained through underwater weighing. Aerobic performance scores were adjusted for age (brothers), and age and sex (dizygotic and monozygotic twins) by regression procedures. Dizygotic twins and brothers of same sibship exhibited about the same level of resemblance for all variables or were only slightly different, with the exception of HR max. Monozygotic pairs were generally more alike than the other sibs, as suggested by the intra-class coefficients. Twin data were used to compute the genetic effects. The within-pair estimate of genetic variance revealed that it was significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) for all variables except VO2 max X kg-1 fat-free weight X min-1. In the case of HR max, the among-pairs component estimate had to be used, and it also proved significant (P less than or equal to 0.01).

The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group.

The highway's southern terminus is the Mexican border and its northern terminus is the CanadaUS border; it is currently the only continuous Interstate highway to touch the U.S. borders with both Canada and Mexico. Upon crossing the Mexican border at its southern terminus, Interstate 5 continues to Tijuana, Baja California as Mexico Federal Highway 1.

( Another such split occurred in California , but with the decommissioning of US 99 , that state elected to rename its US 99W as Interstate 5 , rather than preserve the directional suffix ) . Currently , OR 99E and OR 99W do not have a northern junction in Oregon -- OR 99W has been truncated from its original route , and ends in downtown Portland , several miles south of its original northern terminus ; nor is OR 99 ( without a suffix ) signed anywhere in Portland .\\n\\n- Baja California, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California, is a state in Mexico.

It has an area of , or 3.57% of the land mass of Mexico and comprises the northern half of the Baja California Peninsula, north of the 28th parallel, plus oceanic Guadalupe Island. The mainland portion of the state is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by Sonora, the U.S. State of Arizona, and the Gulf of California (also known as the \\"Sea of Cortez\\"), and on the south by Baja California Sur.

Their relationship always seemed a bit contentious and somewhat immature, but 2 years is a long time at our age. \\n\\nCome second year in university, she now coincidentally (not sure if him being here influenced her) goes to our same university. They spend a lot of time together during the first few weeks. At that point it is my understanding that they briefly got back together, but that then falls through. Mean things are said, and the breakup isn't clean. \\n\\nMy friend is really defensive about our sports team, and has said he considers it his family. After the breakup he commanded her to stay away from the team, and the areas we usually hang out. I disagreed with this demand, because I believe that she has every right to fuck whoever she wants, even if he happens to be in our sports team. I tell him this, but anything that goes against his ironclad will was ignored and he would get very angry, despite having asked for my advice. \\n\\nCut forward to maybe a month into the year, I'm told by her on a night out, after she has an emotional outpouring and I give her some advice, that she fucked a guy on our sports team, and that my mate doesn't know about it.\\n\\nI didn't tell my friend, because I knew it would cause irreparable damage to his friendship with the team, and because of his anger and emotional issues that I know he has. I also fundamentally disagree with the way he tried and still tries to control her behaviour even though they are no longer together. Personally, I believe he had no right to know about her activities. \\n\\nThere was a short period of time where it seemed like they might get back together in January, despite mine and my housemates advice to the contrary. For a week they were back together, but it was clear they would fail, because the dynamic was the same as before, and nothing had changed. \\n\\nCome second semester, news gets around about everything and I still pretend that I have no idea. He now hates the other guy, whom he constantly talks about fighting and intimidating, and he has sent the girl threatening messages, and only now is ignoring her, after finally listening to my advice.  I even had to frase it as 'ignoring her to get back at her' when it's really just for his own sake.

In 2009, he co-produced and collaborated on Owl City's album \\"Ocean Eyes\\".\\n\\n- Relient K is an American rock band formed in 1998 in Canton, Ohio, by Matt Thiessen, Matt Hoopes, and Brian Pittman during the band members' third year in high school and their time at Malone University. The band is named after guitarist Hoopes' automobile, a Plymouth Reliant K car, with the spelling intentionally altered to avoid trademark infringement over the \\"Reliant\\" name.\\n\\n- A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.\\n\\n- Owl City is an American electronica project created in 2007 in Owatonna, Minnesota; it is one of several projects by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young. Young created the project while experimenting with music in his parents' basement. Owl City developed a following on the social networking site MySpace, like many musicians who achieved success in the late 2000s, before signing with Universal Republic Records, now Republic Records, in 2008.\\n\\n- The Burj al-Arab (\\"Tower of the Arabs\\") is a luxury hotel located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is the fourth tallest hotel in the world; however, 39% of its total height is made up of non-occupiable space. Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island from Jumeirah beach and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. The shape of the structure is designed to mimic the sail of a ship. \\nIt has a helipad near the roof at a height of above ground.\\n\\n- Universal Republic Records was an American record label, that operated as a division of Universal Music Group. It was based on the then-defunct Republic Records label founded by brothers Monte and Avery Lipman. In the summer of 2011, changes were made at one of the three Universal Music Group umbrella labels, Universal Motown Republic Group, and Motown Records was separated from Universal Motown Records (causing it to shut down and transfer its artists to either Motown Records or Universal Republic Records) and the umbrella label and merged into The Island Def Jam Music Group, making Universal Republic Records a stand-alone label and shutting down Universal Motown Republic Group. In mid-2012, the label reverted to its original Republic Records name, making this label defunct.\\n\\n- Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.\\n\\n- Christian rock is a form of rock music that promotes Jesus and is typically performed by self-proclaimed Christian individuals and bands whose members focus the lyrics on matters of Christian faith. The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent.\\n\\n- A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". \\n\\n- Canton is a city in and the county seat of Stark County, Ohio, United States. Founded in 1805 alongside the Middle and West Branches of Nimishillen Creek, Canton became a heavy manufacturing center because of its numerous railroad lines. However, its status in that regard began to decline during the late 20th century, as shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation or repositioning of many factories. After this decline, the city's industry diversified into the service economy, including retailing, education, finance and healthcare.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'record label' with the subject 'fireflies '? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1995\\n - album\\n - american record company\\n - country music\\n - digital\\n - hello\\n - island\\n - itunes\\n - labels\\n - pop\\n - record\\n - republic records\\n - rock music\\n - service\\n - the island def jam music group\\n - universal music group\\n - universal republic records","target":"universal republic records","rationale":"fireflies was released by universal republic records, so the answer is \\"universal republic records\\"."},{"source":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\\nArticle: If you do not use your arms or your legs for some time, they become weak; when you start using them again, they slowly become strong again.

Passage:The Prodigal Son is a best-selling novel by Hall Caine, published in November 1904 by Heinemann and translated into thirteen languages. It is set in a sheep-rearing community in rural Iceland, with scenes in London and the French Riviera. At the same time Caine adapted the novel into a play. The copyright performance was held at the Grand Theatre, Douglas, Isle of Man. American and British productions opened days apart in 1905, at the National Theatre in Washington, D. C. on 28 August, the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City on 4 September and at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London on 7 September, with George Alexander playing Oscar and Caine's sister Lilian playing Thora. After a long run at Drury Lane it was revived in 1907. In The Prodigal Son Magnus learns on his wedding day that his bride, Thora, is in love with his brother Oscar, a composer. She marries Oscar after Magnus releases her from the engagement. When Thora dies, a distraught Oscar places the only copies of his compositions in her coffin. Later he has her grave opened and his music retrieved. It was filmed in 1923. A.E.

L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building. In 1955 Dallas Barrack, a Springdale antique dealer, bought Oklahoma Row, and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries.

She  credits Julia Child for  her  TV break. After coming to one of  Bastianich âs restaurant  Child âwanted me to teach  her  how to make risotto and then  she  had me on  her  show. The producer then said âyouâre pretty good. How about a show of your own?â And thatâs how it evolved â  she  remembers. Child âencouraged me.  She  said âLidia  you do for Italian cuisine what I do for French.â We remained friends.â\\nIn real life   Bastianich  has a no-nonsense but warm demeanor  which  she  exudes on  her  show. Countless hours spent watching  her  on TV gave me the false sense that we were old friends and at times during our meal  as  she  doted on me  it felt like I had found my long-lost nonna.\\nâA lot of adults tell me âI watched [the show] since I was a kid with grandma.â You know what that tells me? Itâs been a few years â  she  jokes. âIt pleases me because food is all about bringing people together and relating to each other â  she  adds more seriously.\\nBut even after decades of cooking on TV  running a restaurant empire and helping to start the wildly popular chain of Eataly stores   she  insists that  she  still enjoys cooking at home. In fact   she  just published  her  eleventh book  Lidiaâs Celebrate Like an Italian  which  she  co-wrote with  her  daughter  Tanya Bastianich Manuali  and includes 220 recipes for everything from cocktails to soup to dessert. âI havenât invented one of them â  she  admits. âI modified some. Iâve changed a little bit here and there.â\\nIf anything   she âs too modest and was very concerned about making the recipes as approachable as possible. âI take these recipes and simplify them as much as I can â  she  says  since  she  actually wants the reader to learn them and enjoy using them. While in  her  restaurants  the emphasis is the opposite  itâs âto create that moment that the guest will not be able to do at home.â Most of the dishes at Del Posto certainly would fit into that category. Speaking of which  when I try to get  her  to order more food for  herself   in true grandmother fashion   she  dodges my suggestions and insists âI can talk while you eat.â\\nWhile I enjoy a delicious heirloom tomato salad  the aforementioned pasta and perfectly cooked swordfish fillets   she  shares with me  her  familyâs fascinating story of coming to America.  She  was born in Istria  which before World War II was part of Italy  but afterwards became part of communist Yugoslavia.  Her  family fled to Italy and lived in a refugee camp for two years before emigrating to America when  she  was 12. Itâs an experience that  she  thinks a lot about today as the country debates its policies about letting in immigrants. âMost of us are immigrants except for the Indians â  she  says. And for  her  that struggle is personal and one that is wrapped up with being a chef. âFood is all about the story of a people through the ages â  she  reminds me.\\nWhen  her  family got to America  she  was in for a surprise. âThe Italian food I didnât recognize it when we first came here â  she  says since it was so different than what  she  had grown up eating.  She  did  however  immediately fall in love with boxed cake mixes that  she  would whip up each night. Catholic Relief Services put them up in a hotel for three weeks when they first arrived and then  her  father found a job and a small apartment in Queens that they moved into.\\n She âs reticent to tell me more  since  she âs working on a memoir that should be out next year  which will go into greater detail about  her  familyâs story and  her  rise to culinary stardom.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London.\\nNumerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire.

The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.","target":"Vulgate Cycle","rationale":"The passage mentions the Vulgate Cycle and its continuation of a trend towards reducing Arthur’s role in his own legend. It is followed by another cycle, which it refers to as the Post-Vulgate Cycle, that also continues this trend. So, “the two names of the cycle” are referring to these two cycles mentioned in the text – namely, the Vulgate Cycle and the Post-Vulgate Cycle – so this would be your answer choice for question 1 above (Question 3)."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a question, a context passage, and four options which are terms from the passage.

Passage:William Havemeyer (1770-1851) left Germany at age 15 and arrived in New York City after learning the trade of sugar refining in London. In New York he managed a sugar house on Pine Street before opening his own refinery on Vandam Street with his brother, Frederick Christian Havemeyer, who had come to New York in 1802. Together the two brothers operated the W. & F.C. Havemeyer Company sugar refineries, before passing the business on to their sons. His son William Frederick Havemeyer, retired from the sugar refining business in 1842 and entered politics, eventually serving three terms as Mayor of New York. In 1855 the family relocated their refineries to Brooklyn, where they remained as the business grew to acquire a commanding share of the United States sugar refining market under the leadership of Frederick's grandson, Henry Osborne Havemeyer. The Havemeyer refineries were incorporated as the American Sugar Refining Company in 1891 and became known as Domino Sugar in 1900. In the 20th century several of the family's members made notable contributions to the arts.

September 30] 1739 - October 16 [O.S. October 5] 1791) was a Russian military leader, statesman, nobleman and favourite of Catherine the Great. He died during negotiations over the Treaty of Jassy, which ended a war with the Ottoman Empire that he had overseen. Potemkin was born into a family of middle-income noble landowners.\\n\\nA distant relative of the Moscovite diplomat Pyotr Potemkin (1617-1700), Grigory was born in the village of Chizhovo near Smolensk into a family of middle-income noble landowners. The family claimed Polish ancestry. His father, Alexander Potemkin, was a decorated war veteran; his mother Daria was \\"good-looking, capable and intelligent\\", though their marriage proved ultimately unhappy. Potemkin received his first name in honour of his father's cousin Grigory Matveevich Kizlovsky, a civil servant who became his godfather. It has been suggested that Kizlovsky fathered Potemkin, who became the centre of attention, heir to the village and the only son among six children. As the son of an (albeit petty) noble family, he grew up with the expectation that he would serve the Russian Empire.  After Alexander died in 1746, Daria took charge of the family. In order to achieve a career for her son, and aided by Kizlovsky, the family moved to Moscow, where Potemkin enrolled at a gymnasium school attached to the University of Moscow. The young Potemkin became adept at languages and interested in the Russian Orthodox Church. He enlisted in the army in 1750 at age eleven, in accordance with the custom of noble children. In 1755 a second inspection placed him in the elite Horse Guards regiment . Having graduated from the University school, Potemkin became one of the first students to enroll at the University itself. Talented in both Greek and theology, he won the University's Gold Medal in 1757 and became part of a twelve-student delegation sent to Saint Petersburg later that year. The trip seems to have affected Potemkin: afterwards he studied little and was soon expelled. Faced with isolation from his family, he rejoined the Guards, where he excelled. At this time his net worth amounted to 430 souls (serfs), equivalent to that of the poorer gentry. His time was taken up with \\"drinking, gambling, and promiscuous lovemaking\\", and he fell deep in debt.  Grigory Orlov, one of Catherine's lovers, led a palace coup in June 1762 that ousted the Emperor Peter III and enthroned Catherine II. Sergeant Potemkin represented his regiment in the revolt. Allegedly, as Catherine reviewed her troops in front of the Winter Palace before their march to the Peterhof, she lacked a sword-knot (or possibly hat plumage), which Potemkin quickly supplied. Potemkin's horse then (appeared to) refuse to leave her side for several minutes before Potemkin and horse returned to the ranks. After the coup Catherine singled out Potemkin for reward and ensured his promotion to second lieutenant. Though Potemkin was among those guarding the ex-Tsar, it appears that he had no direct involvement in Peter's murder in July. Catherine promoted him again to Kammerjunker (gentleman of the bedchamber), though he retained his post in the Guards. Potemkin was soon formally presented to the Empress as a talented mimic; his imitation of her was well received.  Potemkin then embarked on a period of city-founding. Construction started at his first effort, Kherson, in 1778, as a base for a new Black Sea Fleet he intended to build. Potemkin approved every plan himself, but construction was slow, and the city proved costly and vulnerable to plague. Next was the port of Akhtiar, annexed with the Crimea, which became Sevastopol. Then he built Simferopol as the Crimean capital. His biggest failure, however, was his effort to build the city of Ekaterinoslav (lit. The glory of Catherine), now Dnipropetrovsk. The second most successful city of Potemkin's rule was Nikolayev (now better known as Mykolaiv), which he founded in 1789. Potemkin also initiated the redesign of Odessa after its capture from the Turks; it was to turn out to be the greatest.  Potemkin's Black Sea Fleet was a massive undertaking for its time. By 1787, the British ambassador reported twenty-seven battleships. It put Russia on a naval footing with Spain, though far behind the British Navy. The period represented the peak of Russia's naval power relative to other European states. Potemkin also rewarded hundreds of thousands of settlers who moved into his territories. It is estimated that by 1782 the populations of Novorossiya and Azov had doubled during a period of \\"exceptionally rapid\\" development. Immigrants included Russians, foreigners, British convicts diverted from Australia, Cossacks and controversially Jews. Though the immigrants were not always happy in their new surroundings, on at least one occasion Potemkin intervened directly to ensure families received the cattle to which they were entitled. Outside of Novorossiya he drew up the defensive Azov-Mozdok line, constructing forts at Georgievsk, Stavropol and elsewhere and ensured that the whole of the line was settled.  In 1784 Lanskoy died and Potemkin was needed at court to console the grieving Catherine. After Alexander Yermolov was installed as the new favorite in 1785, Catherine, Yermolov and Potemkin cruised the upper Volga. When Yermolov attempted to unseat Potemkin (and attracted support from Potemkin's critics), he found himself replaced by Count Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov in the summer of 1786. Potemkin returned to the south, having arranged that Catherine would visit in the summer of 1787. She reached Kiev in late January, to travel down the Dnieper after the ice had melted (see Crimean journey of Catherine the Great). Potemkin had other lovers at this time, including a 'Countess' Sevres and a Naryshkina. Leaving in April, the royal party arrived in Kherson a month later. On visiting Sevastopol, Austria's Joseph II, who was traveling with them, was moved to note that \\"The Empress is totally ecstatic... Prince Potemkin is at the moment all-powerful\\".  Potemkin fell ill in the fever-ridden city of Jassy, though he kept busy, overseeing peace talks, planning his assault on Poland and preparing the army for renewed war in the south. He fasted briefly and recovered some strength, but refused medicine and began to feast once again, consuming a \\"ham, a slated goose and three or four chickens\\". On October 13 [O.S. October 2], he felt better and dictated a letter to Catherine before collapsing once more. Later, he awoke and dispatched his entourage to Nikolayev. On October 16 [O.S. October 5] 1791 Potemkin died in the open steppe, 40 miles from Jassy. Picking up on contemporary rumor, historians such as the Polish Jerzy Lojek have suggested that he was poisoned because his madness made him a liability, but this is rejected by Montefiore, who suggests he succumbed to bronchial pneumonia instead.  Potemkin was embalmed and a funeral was held for him in Jassy. Eight days after his death, he was buried. Catherine was distraught and ordered social life in St. Petersburg be put on hold. Derzhavin's ode Waterfall lamented his death; likewise many in the military establishment had looked upon Potemkin as a father figure and were especially saddened by his death. Polish contemporary Stanislaw Malachowski claimed that Aleksandra von Engelhardt, a niece of Potemkin and wife to Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, a magnate and prominent leader of the Targowica Confederation, also worried for the fate of Poland after the death of the man who had planned to revitalise the Polish state with him as its new head. Potemkin had used the state treasury as a personal bank, preventing the resolution of his financial affairs to this day. Catherine purchased the Tauride Palace and his art collection from his estate, and paid off his debts. Consequently, he left a relative fortune. Catherine's son Paul, who succeeded to the throne in 1796, attempted to undo as many of Potemkin's reforms as possible. The Tauride Palace was turned into a barracks, and the city of Gregoripol, which had been named in Potemkin's honor, was renamed.  Potemkin's grave survived a destruction order issued by Paul and was eventually displayed by the Bolsheviks. His remains now appear to lie in his tomb at St. Catherine's Cathedral in Kherson. The exact whereabouts of some of his internal organs, including his heart and brain first kept at Golia Monastery in Jassy, remain unknown.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: When did Grigory die?","target":"On October 16 [O.S.

The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.

Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.\\n\\n- Henri or Hendrik Conscience (3 December 1812  10 September 1883) was a Belgian author. He is considered the pioneer of Dutch-language literature in Flanders, writing at a time when Belgium was dominated by the French language among the upper classes, in literature and government. Conscience fought as a Belgian revolutionary in 1830 and was a notable writer in the Romanticist style popular in the early 19th century. He is best known for his romantic nationalist novel, \\"De Leeuw van Vlaenderen\\" (1838), inspired by the victory of a Flemish peasant militia over French knights at the 1302 Battle of the Golden Spurs during the Franco-Flemish War.\\n\\n- The Battle of the Golden Spurs, also known as the Battle of Courtrai, was a battle fought between the Kingdom of France and the County of Flanders at Kortrijk (Courtrai in French) in modern-day Belgium on 11 July 1302.\\n\\n- Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.\\n\\n- The High Middle Ages or High Medieval Period was the period of European history around the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 10011300).

Together with Jan Breydel , a butcher , he was in the forefront of the popular uprising that led to the Battle of the Golden Spurs . Right before that battle he was knighted together with two of his sons . Before the Battle of the Golden Spurs began he was seen by the city government of Bruges as a dangerous agitator and was imprisoned in June 1301 . He was freed by the people of Bruges . Afterwards , the Leliaarts , a political faction supporting French rule , took over control of the city . Jacques de Châtillon , the then appointed governor of County of Flanders , entered Bruges with a small force and de Coninck was banished .

The lake is shared by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north, the US state of Minnesota to the west, and Wisconsin and Michigan to the south. It is generally considered the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area. It is the world's third-largest freshwater lake by volume and the largest by volume in North America.\\n\\n- A university system is a set of multiple, affiliated universities and colleges that are usually geographically distributed. Typically, all member universities in a university system share a common component among all of their various names. Usually, all member universities of a university system are governed by a system-wide governing body, such as a board of trustees or a board of regents. In fact, university systems are so common in post-World War II United States that most states have one or two state university systems under which many of their publicly funded universities are aligned, both in name and in governance. Additionally, for-profit universities, such as DeVry University, often have multiple campuses which share the same name; these may be, but are not always, described as a university system (not necessarily accurately, see below).\\n\\n- DeVry University is an American for-profit college. The school was founded in 1931 as DeForest Training School, and officially became DeVry University in 2002.\\n\\n- Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit.\\n\\n- A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).\\n\\n- Wisconsin is a U.S. state located in the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions. It is bordered by Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the northeast, and Lake Superior to the north. Wisconsin is the 23rd largest state by total area and the 20th most populous. The state capital is Madison, and its largest city is Milwaukee, which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The state is divided into 72 counties.\\n\\n- The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganHuron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis.\\n\\n- Milwaukee is the largest city in the state of Wisconsin and the fifth-largest city in the Midwestern United States.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- A state university system in the United States is a group of public universities supported by an individual state, or a similar entity such as the District of Columbia. These systems constitute the majority of public-funded universities in the country. Each state supports at least one such system.\\n\\n- Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\").\\nMinnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation.\\nMinnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.\\n\\n- Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.\\n\\n- Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within the United States. The other four Great Lakes are shared by the U.S. and Canada. It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third-largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia). To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake.\\nLake Michigan is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include, Chicago, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gary, Indiana, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The word \\"Michigan\\" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word \\"mishigami\\" meaning \\"great water\\".\\nIn the earliest European maps of the region, the name of Lake Illinois has been found in addition to that of \\"Michigan\\".\\n\\n- The University of Wisconsin System is a university system of public universities in the state of Wisconsin .

All of his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ireland.\\n\\nHannity is notable for his pro-Trump coverage. According to the Washington Post, \\"Hannity's comeback coincided with his early, eager embrace of his fellow New Yorker... Trump attacked the Gold Star father, and Hannity stood by him. Trump went after a federal judge of Mexican descent, and Hannity backed him. Even after the \\"Access Hollywood\\" tape emerged of Trump boasting about grabbing women, Hannity defended his guy: \\"King David had 500 concubines, for crying out loud.\\" After the inauguration, the first interview the new president gave to a cable news channel went to Hannity.\\" Hannity also defended the Trump administration's false claim that Trump's inauguration crowd was the biggest ever.  Hannity was criticized by some, especially supporters of Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, as being overly favorable to the candidacy of Donald Trump and granting Trump more airtime than other presidential candidates during the 2016 primaries. Hannity, for instance, let Donald Trump promote the false conspiracy theory that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the John F Kennedy assassination. During interviews, Hannity \\"frequently cites areas where he agrees with Trump, or where he thinks Trump was right about something, then asks him to expand on it\\", and \\"often ignores or defends Trump from criticism,\\" according to a CNN report. Tensions between Cruz and Hannity appeared to reach a boiling point during a contentious April 2016 radio interview, during which Cruz implied Hannity was a \\"hard-core Donald Trump supporter\\" and Hannity responded by accusing Cruz of \\"throw[ing] this in my face\\" every time he asked a \\"legitimate question\\". Jim Rutenberg reported in August 2016 that Hannity is \\"not only Mr. Trump's biggest media booster; he also veers into the role of adviser,\\" citing sources who said Hannity spent months offering suggestions to Trump and his campaign on strategy and messaging.

It is also generated endogenously by lipid peroxidation and the oxidation of amino acids by myeloperoxidase. In animals, acrolein exposure is associated with the suppression of circulating progenitor cells and increases in thrombosis and atherogenesis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether acrolein exposure in humans is also associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.', 'Acrolein exposure was assessed in 211 participants of the Louisville Healthy Heart Study with moderate to high (CVD) risk by measuring the urinary levels of the major acrolein metabolite-3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (3-HPMA). Generalized linear models were used to assess the association between acrolein exposure and parameters of CVD risk, and adjusted for potential demographic confounders. Urinary 3-HPMA levels were higher in smokers than nonsmokers and were positively correlated with urinary cotinine levels. Urinary 3-HPMA levels were inversely related to levels of both early (AC133(+)) and late (AC133(-)) circulating angiogenic cells. In smokers as well as nonsmokers, 3-HPMA levels were positively associated with both increased levels of platelet-leukocyte aggregates and the Framingham Risk Score.

By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover.

In the present study it is demonstrated that human platelet-derived cationic proteins (HuPlt CP), which are able to increase cutaneous vascular permeability, bind in vitro to the GCW following incubation of normal human kidney sections with purified HuPlt CP or with washed human platelets stimulated with thrombin, immune complexes (IC) and platelet-activating factor (PAF), or stimulated with a suspension of washed human platelets and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of phagocytable substrate. The antiserum used in immunofluorescence test to detect the binding of HuPlt CP was specific for two different molecular types of HuPlt CP, both with an isoelectric point (pI) of 10.5. Glomerular deposits of HuPlt CP were also detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy in renal glomeruli present in tissue obtained by biopsy from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease in which platelets have been implicated as mediator of glomerular injury. These data indicate that when activated platelets release HuPlt CP in vivo, these proteins bind to glomerular structures. The binding of HuPlt CP to GCW appears to be ionic in nature since heparin, a polyanion, prevents this binding in vitro. In addition, heparin, as well as a high molarity buffer, removed deposits of HuPlt CP bound in vitro to normal GCW or bound in vivo to glomeruli of patients with SLE. The binding of HuPlt CP to GCW is associated with loss of colloidal iron staining, a qualitative technique that demonstrates primarily epithelial cell surface anionic sialoglycoproteins. In experiments of in vitro binding of purified HuPlt CP to section of normal kidney treatment with heparin completely restores the normal pattern of colloidal iron staining suggesting ionic neutralization of GPA. In contrast, heparin is only partially effective in restoring colloidal iron staining in normal kidney sections treated with platelets directly stimulated with IC or PAF or in kidney sections of patients with SLE. These observations indicate that under these conditions the ionic interaction of HuPlt CP with GCW is only partially responsible for the loss of colloidal iron staining. The results of the present study suggest that biologically active polycationic mediators released from stimulated platelets localize in GCW and participate in the induction of glomerular injury.","target":"Adult","rationale":"The paper is about the study of platelet-derived cationic proteins that increase cutaneous vascular permeability and bind to kidney structures in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

It is organisms, whether single- or multi-cellular, that produce new organisms. As we will discuss in detail when we consider the origins of multicellular organisms, a cell within a multicellular organism normally cannot survive outside the organism nor can it produce a new organism - it depends upon cooperation with the other cells of the organism. In fact, each multicellular organism is an example of a cooperative, highly integrated social system. The cells of a typical multicellular organism are part of a social system in which most cells have given up their ability to reproduce a new organism; their future depends upon the reproductive success of the organism of which they are a part. It is the organism’s success in generating new organisms that underlies evolution’s selective mechanisms. Within the organism, the cells that give rise to the next generation of organism are known as germ cells, those that do not (that is, the cells that die when the organism dies) are known as somatic cells.47 All organisms in the modern world, and for apparently the last ~3.5-3.8 billion years, arise from a pre-existing organism or, in the case of sexually reproducing organisms, from the cooperation of two organisms, an example of social evolution that we will consider in greater detail in Chapter 4. We will also see that breakdowns in such social systems can lead to the death of the organism or the disruption of the social system. Cancer is the most obvious example of an anti-social behavior; in evolutionary terms, it can, initially, be rewarded (more copies of the cancerous cell are produced) but ultimately leads to the extinction of the cancer, and often the death of the organism within which the cancer occurs.48 This is because evolutionary mechanisms are not driven by long term outcomes, but only by immediate ones.

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors.

Hester's new lover has awakened her sexuality, but the reckless, thrill-seeking Freddie can never give her the love and stability that her husband gave.

Working exclusively in short films, he has produced almost forty works since 1937, nine of which have been grouped together as the \\"Magick Lantern Cycle\\". His films variously merge surrealism with homoeroticism and the occult, and have been described as containing \\"elements of erotica, documentary, psychodrama, and spectacle\\". Anger himself has been described as \\"one of America's first openly gay filmmakers, and certainly the first whose work addressed homosexuality in an undisguised, self-implicating manner\\", and his \\"role in rendering gay culture visible within American cinema, commercial or otherwise, is impossible to overestimate\\", with several being released prior to the legalization of homosexuality in the United States.\\n\\nIn 1953, soon after the production of Eaux d'Artifice, Anger's mother died and he temporarily returned to the United States in order to assist with the distribution of her estate. It was during this return that he began to once more immerse himself in the artistic scene of California, befriending the film maker Stan Brakhage, who had been inspired by Fireworks, and the two collaborated on producing a film, but it was confiscated at the film lab for obscenity and presumably destroyed. Around this time, two of Anger's friends, the couple Renate Druks and Paul Mathiesin held a party based upon the theme of \\"Come As Your Madness\\"; Anger himself attended dressed in drag as the ancient Greek goddess Hekate. The party and its many costumes inspired Anger, who produced a painting of it, and asked several of those who attended to appear in a new film that he was creating - Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Inauguration, which was created in 1954, was a 38-minute surrealist work featuring many Crowleyan and Thelemite themes, with many of the various characters personifying various pagan gods such as Isis, Osiris and Pan. One of the actresses in the film was Marjorie Cameron, the widow of Jack Parsons, the influential American Thelemite who had died a few years previously, while Anger himself played Hecate. He would subsequently exhibit the film at various European film festivals, winning the Prix du Cine-Club Belge and the Prix de l'Age d'Or, as well as screening it in the form of a projected triptych at Expo 58, the World Fair held in Brussels in 1958.  In 1955, Anger and his friend Alfred Kinsey traveled to the derelict Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu, Sicily, to film a short documentary titled Thelema Abbey. The abbey itself had been used by Aleister Crowley for his commune during the 1920s, and Anger restored many of the erotic wall-paintings that were found there, as well as performing certain Crowleyan rituals at the site. The documentary was made for the British television series Omnibus, but was later lost. The following year Kinsey died and Anger decided to return to Paris, where he was described at the time as being \\"extremely remote and lonely\\".  In desperate need of money, Anger wrote a book titled Hollywood Babylon in which he collected together gossip regarding celebrities, some of which he claims he had been told. This included claiming (with no corroboration or citing of sources) that Rudolph Valentino liked to play a sexually submissive role to dominant women, that Walt Disney was a drug user, addicted to opiates (reflected in the character of Goofy, who's perpetually stoned on cannabis), as well as describing the nature of the deaths of Peg Entwistle and Lupe Velez. The work was not published in the United States initially, and it was first released by the French publisher Jean-Jacques Pauvert. A pirated (and incomplete) version was first published in the U.S. in 1965, with the official American version not being published until 1974. Now with some financial backing from the publication of Hollywood Babylon, his next film project was The Story of O; essentially a piece of erotica featuring a heterosexual couple engaged in sadomasochistic sexual activities, although it refrained from showing any explicit sexual images.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Kenneth Anger","rationale":"The context is a biography of the influential American filmmaker Kenneth Anger.

The Saints responded with a Garrett Hartley 33-yard field goal. Atlanta responded with another Matt Bryant 30-yard field goal to take 6-3 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Saints would come out strong in the second quarter, when RB Reggie Bush scored on a 6-yard pass from Drew Brees to take a 10-6 lead. The Saints continued to move the ball and added onto the lead with a Marques Colston 3-yard touchdown catch from Drew Brees. Garrett Hartley kick failed giving the Saints a 16-6 lead in the second quarter. The Falcons troubles would continue. After failing to score a touchdown for the third time in the first half, Atlanta settled for a Matt Bryant 27-yard field goal to get within a touchdown at halftime.

The band has released eight studio albums, out of which the first three were recorded under R.E.X. Records with their original vocalist Darren Johnson as a more thrash metal and death metal oriented band. The band evolved into a groove metal/metalcore style beginning with \\"Reborn\\" (1997) under Solid State Records with the original guitarist Bruce Fitzhugh on vocals. In 2003, the group split up, due to other projects and later their label, Solid State, released their best-of album, \\"In Memoriam\\" (2005). In 2008, Living Sacrifice reformed and released a two-song digital only single called \\"Death Machine\\". They then began working on \\"The Infinite Order\\" which was released on January 26, 2010. Lance Garvin and Bruce Fitzhugh are the two remaining original members.\\n\\n- Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.\\n\\n- Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.\\n\\n- Solid State Records is a Christian record label, an imprint of Tooth & Nail Records. Unlike Tooth & Nail, Solid State signs hardcore punk and heavy metal bands. Like Tooth & Nail, Solid State is primarily a Christian label. However, they have signed several bands with Christian members that don't label themselves as Christian bands, including Stretch Arm Strong, Gwen Stacy, He Is Legend, the Famine, Training for Utopia, and the Agony Scene. The label is best known for Norma Jean, Beloved, Zao and Stretch Arm Strong.\\n\\n- The Infinite Order is the seventh studio album from Christian metal band Living Sacrifice released January 26, 2010. The album, produced by Jeremiah Scott and mixed by Andy Sneap marks a return for the band since their prior album in 2002. Because the manufacturer used the wrong master, the first pressing has an additional song \\"Of My Flesh, Of My Heart\\" on track 12 that was intended to be a bonus track on a possible European release. Future pressings will have the intended 11 tracks. They have since made a deluxe edition of the album available only through iTunes. The deluxe edition features new artwork, one bonus studio track, two live bonus tracks, and the \\"In Finite\\" Live DVD. Music videos were made for the songs \\"Rules of Engagement\\" and \\"Overkill Exposure\\". \\"Love Forgives\\" is inspired by the book of 1 Corinthians 13.\\n\\n- Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.\\n\\n- Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.\\n\\n- Bruce Fitzhugh is the second and best known lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and founding member of Arkansas's Christian metal band Living Sacrifice. The lead vocalist role was left to Bruce shortly after the departure of former lead Darren Johnson and prior to the recording of Living Sacrifice's 1997 album, \\"Reborn\\". Fitzhugh is featured in Zao's \\"The Lesser Lights of Heaven\\" DVD. Fitzhugh's nephew is Drew Garrison, Vocalist for Descended From Wolves.\\n\\n- The Hammering Process is the fifth album by the Christian metal band Living Sacrifice . This is the first album to feature percussionist Matthew Putman , guitarist Rocky Gray and bassist Arthur Green .

A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, \\"Anywhere but Home\\", which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, the band released their second studio album, \\"The Open Door\\", which sold more than five million copies.\\n\\n- We Are the Fallen is an American-Irish gothic metal band consisting of former \\"American Idol\\" contestant Carly Smithson, Marty O'Brien and former Evanescence members Ben Moody, John LeCompt, and Rocky Gray. The band's name is an allusion to Evanescence's 2003 album, \\"Fallen\\", which has resulted in criticism for their similar style to Evanescence. In a \\"Los Angeles Times\\" interview, co-founder of Evanescence, Ben Moody, said that We Are the Fallen differs from Evanescence in that \\"everyone is equal\\" and that it has \\"more energy than Evanescence could ever muster.\\" He also stated, \\"We cannot try to be who we are. If there is some similarity in sound, it's because that genre was created by us.\\"\\n\\n- William Rocky Gray (born July 2, 1974) is a drummer and guitarist who has been part of the Arkansas metal scene since the early 1990s. He has an extensive career as a musician and is best known as the lead guitarist for Living Sacrifice and Solus Deus, and the drummer for We Are the Fallen. He also plays drums for Soul Embraced, Mourningside, and Machina and he is the former drummer for Evanescence. Gray is also currently doing a solo album titled \\"Accursed\\".\\n\\n- R.E.X. Records was an independent record label founded by Doug Mann and Gavin Morkel, which operated from 1987 until running into financial difficulty in 1995. Operations were based in Chicago until 1990 when the company moved to Nashville. The label was artistic in nature, and though they were especially active in the Christian metal genre some acts (such as Circle of Dust) were also marketed to mainstream audiences. Sublabels included Storyville Records and Street Level Records, founded by Randy Stonehill.\\n\\n- Groove metal (also known as post-thrash or neo-thrash) is a subgenre of heavy metal music. It is often used to describe Pantera, Exhorder and Machine Head. At its core, groove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of thrash metal and plays them at mid-tempo, with most bands making only occasional forays into fast tempo.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'the hammering process' and 'solid state records'?","target":"record label","rationale":"Solid State Records is a Christian record label.

Fish is recognized as the \\"pillar\\" of the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant and considered one of the best U.S. Secretaries of State by scholars, known for his judiciousness and efforts towards reform and diplomatic moderation. Fish settled the controversial Alabama Claims with Great Britain through his development of the concept of international arbitration. Fish kept the United States out of war with Spain over Cuban independence by coolly handling the volatile Virginius Incident. In 1875, Fish initiated the process that would ultimately lead to Hawaiian statehood, by having negotiated a reciprocal trade treaty for the island nation's sugar production. He also organized a peace conference and treaty in Washington D.C. between South American countries and Spain.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously.

Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward.

The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less than 1 kg.\\n\\nJohnathan is trying to find two blocks of wood with the same mass for a project he is working on.

John was a pious and dedicated Emperor who was determined to undo the damage to the empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.\\nDuring his twenty-five-year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the West and decisively defeated the Pechenegs at the Battle of Beroia. He thwarted Hungarian and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothair III against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.In the later part of his reign, John focused his activities on the East, personally leading numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. His campaigns fundamentally altered the balance of power in the East, forcing the Turks onto the defensive, while restoring many towns, fortresses, and cities across the peninsula to the Byzantines. He defeated the Danishmend Emirate of Melitene and reconquered all of Cilicia, while forcing Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, to recognise Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the Emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into the Holy Land at the head of the combined forces of the Empire and the Crusader states; yet despite his great vigour pressing the campaign, his hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies.

These ecosys- tems vary by temperature, pressure (in lakes), the amount of light that penetrates and the type of vegetation that lives there. Limnology is the study of bodies of fresh water and the organisms that live there. A lake has zones just like the ocean. The ecosystem of a lake is divided into three distinct zones (Figure 1.1): 1. The surface (littoral) zone is the sloped area closest to the edge of the water. 2. The open-water zone (also called the photic or limnetic zone) has abundant sunlight. 3. The deep-water zone (also called the aphotic or profundal zone) has little or no sunlight. There are several life zones found within a lake: In the littoral zone, sunlight promotes plant growth, which provides food and shelter to animals such as snails, insects, and fish. In the open-water zone, other plants and fish, such as bass and trout, live. The deep-water zone does not have photosynthesis since there is no sunlight. Most deep-water organisms are scavengers, such as crabs and catfish that feed on dead organisms that fall to the bottom of the lake. Fungi and bacteria aid in the decomposition in the deep zone. Though different creatures live in the oceans, ocean waters also have these same divisions based on sunlight with similar types of creatures that live in each of the zones. The three primary zones of a lake are the littoral, open-water, and deep-water zones. Wetlands are lands that are wet for significant periods of time. They are common where water and land meet. Wetlands can be large flat areas or relatively small and steep areas. Wetlands are rich and unique ecosystems with many species that rely on both the land and the water for survival. Only specialized plants are able to grow in these conditions. Wetlands tend have a great deal of biological diversity. Wetland ecosystems can also be fragile systems that are sensitive to the amount and quality of water present within them. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Marshes are shallow wetlands around lakes, streams, or the ocean where grasses and reeds are common, but trees are not (Figure 1.2). Frogs, turtles, muskrats, and many varieties of birds are at home in marshes. A salt marsh on Cape Cod in Mas- sachusetts. A swamp is a wetland with lush trees and vines found in low-lying areas beside slow-moving rivers (Figure 1.3). Like marshes, they are frequently or always inundated with water. Since the water in a swamp moves slowly, oxygen in the water is often scarce. Swamp plants and animals must be adapted for these low-oxygen conditions. Like marshes, swamps can be fresh water, salt water, or a mixture of both. As mentioned above, wetlands are home to many different species of organisms. Although they make up only 5% of the area of the United States, wetlands contain more than 30% of the plant types. Many endangered species live in wetlands, so wetlands are protected from human use. Wetlands also play a key biological role by removing pollutants from water. For example, they can trap and use fertilizer that has washed off a farmers field, and therefore they prevent that fertilizer from contaminating another body of water. Since wetlands naturally purify water, preserving wetlands also helps to maintain clean supplies of water. \\n Question: marshes are distinctive because","target":"grasses and reeds are common","rationale":"The question asks for a distinctive feature of marshes.

Civil disobedience is a symbolic or ritualistic violation of the law , rather than a rejection of the system as a whole . Civil disobedience is sometimes , though not always , defined as being nonviolent resistance .\\n\\n- A symbol is a mark, sign, or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols.Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for \\"STOP\\". On a map, a blue line might represent a river. Numerals are symbols for numbers. Alphabetic letters may be symbols for sounds. Personal names are symbols representing individuals. A red rose may symbolize love and compassion. The variable 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.\\n\\n- Civil resistance is political action that relies on the use of nonviolent resistance by civil groups to challenge a particular power, force, policy or regime. Civil resistance operates through appeals to the adversary, pressure and coercion: it can involve systematic attempts to undermine the adversary's sources of power, both domestic and international. Forms of action have included demonstrations, vigils and petitions; strikes, go-slows, boycotts and emigration movements; and sit-ins, occupations, and the creation of parallel institutions of government. Civil resistance movements' motivations for avoiding violence are generally related to context, including a society's values and its experience of war and violence, rather than to any absolute ethical principle. Cases of civil resistance can be found throughout history and in many modern struggles, against both tyrannical rulers and democratically elected governments. The phenomenon of civil resistance is often associated with the advancement of democracy.\\n\\n- A protest (also called a remonstrance, remonstration or demonstration) is an expression of bearing witness on behalf of an express cause by words or actions with regard to particular events, policies or situations. Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance.\\n\\n- Satyagraha It was a movement started by Gandhiji.(\\"satygraha\\")  loosely translated as \\"insistence on truth\\" (\\"satya\\" \\"truth\\"; \\"agraha\\" \\"insistence\\" or \\"holding firmly to\\") or \\"holding onto truth\\" or \\"truth force\\"  is a particular form of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance. The term \\"satyagraha\\" was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi (18691948). He deployed satyagraha in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced Martin Luther King, Jr.'s and James Bevel's campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States (19541968), and many other social justice and similar movements. Someone who practices satyagraha is a \\nsatyagrahi.\\n\\n- Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person).\\nGlobally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.\\nIn 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.\\nViolence in many forms is preventable.

This type of action highlights the desires of an individual or group that feels that something needs to change to improve the current condition of the resisting person or group.

Originally described by Carl Stål , the type species is Psaltoda moerens known as the redeye , and P. plaga is a well - known species from eastern Australia , known as the black prince . Fifteen species are recognised . Relationships of the species with each other remains unclear .\\n\\n- The cicadas (or ) are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. It is divided into the Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 1,300 species described from around the world; many undescribed species remain.\\n\\n- Leafhopper is a common name applied to any species from the family Cicadellidae. These minute insects, colloquially known as hoppers, are plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs, or trees. Their hind legs are modified for jumping, and are covered with hairs that facilitate the spreading of a secretion over their bodies that acts as a water repellent and carrier of pheromones. They undergo a partial metamorphosis, and have various host associations, varying from very generalized to very specific. Some species have a cosmopolitan distribution, or occur throughout the temperate and tropical regions. Some are pests or vectors of plant viruses and phytoplasmas. The family is distributed all over the world, and constitutes the second-largest hemipteran family, with at least 20,000 described species.\\n\\n- Angophora is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, described as a genus in 1797. It is endemic to Australia, where species are distributed in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. The centre of diversity is along the northern and central coast of New South Wales.\\n\\n- The Auchenorrhyncha (former synonym: \\"Cicadinea\\") suborder of the Hemiptera contains most of the familiar members of what was called the Homoptera  groups such as cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, and spittlebugs. The aphids and scale insects are the other well-known \\"Homoptera\\", and they are in the suborder Sternorrhyncha. Lesser-known insects largely regarded as Homoptera are the Coleorrhyncha. However, the taxonomic status of the Hemiptera and Homoptera is currently under investigation and discussion. See Heteroptera and Prosorrhyncha for more information.\\n\\n- The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of Hemipteran insects, in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but they are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which encase themselves in froth in springtime.\\n\\n- South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. It covers some of the most arid parts of the country. With a total land area of , it is the fourth-largest of Australia's states and territories. It has a total of 1.7 million people, and its population is the most highly centralised of any state in Australia, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs. Other population centres in the state are relatively small.\\n\\n- Queensland (abbreviated as QLD) is the second-largest and third-most-populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia. Situated in the north-east of the country, it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,750,500, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Often referred to as the \\"Sunshine State\\", Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy. Tourism in the state, fuelled largely by its warm tropical climate, is a major industry.\\n\\n- Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.\\n\\n- The Tettigarctidae, also known as the hairy cicadas, are a small relict (mostly extinct) family of primitive cicadas, containing a single genus Tettigarcta, with two extant species, one in southern Australia (\\"Tettigarcta crinita\\"), and the other in Tasmania (\\"Tettigarcta tomentosa\\"). Fossil taxa include \\"Paratettigarcta zealandica\\" from New Zealand.\\n\\n- Eucalyptus L'Heritier 1789 is a diverse genus of flowering trees and shrubs (including a distinct group with a multiple-stem mallee growth habit) in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. Members of the genus dominate the tree flora of Australia, and include the tallest known flowering plant on Earth. There are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of New Guinea and Indonesia. One species, \\"Eucalyptus deglupta,\\" ranges as far north as the Philippines. Of the 15 species found outside Australia, just nine are exclusively non-Australian. Species of eucalyptus are cultivated widely in the tropical and temperate world, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, China, and the Indian subcontinent. However, the range over which many eucalypts can be planted in the temperate zone is constrained by their limited cold tolerance. Australia is covered by of eucalypt forest, comprising three quarters of the area covered by native forest.\\n\\n- Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.\\n\\n- Psaltoda moerens, commonly known as the redeye, is an Australian species of cicada. It is distributed through the south-east of Australia, from southern Queensland to South Australia, as well as Tasmania. Populations can vary greatly between years; one year they may be present in large numbers and the next they may be entirely absent. They feed primarily on eucalyptus but also on \\"Angophora\\" trees. As they feed on tree sap they expel small droplets of clear waste fluid. When numbers are high, this can form a constant stream.\\n\\n- The Hemiptera or true bugs are an order of insects comprising some 50,000 to 80,000 species of groups such as the cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, and shield bugs. They range in size from to around , and share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts. The name \\"true bugs\\" is sometimes limited to the suborder Heteroptera.

The Early Cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways, and as a result, the decline and extinction of sauropods (except in South America). Many coastal shallows were created, and that caused Ichthyosaurs to die out. Mosasaurs evolved to replace them as head of the seas. Some island-hopping dinosaurs, like Eustreptospondylus, evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient Europe. Other dinosaurs rose up to fill the empty space that the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction left behind, such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus. Of the most successful would be the Iguanodon which spread to every continent. Seasons came back into effect and the poles got seasonally colder, but dinosaurs still inhabited this area like the Leaellynasaura which inhabited the polar forests year-round, and many dinosaurs migrated there during summer like Muttaburrasaurus. Since it was too cold for crocodiles, it was the last stronghold for large amphibians, like Koolasuchus. Pterosaurs got larger as species like Tapejara and Ornithocheirus evolved.\\nWhat is the answer to this question: What is the span of the Early Cretaceous?","target":"145 million to 100 million years","rationale":"The context states that the Early Cretaceous spans from 145 million to 100 million years ago."},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nIn the past, solar power was more expensive or less expensive than it is today? \\n\\n\\nParagraph :\\n\\nSolar power is expensive, but as demand increases technology improves and costs decrease.","target":"more expensive","rationale":"The context mentions that solar power is expensive, but as demand increases technology improves and costs decrease.
