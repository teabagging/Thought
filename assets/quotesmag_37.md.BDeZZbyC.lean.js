In particular, the potential for cocaine to precipitate life-threatening cardiac events needs to be reemphasized. We report the clinical and pathological findings in seven people in whom nonintravenous \\"recreational\\" use of cocaine was temporally related to acute myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, myocarditis, sudden death, or a combination of these events. We also review data on 19 previously reported cases of cocaine-related cardiovascular disorders. Analysis of all 26 patients indicated the following findings: the cardiac consequences of cocaine abuse are not unique to parenteral use of the drug, since nearly all the patients took the drug intranasally; underlying heart disease is not a prerequisite for cocaine-related cardiac disorders; seizure activity, a well-documented noncardiac complication of cocaine abuse, is neither a prerequisite for, nor an accompanying feature of, cardiac toxicity of cocaine; and the cardiac consequences of cocaine are not limited to massive doses of the drug. Although the pathogenesis of cardiac toxicity of cocaine remains incompletely defined, available circumstantial evidence suggests that cocaine has medical consequences that are equal in importance to its well-documented psychosocial consequences. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Acute cardiac events temporally related to cocaine abuse. option2: Observation of metabolites in the human brain by MR spectroscopy.","target":"Acute cardiac events temporally related to cocaine abuse","rationale":"The abstract describes the study of a series of patients who suffered from acute myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, myocarditis, sudden death due to cocaine abuse.

Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went to Paris, where he formed an alliance with Philip. He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support. Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John. John's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce; in early 1194 the king finally returned to England, and John's remaining forces surrendered.

In 1952, however, the FCC began licensing UHF channels, making it possible for cities such as San Diego to acquire more stations. Stations based in Mexico (with ITU prefixes of XE and XH) also serve the San Diego market.

For example let's take a sentence 'I voted for Obama because he was most aligned with my values, she said.' Here in this example 'I', 'my', and 'she' belong to the same cluster and 'Obama' and 'he' belong to the same cluster. Now let's discuss another example , original sentence: 'I voted for Trump because he was most aligned with my values',John said. Now here is the same sentence with resolved coreferences: 'John voted for Trump because Trump was most aligned with John's values',John said. \\n\\nSentence: Elizabeth moved her company from Sparta to Troy to save money on taxes; the taxes are much higher there. Question: Where are the taxes higher?","target":"Troy","rationale":"The correct answer to the question 'Where are the taxes higher?' is 'Sparta'. The reason is that Elizabeth moved her company from Sparta to Troy because of high tax rates. However, in order to understand this, coreference resolution is required. If we resolve coreferences in the sentence, then it will be: Elizabeth moved her company from Sparta to Troy because taxes are much higher there; the taxes are much higher there. Now, it's clear that Sparta has a high tax rate as compared to Troy.\\n\\n---"},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: Besides galleries what else was common in the churches\\nContext: Until the Church Building Act of 1818, the period saw relatively few churches built in Britain, which was already well-supplied, although in the later years of the period the demand for Non-conformist and Roman Catholic places of worship greatly increased. Anglican churches that were built were designed internally to allow maximum audibility, and visibility, for preaching, so the main nave was generally wider and shorter than in medieval plans, and often there were no side-aisles. Galleries were common in new churches. Especially in country parishes, the external appearance generally retained the familiar signifiers of a Gothic church, with a tower or spire, a large west front with one or more doors, and very large windows along the nave, but all with any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary. Where funds permitted, a classical temple portico with columns and a pediment might be used at the west front. Decoration inside was very limited, but churches filled up with monuments to the prosperous.","target":"no side-aisles","rationale":"The context says that Anglican churches were designed internally to have a wider and shorter nave with no side-aisles. The reason, according to the text, is so that it would be easier for preaching in this kind of church design.\\nIt also mentions other architectural elements such as galleries which are common across all kinds of churches built during this period. \\nSo if we exclude these facts from the above information, what else was unique about Anglican churches?

After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described... contains an answer for the question: What are the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses?, what is it ?","target":"Euridice","rationale":"The article mentions: \\"Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete.\\"\\nThese are the two works with identical names that were first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses.

While depressed women were just 12 per cent more likely to develop heart disease, those who were severely depressed were 78 per cent more likely. In fact, a 1998 study found that women who are depressed have a risk of dying from heart disease equal to that of women who smoke or who have high blood pressure.\\nThe link works the other way around, too: While about 1 in 20 American adults experience major depression in a given year, that number jumps to about one in three among those who have survived a heart attack.\\nThe more severe the depression, the more dangerous it is to your health. But some studies suggest that even mild depression, including feelings of hopelessness experienced over many years, may damage the heart. Other studies suggest depression may affect how well heart disease medications work.\\nResearchers are n' t sure what the connection between depression and heart disease is, but theories exist. One is that people who are depressed tend not to take very good care of themselves. They' re more likely to eat high-fat, high-calorie \\"comfort\\" foods, less likely to exercise, and more likely to smoke. But beyond lifestyle, there is probably also a physiological link between depression and heart disease. Recent studies found that people with severe depression tended to have a lack of heart-healthy 0-3 fatty acids. People who are depressed also often have high levels of stress hormones  .

He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.\\n\\nHint: Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it.

Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators and planning schemes, leaving the general framework virtually unchanged since its conception. In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework -- what we call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model w.r.t. the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction is not always correlated with downstream control performance. This observation highlights a critical flaw in the current MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions of future research for addressing this issue.","target":"We define, explore, and begin to address the objective mismatch issue in model-based reinforcement learning","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe define, explore, and begin to address the objective mismatch issue in model-based reinforcement learning.\\n\`;"},{"source":"Two analogies that relate objects to the associated rooms is given in the form \\"A : B.

The region forms the northern arc of the U.S. northeast megalopolis and as such, Greater Boston can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The MSA consists of most of the eastern third of Massachusetts, excluding the South Coast region and Cape Cod; while the CSA additionally includes the municipalities of Manchester (the largest city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire), Providence (the capital of the U.S. state of Rhode Island), Worcester, Massachusetts (the second largest city in New England), as well as the South Coast region and Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Greater Boston's most impactful contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education institutions and sports culture. Greater Boston also constitutes a region influential upon American history and industry. The region and the state of Massachusetts are global leaders in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.\\n\\n- Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.\\n\\n- Biotechnology is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or \\"any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use\\" (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Art. 2).

Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state.

This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.\\n\\n- Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States.

Though lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally diverse region. Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent.\\n\\n- A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.\\nA metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.\\n\\n- Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management.

He has also played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, Washington Wizards and Dallas Mavericks. Yi joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 2002-03 CBA season, and subsequently won the CBA Rookie of the Year award. In his first five years with Guangdong, the team won three CBA titles.\\n\\nYi was not expected to enter the NBA draft until 2009 because the Chinese Basketball Association ruled that players are not allowed to leave for foreign leagues until they turned 22. In early 2006, however, Yi announced that he would enter the 2006 NBA draft although he eventually decided to withdraw, saying he was \\"not good enough to compete in the NBA and needed more experience.\\" Later that year, the Guangdong Southern Tigers announced that Yi would enter the 2007 NBA draft.  Yi chose Dan Fegan as his agent to represent him in the NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted by many to be picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them to be one of the teams invited to Yi's pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian-American community. However, Milwaukee's general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016.  After the draft, Milwaukee attempted to convince Yi to sign with the team and on 2 July 2007, the owner of the Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time.

They “time-block” their writing in advance\\nScheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week.\\nWhat seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful.\\n“When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.”\\nQuestion: How long did it probably take the author to collect all of his research prior to creating Prolifiko?\\nAnswer:","target":"years","rationale":"In the context, it explains that there are certain habits a prolific writer has when writing. The author said he interviewed 23 scholars and found 6 common \\"habits\\" of writers. These six habits were then used to help create Prolifiko (a tool for students). \\nThe contexts show that time was taken to research these habits before creating this website, which means it took years rather than days or weeks.

However, in members of the tube-dwelling family Siboglinidae the gut is blocked by a swollen lining that houses symbiotic bacteria, which can make up 15% of the worms' total weight. The bacteria convert inorganic matter – such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from hydrothermal vents, or methane from seeps – to organic matter that feeds themselves and their hosts, while the worms extend their palps into the gas flows to absorb the gases needed by the bacteria.","target":"worms","rationale":"The gut is the tube within a worm that helps digest food.

However, there are some worms in which the symbiotic bacteria housed inside block up its gut and these can make up 15% or more of their weight. Members absorb gases from hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide to help feed themselves and their hosts; however, it does not mention any microorganisms here so we conclude they must be non-microorganism organisms being referred to as such because they aren't microscopic but rather macroscopic (i.e., easily visible by naked eye).

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.","target":"Pod","rationale":"The context mentions the album \\"Pod\\" and references its release date, popularity among fans of Deal and Donelly's other projects, as well as a sales record when compared to their next studio album.\\nIt also describes how the title was conceived after Deal saw artwork in Boston that depicted a uterus or womb. The cover art is discussed at length with details about how it was created by designer Vaughan Oliver through photography from Kevin Westenberg.\\nGiven this information from the text,  Pod seems like the most likely answer for what name of an album would be referenced in such detail."},{"source":"I have been a teacher for many years and so many of my students have done nice things for me…..they are just nice people.\\nI retired last year and was a substitute teacher this last school year.

Systemic arterial pressure, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt) and heart rate were comparable in the three animal groups. In the interval between 3 and 10 to 12 months, mean myocyte cell volume per nucleus increased 53 and 26% in the left and the right ventricle, respectively. The total number of myocyte nuclei remained constant in either ventricle. In the following period, between 10 to 12 and 19 to 21 months, a 39% further cellular hypertrophy on the left side of the heart was found in association with an 18% loss of cells in the ventricle. Cell loss was accompanied by discrete areas of interstitial and replacement fibrosis in the subendocardium. In contrast, no myocardial damage was observed in the right ventricle, and the measured 35% additional enlargement of myocytes occurred without a change in cell number. Thus, the aging left ventricle is composed of a smaller number of hypertrophied cells.

The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population.

However, most advancements have been made in static graph settings while efforts for jointly learning dynamic of the graph and dynamic on the graph are still in an infant stage. Two fundamental questions arise in learning over dynamic graphs: (i) How to elegantly model dynamical processes over graphs? (ii) How to leverage such a model to effectively encode evolving graph information into low-dimensional representations? We present DyRep - a novel modeling framework for dynamic graphs that posits representation learning as a latent mediation process bridging two observed processes namely -- dynamics of the network (realized as topological evolution) and dynamics on the network (realized as activities between nodes). Concretely, we propose a two-time scale deep temporal point process model that captures the interleaved dynamics of the observed processes. This model is further parameterized by a temporal-attentive representation network that encodes temporally evolving structural information into node representations which in turn drives the nonlinear evolution of the observed graph dynamics. Our unified framework is trained using an efficient unsupervised procedure and has capability to generalize over unseen nodes. We demonstrate that DyRep outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for dynamic link prediction and time prediction tasks and present extensive qualitative insights into our framework.","target":"Models Representation Learning over dynamic graphs as latent hidden process bridging two observed processes of Topological Evolution of and Interactions on dynamic graphs","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nModels Representation Learning over dynamic graphs as latent hidden process bridging two observed processes of Topological Evolution of and Interactions on dynamic graphs."},{"source":"DIALOG:\\nWhere was Wladyslaw Gomulka born?\\n- Władysław Gomułka was born in the Białobrzegi Franciszkańskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, Austria-Hungary.\\n- What did Wladyslaw Gomulka enjoy doing as a child?\\n- Throughout his life Władysław Gomułka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education.\\n- Where did Wladyslaw Gomulka attend school?\\n-","target":"Władysław Gomułka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop.","rationale":"The question is \\"Where did Wladyslaw Gomulka attend school?\\" and the correct answer is \\"Władysław Gomułka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop.\\" The other options are not relevant to this question."},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

We investigated this relationship using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP).Methods and Results:We enrolled 65 patients with SAP who underwent MDCT. Three monocyte subsets (CD14++CD16-, CD14++CD16+, and CD14+CD16+) and expression of TLR-4 were measured by flow cytometry. Intracoronary plaques were assessed by 64-slice MDCT. We defined vulnerability of intracoronary plaques according to the presence of positive remodeling (remodeling index >1.05) and/or low CT attenuation (<35 HU). The circulating CD14++CD16+monocytes more frequently expressed TLR-4 than CD14++CD16-and CD14+CD16+monocytes (P<0.001). The relative proportion of the expression of TLR-4 on CD14++CD16+monocytes was significantly greater in patients with vulnerable plaque compared with those without (10.4 [4.1-14.5] % vs. 4.5 [2.8-7.8] %, P=0.012). In addition, the relative proportion of TLR-4 expression on CD14++CD16+monocytes positively correlated with the remodeling index (r=0.28, P=0.025) and negatively correlated with CT attenuation value (r=-0.31, P=0.013).   \\n CONCLUSIONS Upregulation of TLR-4 on CD14++CD16+monocytes might be associated with coronary plaque vulnerability in patients with SAP.","target":"Association of Toll-Like Receptor 4 on Human Monocyte Subsets and Vulnerability Characteristics of Coronary Plaque as Assessed by 64-Slice Multidetector Computed Tomography","rationale":"In this study, the researchers investigated a possible relationship between TLR-4 expression on CD14++CD16+ monocytes and coronary plaque vulnerability (defined by positive remodeling and/or low CT attenuation) in patients with stable angina pectoris.

My mom is a single mother. I've grown up taking care of my sister and almost serving as a parent figure in her life. My cousin found her twitter I guess and saw that she had quoted something with the word \\"bitch\\" in it (it was like don't be a bitch, be happy or something along the lines of that), she screenshot it and let my mom know. My mom and I talked about it in private since she doesn't really understand Twitter and how it works. I told my mom that, yeah we should talk to her about being careful about what she says, especially on the internet but to not worry because when you're in middle school you think cussing makes you \\"cool\\". I reminded her that I did it as well on my \\"fan account\\" on twitter and that was she said wasn't even bad. My sister's account didn't have her picture or name on it, if that's an important factor. It wasn't an urgent matter so we didn't address it right away although we obviously planned to. Literally 2 hours after she texted my mom, my cousin decided it was her place to call my sister and lecture her over the phone. I was sitting next to her and could hear my cousin lecturing her and it made me absolutely furious. I told my sister to hand me the phone and I blew up. I started by saying \\"That's really not your place\\" and she started saying that we weren't dealing with it (IT'S NOT HER JOB TO HANDLE THE SITUATION ANYWAY). That made me even more angry and I told her that she wasn't her mom or her sister and that she needed to mind her own business. Notifying us was enough but it is absolutely NOT HER JOB to lecture my sister. She texted me a half-assed apology. Basically one of those \\"I'm sorry IF YOU FEEL blah blah blah\\" basically not taking responsibility or seeing anything wrong with her actions. I responded saying that it wasn't her place and that my mom and I had talked about it and she just went ahead and assumed that we weren't dealing with it and had the audacity to call my sister and lecture her. She responded saying that she was calm about lecturing my sister and that I had no reason to be mad (I beg to differ) and I responded with \\"It doesn't matter how you delivered it, it was wrong. Period. You were out of place. We talked to her about it and it felt like you were undermining not only me but my mom by calling her. You're not her parent.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

Meadows buys log books from scrapped models, then has other cars corresponding to the log books stolen and the number plates replaced. He gives a list of the latest batch to young petty thief Tommy Towers, which includes a 1959 Ford Anglia. The car Tommy steals belongs to struggling cosmetics salesman John Cummings, who needs the car to keep his job. Also, he did not insure the car against theft and becomes desperate to recover it. \\nPut onto Tommy by a street newspaper vendor, Alfie, who witnessed the crime, Cummings starts investigating the activities of Meadows and his associate Cliff. Meadows, disturbed by his inquiries, brutalizes Alfie, who then commits suicide.\\nDespite being warned off by both Meadows and the police, Cummings persists in his attempts to recover the car, even when his wife threatens to leave him and take the children away. It transpires that since his demob from the army, Cummings has failed at several enterprises, though his wife has always been supportive. Cummings eventually finds the weak link in Meadows's operation, his mistress Jackie, a teenage runaway whom, like Tommy, Meadows continually threatens and abuses.\\nTaking Jackie under his wing, Cummings sets out to prove that he is correct and that Meadows is a major criminal, stealing dozens of cars. He eventually convinces the police, but even then, they lack interest in helping him recover his car.

His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation.

These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line.

The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.\\n\\n- A bulletin board system, or BBS, is a computer server running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web, social networks and other aspects of the Internet. Low-cost, high-performance modems drove the use of online services and BBSes through the early 1990s. \\"Infoworld\\" estimated there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services like CompuServe.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'xmodem' with the relationship of 'instance of'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- airport\\n - base\\n - bulletin board system\\n - channel\\n - city\\n - collective\\n - communication\\n - communications protocol\\n - computer\\n - computer file\\n - country\\n - county\\n - county seat\\n - data\\n - device\\n - exchange\\n - factory\\n - february\\n - file\\n - four\\n - history\\n - information\\n - market\\n - message\\n - number\\n - ocean\\n - pen\\n - performance\\n - population\\n - river\\n - running\\n - seat\\n - set\\n - software\\n - state\\n - technology\\n - timeline\\n - tribe\\n - user\\n - variety\\n - ward","target":"communications protocol","rationale":"Xmodem is a protocol used to transfer files between different computing devices.

For example, the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared autonomy on 23 June 1917, created the Ukrainian People's Republic on 20 November, which was supported by the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. This led to an armed conflict with the Bolshevik government in Petrograd and, eventually, a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia on 25 January 1918. In Estonia, two rival governments emerged: the Estonian Provincial Assembly, established in April 1917, proclaimed itself the supreme legal authority of Estonia on 28 November 1917 and issued the Declaration of Independence on 24 February 1918. Soviet Russia recognized the Executive Committee of the Soviets of Estonia as the legal authority in the province, although the Soviets in Estonia controlled only the capital and a few other major towns.The success of the October Revolution transformed the Russian state into a soviet republic. A coalition of anti-Bolshevik groups attempted to unseat the new government in the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922. In an attempt to intervene in the civil war after the Bolsheviks' separate peace with the Central Powers, the Allied powers  occupied parts of the Soviet Union for over two years before finally withdrawing.

The same year, Salonga advertised the Avon Products line of anti-aging skin care products Anew Rejuvenate in the Philippines. In June 2009, she sang at the 95th Anniversary Special of the Iglesia Ni Cristo. Salonga sang Patriotic song \\"Bayan Ko\\" at the Requiem Mass for former President Corazon Aquino at Manila Cathedral. Salonga celebrated 20 years of Miss Saigon by performing in concerts called \\"Lea Salonga...Your Songs\\", at the Philippine International Convention Center Plenary Hall on December 11 and 12, 2009. Her brother, Gerard, was musical director.  From July to August 2010, Salonga played the role of Grizabella in the Manila run of the Asia-Pacific tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. In October, she played Fantine during the 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables, fifteen years after appearing in the 10th Anniversary as Eponine. The same year, she served as a celebrity judge for Avon Voices, Avon's first ever global, online singing talent search for women and songwriting competition for men and women.  Salonga was honored as a Disney Legend on August 19, 2011. She was one of the judges in the 60th Miss Universe 2011 Beauty Pageant in Sao Paulo, Brazil on 12 September 2011. Salonga, along with Darren Criss, sang \\"A Whole New World\\" to its composer, Alan Menken, as Menken was named the winner of the 2011 Maestro Award at the Billboard/Hollywood Reporter Film & TV Music Conference on October 24, 2011.  Salonga performed in a six-concert series titled \\"The Magic of Broadway and Disney Favorites\\" in 2012 with the Palm Beach Pops. She starred in the first production of Allegiance, at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego from September to October 2012. Salonga starred in the Philippine production of the comedy God of Carnage from July 2012 at the Carlos P. Romulo Auditorium, RCBC Plaza, Manila.

In a career spanning more than forty years, he has been a member of five successful rock bands: James Gang, Barnstorm, Eagles, the Party Boys, and Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In the 1990s, he was also a member of the short-lived supergroup the Best. Walsh has also experienced success both as a solo artist and prolific session musician, being featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings.\\n\\nWalsh is active in charity work and has performed in a number of concerts to raise money for charitable causes. He has also been a personal contributor to a number of charity causes including halfway houses for displaced adult women in Wichita, Kansas. Walsh funded the first talent-based scholarship at Kent State University in 2008.  Walsh's love of Santa Cruz Island grew into a lifelong commitment to conserve the environment there, and he has been active in preserving the island's parks. He is President of the Santa Cruz Island Foundation, and has served on the Foundation's board since the 1980s.  Walsh had often joked about running for office, announcing a mock presidential campaign in 1980 and a vice presidential campaign in 1992. Walsh ran for President of the United States in 1980, promising to make \\"Life's Been Good\\" the new national anthem if he won, and ran on a platform of \\"Free Gas For Everyone\\". Though Walsh was only 32 at the time of the election and thus would not have met the 35-year-old requirement to actually assume office, he said that he wanted to raise public awareness of the election. In 1992 Walsh ran for vice president with Rev. Goat Carson under the slogan \\"We Want Our Money Back!\\"  In an interview to promote his album Analog Man in 2012, Walsh revealed he was considering a serious bid for political office. \\"I think I would run seriously, and I think I would run for Congress,\\" Walsh told WASH in Washington, D.C. \\"The root of the problem is that Congress is so dysfunctional. We're dead in the water until Congress gets to work and passes some new legislation to change things.\\"  In 2017, Walsh contacted others in the music industry Zac Brown Band, Gary Clark Jr., Keith Urban to try to organize and perform what became VetsAid  - a concert series along the lines of the Farm Aid program spearheaded by country entertainer Willie Nelson.\\n\\nWhat sort of causes does he prefer?","target":"halfway houses for displaced adult women","rationale":"The context describes a number of charity causes that he is involved in, including halfway houses for displaced adult women.\\nShackleton"},{"source":"Answer the following question.\\nThraex, murmillo, and hoplomachus are types of?","target":"Lanistæ","rationale":"Thraex, murmillo, and hoplomachus were types of Roman gladiators.

In this work, we demonstrate that language understanding via a reading policy learner is a promising vehicle for generalisation to new environments. We propose a grounded policy learning problem, Read to Fight Monsters (RTFM), in which the agent must jointly reason over a language goal, relevant dynamics described in a document, and environment observations. We procedurally generate environment dynamics and corresponding language descriptions of the dynamics, such that agents must read to understand new environment dynamics instead of memorising any particular information. In addition, we propose txt2π, a model that captures three-way interactions between the goal, document, and observations. On RTFM, txt2π generalises to new environments with dynamics not seen during training via reading. Furthermore, our model outperforms baselines such as FiLM and language-conditioned CNNs on RTFM. Through curriculum learning, txt2π produces policies that excel on complex RTFM tasks requiring several reasoning and coreference steps.","target":"We show language understanding via reading is promising way to learn policies that generalise to new environments","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe show language understanding via reading is promising way to learn policies that generalise to new environments."},{"source":"You are given a password and you need to generate the number of steps required to convert the given password to a strong password.

It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers.\\n\\nA group of middle school students is measuring the temperature of various liquids for a chemistry lab using a mercury thermometer.

There are two types of friction: kinetic and static, which we will call \\"friction\\" in this problem. Kinetic friction occurs when an object moves across a surface while static friction holds objects at rest together. Friction increases as the area of contact decreases between two surfaces; thus, sand has more friction than concrete because it is smaller and rougher than concrete particles (sand vs gravel). Therefore, Marie's motorcycle tires heat up on the sand due to increased frictional resistance from riding over rough terrain with small grains rather than smooth pavement formed by larger pieces like rocks or gravel - there isn't much room for air pockets between each particle type so they stick together easier!

During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \\"Badami Chalukyas\\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas.

A broadway star by age 21, Le Gallienne consciously ended her work on Broadway to devote herself to founding the Civic Repertory Theater, in which she was both director, producer, and lead actress. Noted for her boldness and idealism, she became a pioneering figure in the American Repertory Movement, which enabled today's Off-Broadway. A versatile and eloquent actress herself (playing everything from \\"Peter Pan\\" to \\"Hamlet\\"), Le Gallienne also became a respected stage coach, director, producer and manager. Ms. Le Gallienne consciously devoted herself to the Art of the Theatre as opposed to the Show Business of Broadway and dedicated herself to upgrading the quality of the stage. She ran the Civic Repertory Theatre Company for 10 years (1926-1936), producing 37 plays during that time. She managed Broadway's 1100-seat Civic Repertory Theatre at 107 West 14th Street from 192632, which was home to her company whose actors included herself, Burgess Meredith, John Garfield, J.

Set in the Kingdom of Denmark, the play dramatises the revenge Prince Hamlet is called to wreak upon his uncle, Claudius, by the ghost of Hamlet's father, King Hamlet. Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the throne, also marrying his deceased brother's widow. \\"Hamlet\\" is Shakespeare's longest play, and is ranked among the most powerful and influential tragedies in English literature, with a story capable of \\"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\\". The play likely was one of Shakespeare's most popular works during his lifetime, and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879. It has inspired many other writers  from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch  and has been described as \\"the world's most filmed story after \\"Cinderella\\"\\".\\nThe story of Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his \\"Gesta Danorum\\", as subsequently retold by 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier (hypothetical) Elizabethan play known today as the \\"Ur-Hamlet\\", though some scholars believe he himself wrote the \\"Ur-Hamlet\\", later revising it to create the version of \\"Hamlet\\" we now have. He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time. In the 400 years since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century.\\n\\n- The Grey Fox is a 1982 Canadian biographical Western film directed by Phillip Borsos and written by John Hunter.

The film also features Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's parents.\\n\\n- The Straight Story is a 1999 internationally co-produced biographical road drama film directed by David Lynch. The film was edited and produced by Mary Sweeney, Lynch's longtime partner and co-worker. She co-wrote the script with John E. Roach. The film is based on the true story of Alvin Straight's 1994 journey across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawn mower. Alvin (Richard Farnsworth) is an elderly World War II veteran who lives with his daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), a kind woman with a mental disability. When he hears that his estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke, Alvin makes up his mind to go visit him and hopefully make amends before he dies. Because Alvin's legs and eyes are too impaired for him to receive a driving license, he hitches a trailer to his recently purchased thirty-year-old John Deere 110 Lawn Tractor, having a maximum speed of about 5 miles per hour, and sets off on the 240 mile journey from Laurens, Iowa to Mount Zion, Wisconsin.\\n\\n- The Pulitzer Prize for Drama is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year. (No Drama prize was given, however, so that one was inaugurated 1918 in a sense.) It recognizes a theatrical work staged in the U.S. during the preceding calendar year.\\n\\n- Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells.\\nFactors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\\nProstate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention.

He grew up in poverty in Depression-era New York City. In the early 1930s, he became a member of the Group Theater. In 1937, he moved to Hollywood, eventually becoming one of Warner Bros.' stars. Called to testify before the U.S. Congressional House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he denied communist affiliation and refused to \\"name names\\", effectively ending his film career. Some have alleged that the stress of this incident led to his premature death at 39 from a heart attack.

Five furlongs are about 1.0 kilometre (1.00584 km is the exact value, according to the international conversion).\\n\\n- The Flash Stakes was an important and prestigious race for two - year - old Thoroughbred horses and one of the longest running horse racing events in America . Run before races were graded , the Flash was won by a host of starry names . Begun before the United States Hotel Stakes ( also now removed from racing 's roster ) , it was the oldest race for juveniles of either gender in the US . Once a historic fixture in Saratoga , New York at the Saratoga Race Course , it was eliminated in 2005 by the New York Racing Association ( NYRA ) , which feared bankruptcy . Moved from its home in Saratoga after a long absence , the Grade III Flash had raced on at Belmont Park as a five furlong sprint on the main track for a $ 100,000 added purse until the NYRA 's 2005 decision .\\n\\n- Saratoga Race Course is a thoroughbred horse racing track in Saratoga Springs, New York, United States, with a capacity of 50,000. Opened in 1863, it is the third oldest racetrack in the US (after 2nd oldest Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack & oldest Freehold Raceway), though it is often considered to be the oldest sporting venue of any kind in the country.\\n\\n- The United States Hotel Stakes was an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually in the late summer or early autumn until 1955 at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York. It was run on dirt over a distance of six furlongs. Raced in the pre-grading era, for most of its existence the race was one of the premier shorter distance competitions for two-year-old horses in the United States.\\n\\n- The Thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing. Although the word \\"thoroughbred\\" is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed. Thoroughbreds are considered \\"hot-blooded\\" horses that are known for their agility, speed and spirit.\\n\\n- Saratoga Springs is a city in Saratoga County, New York, United States, that is also widely known as simply Saratoga (though not to be confused with the nearby town of that name). The population was 26,586 at the 2010 census. The name reflects the presence of mineral springs in the area, which has made Saratoga a popular resort destination for over 200 years. The city is just north of Albany in the heart of New York's Capital Region.\\n\\n- A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.\\n\\n- or \\"cultivars\\" of an animal species, achieved through the process of selective breeding.

At present, about one in five donors can provide a CBU with a sufficient TNC count for umbilical cord blood (UCB) banking. It is labor-intensive to obtain consent of all eligible donors and optimization of the selection is needed. The purpose of this study was to investigate prenatal clinical predictors for TNC count that would help to identify successful UCB donors already on admission to the delivery unit.', 'This study was a retrospective analysis of 758 cryopreserved CBUs, collected from 2002 to 2006. Maternal and fetal factors analyzed were maternal age, gravidity, parity, weight, height, diabetes, premature rupture of membranes, gestational age, fetal sex, and birthweight.

The hidden disorders and health dangers in waste dumps are often ignored. The waste generated in local communities is usually of a mixed type consisting of domestic waste and waste from small-scale industrial activities. Among these wastes are toxic metals, lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), halogenated organic compounds, plastics, remnants of paints that are themselves mixtures of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons and petroleum product-contaminated devices. Therefore, there is the urgent need to create an awareness of the harmful health effect of toxic wastes in developing countries, especially Nigeria.', 'This is a review aimed at creating awareness on the hidden dangers of waste dumps to health in local communities in developing countries.

Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing:\\nSome minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century.

At the age of 16 he appeared in Boy and Bicycle, a short film marking the directorial debut of his 23-year-old brother Ridley. Scott studied art in Leeds after failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Art in London at his first attempt.\\n\\nOn 19 August 2012, at approximately 12:30 pm.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house.

President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm.

Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

But daily tallies of new infections and fatalities have been steady in recent days, which experts hope points to a decline soon. Pressure is growing to find out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity, in order to soften the severe lockdown measures the government has imposed to curb the contagion. Franco Locatelli, the head of Italy’s Higher Health Council, said a reliable antibody testing system to use at the national level had still to be identified, though various products had already been proposed. Locatelli told reporters that government scientists were working hard to analyse the tests and hoped to have a result “in a few days”. He added that it would probably then take another month before the health authorities are able to roll out recommendations on a nationwide testing procedure. Some badly hit Italian regions have already started buying some of the tests already on the market. Speaking at the same news conference, health officials said the lockdown had prevented a potentially ruinous spread of the contagion from its northern epicentre to less developed southern regions. “The social distancing measures adopted on a national scale have meant that where the number of infections was relatively low, it remained low,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of infectious diseases at the national health institute. The government said this week that curbs on movement and business activities introduced nationwide on March 9 would stay in place until at least April 13.

The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was Kermes, made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes.

The boundary drawn up between the two nations was the Uruguay River, with Portugal possessing the land east of the river. The seven Jesuit missions east of the Uruguay River, known as the Misiones Orientales, were to be dismantled and relocated on the Spanish western side of the river. The seven missions were called San Miguel, Santos Angeles, San Lorenzo Martir, San Nicolas, San Juan Bautista, San Luis Gonzaga, and San Francisco de Borja. These missions were some of the most populous in South America with 26,362 inhabitants, according to a Jesuit census, and many more in the surrounding areas. In 1754 the Jesuits surrendered control of the missions, but the Guarani led by Sepé Tiaraju, refused to comply with the order to relocate. Efforts by the Spanish army in 1754 to forcefully remove the Guarani from the missions failed. On February 10, 1756, a combined force of 3,000 Spanish and Portuguese soldiers fought the Guaraní at the battle of Caiboaté. It resulted in the death of 1,511 Guarani, while the Europeans suffered only 4 deaths. In the aftermath of the battle, the joint Spanish-Portuguese army occupied the seven missions.

Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age.

One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter's skill in mathematics could lead her to become \\"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\\".  Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan:  I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar  Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts.

At the beginning, we didn’t play any stakes, just for fun. \\n\\nNow I don’t want to toot my horn or anything, but I know what I’m doing when I play poker. I’ve studied the statistics, game theory strategy, and played a lot online and live. I’m not like a god or anything but I really enjoy it and have put a decent amount of time into improving my play. \\n\\nSo when FakeName suggested put some skin in the game, I happily agreed. It wasn’t anything crazy, just whoever wins gets a drink from the loser. He won the first game, and we upped the prize pool to two drinks. We went back and forth like this for a few games (1 on 1 they lasted 10-20 minutes each). \\n\\nEventually I started to pull away. FakeName is very new to the game, and he was making all the amateur mistakes. He only bet when he felt good about his hand, and he called my bets way too much when he was “just hoping for that one card to come out!” He had some physical tells too- big eyes when his card came, fingering his chips when he just couldn’t wait to bet. In other words- very easy to exploit. \\n\\nThis is where I feel bad. Instead of stopping while I was marginally ahead (2-3 drinks), I said yes when he asked the chance to go double or nothing. I won. I said I was willing to let him go double or nothing until he won or we was ready to stop; before we know it, an hour has gone by and he’s down 40 drinks. Yeah, 40. That’s like $200 and waaay more than we should have been wagering given our stations in life. \\n\\nWhat makes it worse is that we had joked earlier that we were both the kind of people who couldn’t give up on a bad thing- that if we found ourselves in a hole we had the tendency to dig ourselves deeper trying to get out.

The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). In his first billing, as Louie Jordan's Elks Rendez-vous Band, his name was spelled Louie so people would know not to pronounce it Lewis.  The new band's first recording date, for Decca Records on December 20, 1938, produced three sides on which they backed an obscure vocalist, Rodney Sturgess, and two novelty sides of their own, \\"Honey in the Bee Ball\\" and \\"Barnacle Bill the Sailor\\". These recordings were credited to the Elks Rendezvous Band, but Jordan subsequently changed the name to the Tympany Five, since Martin often used tympani in performance. (The word tympany is also an old-fashioned colloquial term meaning \\"swollen, inflated, puffed-up\\", etymologically related to timpani, or kettledrums, but historically separate.)  The various lineups of the Tympany Five (which often featured two or three extra players) included Bill Jennings and Carl Hogan on guitar, the renowned pianist-arrangers Wild Bill Davis and Bill Doggett, \\"Shadow\\" Wilson and Chris Columbus on drums and Dallas Bartley on bass. Jordan played alto, tenor and baritone saxophone and sang the lead vocal on most songs.

Scott Fitzgerald, born on September 24, 1896, an American novelist, was once a student of St. Paul Academy, the Newman School and attended Princeton University for a short while. In 1917 he joined the army and was posted in Alabama, where he met his future wife Zelda Sayre. Then he had to make some money to impress her. \\nHis life with her was full of great happiness, as he wrote in his diary: \\"My own happiness in the past often approached such joy that I could not share it even with the person dearest to me but had to walk it away in quiet streets and take down parts of it in my diary.\\"\\nThis Side of Paradise, his first novel, was published in 1920. Encouraged by its success, Fitzgerald began to devote more time to his writing. Then he continued with the novel The Beautiful and Damned (1922), a collection of short storiesTales of the Jazz Age(1922), and a play The Vegetable (1923). But his greatest success wasThe Great Gatsby, published in 1925, which quickly brought him praise from the literary world. Yet it failed to give him the needed financial security. Then, in 1926, he published another collection of short storiesAll the Sad Young Men.\\nHowever, Fitzgerald's problems with his wife Zelda affected his writing. During the 1920s he tried to reorder his life, but failed. By 1930, his wife had her first mental breakdown and went to a Swiss clinic. During this period he completed novel Tender Is the Nightin 1934.While his wife was in hospital in the United States, he got totally addicted to alcohol. Fitzgerald died in 1940, before he could complete the novel The Love of the Last Tycoon.\\nQuestion: From the passage we can learn that   _  .\\nOptions: A: The Beautiful and Damnedwas Fitzgerald's first novel\\nB: the work The Great Gatsbybrought Fitzgerald great fame and fortune\\nC: Fitzgerald managed to recorder his life during the 1920s\\nD: Fitzgerald's wife broke down more than once","target":"D","rationale":"The passage mentions that Fitzgerald had problems with his wife Zelda which affected his writing.

For most microbes, the acidic, hydrolytically competent environment of the phagolysosome is sufficient to kill them. Despite our understanding of the trafficking events that regulate phagosome maturation, our appreciation of the lumenal environment within the phagosome is only now becoming elucidated through real-time functional assays. The assays quantify pH change, phagosome/lysosome fusion, proteolysis, lipolysis, and beta-galactosidase activity. This information is particularly important for understanding pathogens that successfully parasitize the endosomal/lysosomal continuum. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects macrophages through arresting the normal maturation process of the phagosome, retaining its vacuole at pH 6.4 with many of the characteristics of an early endosome. Current studies are focusing on the transcriptional response of the bacterium to the changing environment in the macrophage phagosome. Manipulation of these environmental cues, such as preventing the pH drop to pH 6.4 with concanamycin A, abrogates the majority of the transcriptional response in the bacterium, showing that pH is the dominant signal that the bacterium senses and responds to. These approaches represent our ongoing attempts to unravel the discourse that takes place between the pathogen and its host cell.","target":"False","rationale":"It provides general information about the role of macrophages in protecting host cells from microbial invasion.

Captain Antonio Corelli, an officer of the Italian 33rd Acqui Infantry Division, has a jovial personality and a passion for the mandolin, and trains his battery of men, (who have never fired a shot), to choral sing.

At first offended by the Italian soldier's behaviour, she slowly warms to Corelli's charm, and mandolin playing, as they are forced to share her father's home after the doctor agrees to put him up in exchange for medical supplies.\\nWhen Pelagia's fiance, Mandras, a local fisherman, heads off to war on the mainland, the friendship between Antonio and Pelagia grows. Her beauty and intelligence have captured Corelli's heart, and his fondness for the village's vibrant community has caused him to question his reasons for fighting. Corelli, and his battery of musical troops, becomes a part of the villagers' lives; but the moment is fleeting. As the war grows closer, Antonio and Pelagia are forced to choose between their allegiances and the love they feel for one another.\\nThe Italian government surrenders to the Allies, and the Italian troops happily prepare to return home. However, their erstwhile allies, the Germans, insist on disarming them, intemperately and violently. The Greeks are also exposed to the brutality of the incoming Germans, and arrange with the Italians to use their arms in a brief but futile resistance. For this, the German High Command has thousands of the Italian troops shot as traitors.

I'm obviously annoyed by this however I don't blame her: one of our relatives kids (8 years older than me) was SEVERELY addicted to them and she's always used him as an argument to why they're bad. Growing up I've only been able to play games over at friends' places without her knowing.\\n\\nAfter I started working a part time job, I started to save up money and about six months ago I bought myself a PS4 and a small monitor screen to hide in my bedroom with the money I had saved.

Playing games is something I would only do in my free time.\\n\\nLast week she found out about it while looking for something in my room while I was at school. She confiscated it straight away. When I found out I knew that I was in the wrong (I went behind her back) but I still wanted the PS4 back.

I feel like I've proven to her that I do have self control and she could stop worrying.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

Uterine flushings (UTF) and endometrium (ENDOM) from one uterine horn of nonpregnant and pregnant gilts (n = 9) were collected on days 10, 12, and 14 (n = 3). Protein, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.05), Na+, and K+ (P less than 0.01) increased linearly in UTF of pregnant gilts. Ca2+ changed biphasically, with higher concentrations (P less than 0.01) in pregnant gilts on day 12. Endometrial cAMP and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased between days 12 and 14 of pregnancy. The UTF norepinephrine (NE) concentrations increased (P less than 0.01) in cyclic gilts between days 12 and 14, while endometrial NE increased between days 10 and 12 and then decreased on day 14. The UTF of pregnant gilts had higher (P less than 0.05) concentrations of dopamine (DA), which peaked on day 12 and then decreased (P less than 0.01) by day 14. DA in UTF of nonpregnant gilts decreased between days 10 and 12 and remained low on day 14. A catecholamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, in ENDOM (P less than 0.05) and UTF (P less than 0.01) decreased linearly between days 10 and 14. The turnover rate of endometrial catecholamines was 2.4-fold higher (P less than 0.05) during early pregnancy compared with that in cyclic gilts. Effects of acute administration of exogenous E (0.5 mg) were also studied. The UTF and ENDOM were from day 11 nonpregnant gilts 0, 30, 60, and 360 min (n = 3) post-E or post-saline-ethanol (C) injection (n = 9). Potassium, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.01), and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased rapidly (30 min) after E injection. The K+ level changed biphasically, with increased concentrations again at 360 min. Plasmin inhibitor returned to levels similar to controls by 60 min, whereas cGMP remained elevated until 360 min postinjection when E, Ca2+, K+ (P less than 0.01), and Na+ (P less than 0.03) were increased. ENDOM NE (P less than 0.05) and UTF DA (P less than 0.05) were lower in E-treated gilts. Additionally, the turnover rate was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) for NE and DA in the UTF of E-treated gilts. An increase in Ca2+ in UTF preceded increases in protein secretions (except plasmin inhibitor) and may play a role in E-stimulated endometrial epithelial secretory vesicle exocytosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","target":"Effects of early pregnancy and acute 17 beta-estradiol administration on porcine uterine secretion, cyclic nucleotides, and catecholamines","rationale":"The abstract describes the effects of early pregnancy and acute 17 beta-estradiol administration on porcine uterine secretion, cyclic nucleotides, and catecholamines.

Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream...\\n\\nand the situation: Bobby and Sally are siblings that currently live in different cities. Bobby lives in a city that has wildfires on a regular basis.

Everything else is just Zara and H&M.\\" West also complimented Cudi by saying, \\"His writing is just so pure and natural and important.\\" In March 2014, Cudi talked about wanting to provide guidance for young listeners with his music: \\"my mission statement since day one [...] all I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone, and stop committing suicide.\\"  In a 2013 article for The BoomBox, the author wrote: \\"On [A Kid Named Cudi], Cudi raps and croons over samples and interpolations of Gnarls Barkley, Paul Simon, Band of Horses, J Dilla, Nosaj Thing, N.E.R.D. and Outkast. He melded indie rock, electronica and dubstep seamlessly with hip-hop without pandering or reaching. Before Drake broke through with 2009's So Far Gone, rapping and singing over Swedish indie poppers Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John, Cudi tweaked with multi-genre covers and seamless transitions between singing and rapping.\\" In a 2009 interview with HipHopDX, when speaking on his debut album Cudi stated: \\"Well one thing I wanted to do was combine sounds that really bring out intense moods.\\"  Kid Cudi's music has also been described as trip hop. Furthermore, he is known for harmonizing and humming in his music, which helps formulate his signature sound. On 2011's WZRD and 2015's Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven, Cudi incorporated the use of screamed vocals, and can be heard yodeling on his 2016 album Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin'.

Later that month, Gorbachev resigned as general secretary of the Communist party, and Russian president Boris Yeltsin ordered the seizure of Soviet property. Gorbachev clung to power as the President of the Soviet Union until December 1991, when the Soviet Union dissolved.

Bush and Yeltsin met in February 1992, declaring a new era of \\"friendship and partnership\\". In January 1993, Bush and Yeltsin agreed to START II, which provided for further nuclear arms reductions on top of the original START treaty. The collapse of the Soviet Union prompted reflections on the future of the world following the end of the Cold War; one political scientist, Francis Fukuyama, speculated that humanity had reached the \\"end of history\\" in that liberal, capitalist democracy had permanently triumphed over Communism and fascism.

Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) is known for its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1 Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively.

With 3:33 remaining in the quarter, Browns quarterback Charlie Frye connected on a 40-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow. That put the Browns on the Atlanta 6-yard line and 3 plays later, on 4th and 1, the Browns scored on a run by running back Reuben Droughns and the Browns took a 7-0 lead.

It took two plays for Vick to connect with wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a touchdown. The score was then 14-10. The possibility of success seemed unlikely for the Browns in the fourth quarter. After the teams each went three and out, Atlanta gained favorable field position and were able to bring Andersen in for a 46-yard field goal.  At that point the Browns were leading 14-13.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.\\nThe young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

Some manufacturers, for example Minolta, Canon and Nikon, chose to make their DSLRs 100% compatible with their existing SLR lenses in the beginning, allowing owners of new DSLRs to continue to use their existing lenses and get a longer lifespan from their investment. Others, for example Olympus, chose to create a completely new lens mount and series of lenses for their DSLRs. The Pentax SLR camera K-mount system is backward compatible to all previous lens generations from Pentax, including the latest digital SLRs like the K-3 and K-50. A Pentax K-mount lens from the early 70s can be used on the newest Pentax DSLR although it may not provide features that are included in newer lenses (e.g. autofocus). There are a few exceptions from the MZ and ZX series of Pentax film cameras that do not work with some of the older lenses.\\nQuestion: do all dslr lenses fit all dslr cameras?","target":"No","rationale":"The document mentions that DSLRs are available through multiple camera manufacturers, and each manufacturer offers its own line of lenses.

A good friend can help you study. You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends.

I look for certain qualities  of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability .\\nAbove all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener.\\nAt the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults  in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me.\\nAnother quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me.

We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like.

After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\".\\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\nQuestion: Of the 2,900 prisoners, who will be released? \\nIs the correct answer Spies?","target":"No","rationale":"The article states that only prisoners who have served \\"an important\\" part of their sentence and exhibited good behavior will be released.

Our previous data shows that electroporation-mediated transfer of plasmid DNA to peripheral muscle enhances gene transduction dramatically. This study was designed to investigate the effect of electroporation-mediated overexpression of hIL-10 on acute rejection of cardiac allografts in the rat.', 'The study was designed to evaluate the effect of hIL-10 gene transfer on (a) early rejection pattern and (b) graft survival. Gene transfer was achieved by intramuscular (i.m.) injection into the tibialis anterior muscle of Fischer (F344) male recipients followed by electroporation 24 h prior to transplantation. Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed from male Brown Norway rat to F344. Four groups were studied (n = 6). Treated animals in groups B1 and B2 received 2.5 microg of pCIK hIL-10 and control animals in groups A1 and A2 distilled water. Graft function was assessed by daily palpation. Animals from group A1 were sacrificed at the cessation of the heart beat of the graft and those in group B1 were sacrificed at day 7; blood was taken for ELISA measurement of hIL-10 and tissue for myeloperoxidase (MPO) measurement and histological assessment. To evaluate graft survival, groups A2 and B2 were sacrificed at cessation of the heart beat of the graft.', 'Histological examination revealed severe rejection (IIIB-IV) in group A1 in contrast to low to moderate rejection (IA-IIIA) in group B1 (p = 0.02). MPO activity was significantly lower in group B1 compared to group A1 (18 +/- 7 vs. 32 +/- 14 mU/mg protein, p = 0.05). Serum hIL-10 levels were 46 +/- 13 pg/ml in group B1 vs. 0 pg/ml in group A1.

Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro.

Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens.  Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room.

Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow  accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course.

As the truck raced past, Ishikawa heard her son call out to her grandson, telling the boy to evacuate to higher ground. Then he was gone. She is haunted by what happened and tormented by what might have been. “I blame myself over and over again, asking myself why I didn’t stop him,” said Ishikawa, 65, as she sat in the spartan shelter where she has lived since that day. Small towns across Japan’s northeastern coast are rebuilding but far from healing three years since a massive earthquake set off a tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people. In Rikuzentakata, where one in 10 residents died, nearly everyone lost a friend or family member on March 11, 2011. The resilience of Rikuzentakata’s tsunami survivors was embodied by a lone surviving tree, dubbed the “miracle pine”. But the tree died last year and a replica stands in its place. Around 5,000 people, a quarter of the town’s population, are still in temporary shelters with their lives on hold. Many like Ishikawa have chosen to suffer alone rather than seek support. Ishikawa’s voice cracked as she described how her husband placed a scarf around their son’s neck when they found him in a makeshift morgue. “He looked so cold,” she said. After finding him, she went back to the rubble to search for the bodies of her mother and younger brother. There were days in the wake of the disaster when her mind was completely blank, Ishikawa said. Then her blood pressure spiked and she was taken to a hospital. Her doctor urged her to see a counselor but she declined. “No stranger can understand what is in my heart. I must bear this alone,” she said, tears running down her face. Survivors can find it especially difficult to seek help in a country that still stigmatizes mental illness and prizes stoicism, experts say. “Japanese hesitate to use mental health support - not only mental health support, but support in general,” said Tsuyoshi Akiyama, the chairman of the disaster support committee set up by the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology. Most of the debris has been cleared in Rikuzentakata, leaving only an overgrown field where the town once stood. Dump trucks and bulldozers barrel down the town’s few paved roads, sending clouds of yellow dust into the air. After sunset, there is only silence. Some residents say they believe in ghosts and a few taxi drivers say they refuse to pick up passengers after dark after some claimed to have seen apparitions. The sound of the ocean is faint, and many survivors say they avoid the seaside at night. Mental health professionals say resentment has also built among the survivors because some have managed to get their lives back on track faster than others. “In the first year, there is a collective feeling of working together, of overcoming this together,” said Ayako Sato, a psychologist hired by the Rikuzentakata city board. “In the second year, everyone wants to help each other because everyone suffered a loss in the disaster. But by the third year, you start to see a rift in living standards. People drift apart,” Sato said. Takeshi Kanno, 63, is a pillar of the Rikuzentakata village of Kesencho, which lost all of its homes to the disaster. While Kanno built a relief camp at the Buddhist temple above the town, his youngest son, a volunteer firefighter, searched for bodies in the debris below. “He was young and reliable and everyone depended on him. This became a massive burden,” said Kanno. “He didn’t sleep and collapsed from exhaustion.”  Kanno’s son has since been hospitalized and has not spoken or left his room in nearly a year, he said. A photo of his 28-year-old son hangs on the wall of the log cabin Kanno built after the disaster. The photo, taken in 2012, shows a young, slender man smiling as villagers line up before a drum performance. Some of that sense of community has disappeared, Kanno said. There are no comprehensive statistics on the depth of the tsunami’s psychological impact on survivors. Rikuzentakata’s city hall so far counts three disaster-related suicides. A study funded by Japan’s health ministry found that more than a quarter of children aged between 3 and 5 in the disaster zone exhibited signs of distress that needed professional help. Some daycare centers don’t celebrate Mother’s Day or Father’s Day anymore because so many children lost at least one parent. Rikuzentakata mayor Futoshi Toba lost his wife in the tsunami. He says the city must do what it can to help its residents heal as it rebuilds. “There are people who feel better when they speak to someone, and then there are those who feel more traumatized when they remember the past,” Toba said. “What we have to do is to keep rebuilding and share the town’s progress with the residents to keep up hope.” Claim: Japan's tsunami survivors suffer in silence three years after disaster.","target":"2","rationale":"The overwhelming evidence in the paragraph suggests that the survivors are still struggling to rebuild and recover from the disaster, but it also presents examples of resilience and hope. The sentence \\"There are people who feel better when they speak to someone, and then there are those who feel more traumatized when they remember the past\\" indicates that some survivors have found support by seeking help while others have tried to deal with their problems on their own. So, while there is evidence both supporting and contradicting this claim, as a whole this paragraph presents an overall picture of recovery (rather than \\"silence\\") so option 2 is correct."},{"source":"In this task, you will be shown an English sentence.

Scandinavian influence was dominant in the northern and western islands, Brythonic culture in the southwest, the Anglo-Saxon or English Kingdom of Northumbria in the southeast and the Pictish and Gaelic Kingdom of Alba in the east, north of the River Forth. By the tenth and eleventh centuries, northern Great Britain was increasingly dominated by Gaelic culture, and by the Gaelic regal lordship of Alba, known in Latin as either Albania or Scotia, and in English as \\"Scotland\\". From its base in the east, this kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the south and ultimately the west and much of the north. It had a flourishing culture, comprising part of the larger Gaelic-speaking world and an economy dominated by agriculture and trade.\\nAfter the twelfth-century reign of King David I, the Scottish monarchs are better described as Scoto-Norman than Gaelic, preferring French culture to native Scottish culture. A consequence was the spread of French institutions and social values including Canon law. The first towns, called burghs, appeared in the same era, and as they spread, so did the Middle English language. These developments were offset by the acquisition of the Norse-Gaelic west and the Gaelicisation of many of the noble families of French and Anglo-French origin. National cohesion was fostered with the creation of various unique religious and cultural practices. By the end of the period, Scotland experienced a \\"Gaelic revival\\", which created an integrated Scottish national identity. By 1286, these economic, institutional, cultural, religious and legal developments had brought Scotland closer to its neighbours in England and the Continent, although outsiders continued to view Scotland as...","target":"Gaelic Kingdom of Alba","rationale":"The paragraph describes the culture and economy of a kingdom in Scotland.

He grew up in Charlestown, across the Connecticut River from Bellows Falls, and attended Charlestown High School, where he played baseball and basketball. Because his family is from New Hampshire, he insisted that the organization remove from his plaque in the Red Sox Hall of Fame its characterization of him as a Vermont native. Fisk earned his longtime nickname, \\"Pudge\\", because he was a chubby youngster.\\n\\nFisk was known for his longstanding feud with New York Yankees catcher Thurman Munson. One particular incident that typified their feud, and the Yankees - Red Sox rivalry in general, occurred on August 1, 1973, at Fenway Park. With the score 2-2 in the top of the ninth inning, Munson, attempting to score on Gene Michael's missed bunt attempt, barreled into Fisk, triggering a 10-minute bench-clearing brawl in which both catchers were ejected. As John Curtis let his first pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed. With Munson coming, the scrawny Yankees shortstop tried to step in Fisk's way, but Fisk elbowed him out of the way and braced for Munson, who crashed into him as hard as he could. Fisk held onto the ball, but Munson tried to lie on top of him to allow Felipe Alou to keep rounding the bases.  Fisk kicked Munson off him and into the air, and swiped at him with his fist. Michael grabbed Fisk, and as Curtis grabbed Munson--his former Cape Cod League roommate--Fisk threw Michael down with his left arm and fell to the ground. \\"Fisk had his left arm right across Stick's throat and wouldn't let up\\", said Ralph Houk, the Yankees' manager at the time. \\"Michael couldn't breathe. I had to crawl underneath the pile to try to pry Fisk's arm off his throat to keep him from killing Stick. All the while he had Michael pinned down, he was punching Munson underneath the pile. I had no idea Fisk was that strong, but he was scary.\\"  In another incident typifying the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, Fisk was involved in an altercation with Lou Piniella during a May 20, 1976, game at Yankee Stadium. In the sixth inning of this game, Piniella barreled into Fisk trying to score on an Otto Velez single. Fisk and Piniella shoved each other at home plate, triggering another bench-clearing brawl. After order appeared to be restored, Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee and Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles began exchanging words and punches, igniting the brawl anew. Lee suffered a separated left shoulder in the altercation and missed much of the season.  In an incident on May 22, 1990, NFL and MLB player Deion Sanders, then with the Yankees, hit a pop fly, and declined to run to first base, suspecting that the ball would be easily caught. Fisk yelled at Sanders to run the ball out and told Sanders during his next at-bat, \\"There is a right way and a wrong way to play this game. You're playing it the wrong way.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.\\n\\nParagraph: Two engineering students learned about petroleum products, While Dan learned more about plastics, Jim learned about fuels.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned less about fuels for airplanes?","target":"Dan","rationale":"The paragraph indicates that Dan studied plastics and Jim studied fuels.

Thus, given the context provided in this question, Dan would have learned less about fuels for airplanes because he was focused on learning more about plastic and its uses instead of learning how to make jet fuel out of refined crude oil."},{"source":"You are given a sentence from a conversation between a human and a virtual assistant.
