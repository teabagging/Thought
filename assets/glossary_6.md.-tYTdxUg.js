In the case of females, however, the gametes are eggs, and they are produced by the ovaries. The hormone is estrogen, which is the main sex hormone in females. Estrogen has two major roles: During adolescence, estrogen causes the changes of puberty. It causes the reproductive organs to mature. It also causes other female traits to develop. For example, it causes the breasts to grow and the hips to widen. During adulthood, estrogen is needed for a woman to release eggs from the ovaries. The female reproductive system has another important function, which is not found in males. It supports a baby as it develops before birth. It also gives birth to the baby at the end of pregnancy. The female reproductive organs include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. These organs are shown in Figure 22.3, along with some other structures of the female reproductive system. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it below. For a cartoon about the female reproductive system, watch this video: [Link] The two ovaries are small, oval organs on either side of the abdomen. Each ovary contains thousands of eggs. However, the eggs do not develop fully until a female has gone through puberty. Then, about once a month, an egg is released by one of the ovaries. The ovaries also secrete estrogen. The two fallopian tubes are thin tubes that are connected to the uterus and extend almost to the ovaries. The upper end of each fallopian tube has fingers (called fimbriae) that sweep an egg into the fallopian tube when it is released by the ovary. The egg then passes through the fallopian tube to the uterus. If an egg is fertilized, this occurs in the fallopian tube. The uterus is a hollow organ with muscular walls. The uterus is where a baby develops until birth. The walls of the uterus stretch to accommodate the growing fetus. The muscles in the walls contract to push the baby out during birth. The uterus is connected to the vagina by a small opening called the cervix. The vagina is a cylinder-shaped organ that opens to the outside of the body. The other end joins with the uterus. Sperm deposited in the vagina swim up through the cervix, into the uterus, and from there into a When a baby girl is born, her ovaries contain all of the eggs they will ever produce. But these eggs are not fully developed. They develop only after the female reaches puberty at about age 12 or 13. Then, just one egg develops each month until she reaches her 40s or early 50s. Human eggs are very large cells. In fact, they are the largest of all human cells. You can even see an egg without a microscope. Its almost as big as the period at the end of this sentence. Like a sperm cell, an egg cell is a haploid cell with half the number of chromosomes of other cells in the body. Unlike a sperm cell, the egg lacks a tail and contains a lot of cytoplasm. Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It occurs in several steps: 1. Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through mitosis to make identical daughter cells. 2. The daughter cells then start to divide by meiosis. However, they go though only the first of the two cell divisions of meiosis at this time. They remain in that stage until the girl goes through puberty. 3. After puberty, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month. As you can see in Figure 22.4, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle. The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other changes. 4.

In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. \\n\\n- A diminutive is a word which has been modified to convey a slighter degree of its root meaning, to convey the smallness of the object or quality named, or to convey a sense of intimacy or endearment. A (abbreviated ) is a word-formation device used to express such meanings; in many languages, such forms can be translated as \\"little\\" and diminutives can also be formed as multi-word constructions such as \\"Tiny Tim\\". Diminutives are used frequently when speaking to small children or when expressing extreme tenderness and intimacy to an adult. As such, they are often employed for nicknames and pet names. The opposite of the diminutive form is the augmentative.\\n\\n- Julien Louis Geoffroy (17 August 1743  27 February 1814) was a French literary critic.\\n\\n- Condé Nast (stylized as CONDÉ NAST) is an American mass media company founded in 1909 by Condé Montrose Nast, based at One World Trade Center and owned by Advance Publications.

Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.\\n\\n- A cartoon is a type of two-dimensional illustration. While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to (a) a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic artistic style of drawing or painting, (b) an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor, or (c) a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. An artist who creates cartoons is called a cartoonist.\\n\\n- Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.\\n\\n- Oral literature or folk literature corresponds in the sphere of the spoken (oral) word to literature as literature operates in the domain of the written word. \\n\\n- Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). \\nThe two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.\\n\\n- In linguistics, a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \\"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\\"), or several (\\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are \\"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\\").\\nA complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (\\"rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed\\"), or more than one root in a compound (\\"black-board, rat-race\\"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (\\"a red rock\\"), clauses (\\"I threw a rock\\"), and sentences (\\"He threw a rock too, but he missed\\").\\n\\n- The French Revolution was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.\\n\\n- A critic is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.\\n\\n- Feuilleton ( French pronunciation :  ( fœjt ) ; a diminutive of French : feuillet , the leaf of a book ) was originally a kind of supplement attached to the political portion of French newspapers , consisting chiefly of non-political news and gossip , literature and art criticism , a chronicle of the latest fashions , and epigrams , charades and other literary trifles . The term feuilleton was invented by Julien Louis Geoffroy and Bertin the Elder , editors of the French Journal des débats in 1800 . The feuilleton may be described as a \`\` talk of the town '' , and a contemporary English - language example of the form is the \`\` Talk of the Town '' section of The New Yorker . In English newspapers , the term \`\` feuilleton '' instead came to refer to an installment of a serial story printed in one part of a newspaper . The genre of the feuilleton in its French sense was eventually included in English newspapers , but was not referred to as a feuilleton . In contemporary French , feuilleton has taken on the meaning \`\` soap opera '' . German and Polish newspapers still use the term for their literary and arts sections .\\n\\n- The Journal des débats (French for: Journal of Debates) was a French newspaper, published between 1789 and 1944 that changed title several times. Created shortly after the first meeting of the Estates-General of 1789, it was, after the outbreak of the French Revolution, the exact record of the debates of the National Assembly, under the title \\"Journal des Débats et des Décrets\\" (\\"Journal of Debates and Decrees\\").\\n\\n- Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\\n\\n- Art criticism is the discussion or evaluation of visual art. Art critics usually criticise art in the context of aesthetics or the theory of beauty. A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.\\n\\n- The New Yorker is an American magazine of reportage, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. It is published by Condé Nast. Started as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans.\\n\\n- Aesthetics (also spelled æsthetics and esthetics also known in Greek as , or \\"\\"Aisthtiké\\"\\") is a branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of art, beauty, and taste, with the creation and appreciation of beauty. It is more scientifically defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgements of sentiment and taste. More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as \\"critical reflection on art, culture and nature\\". In modern English, the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the Cubist aesthetic.\\n\\n- Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.\\n\\n- A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.\\n\\n- Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") \\n\\n- A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.\\n\\n- A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. \\n\\n- An art critic is a person who is specialized in analyzing, interpreting and evaluating art. Their written critiques or reviews contribute to art criticism and they are published in newspapers, magazines, books, exhibition brochures and catalogues and on web sites. Some of today's art critics use art blogs and other online platforms in order to connect with a wider audience and expand debate about art.\\n\\n- The Estates-General (or States-General) of 1789 was the first meeting since 1614 of the French Estates-General, a general assembly representing the French estates of the realm: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate). Summoned by King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his government's financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse over the first item on the agenda: whether they should vote by estate, giving the first two estates an advantage, which was the King's choice, or vote all together, giving the Third Estate the advantage. It was brought to an end when the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, inviting the other two to join, against the wishes of the King. This signals the outbreak of the French Revolution.\\n\\n- Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'feuilleton' and 'satire'?","target":"genre","rationale":"Feuilleton is a genre and satire is a type of writing within that genre.\\nSo the answer is \\"genre\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you are given two sets, and you need to count the number of elements at the intersection of two given sets.

According to various organizations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, and other sources), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820: von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut). The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km (20 mi) from Queen Maud's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S 2°14′50″W\uFEFF / \uFEFF69.35778°S 2.24722°W\uFEFF / -69.35778; -2.24722, which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf.

The Broncos grabbed the lead on the game's opening drive, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas. The Chiefs got on the scoreboard later in the first quarter, with a 45-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos, then took the lead early in the second quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown run by running back Knile Davis. The Broncos re-claimed the lead on their next offensive possession, with Manning connecting on a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jacob Tamme, then added to their lead just before halftime, with a 12-yard touchdown pass from Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. The Chiefs got the opening possession of the second half, with a time-consuming drive that took them to as far as the Broncos' 4-yard line, but were backed up 10 yards by an offensive holding penalty and a 5-yard sack of quarterback Alex Smith by Broncos' linebacker Brandon Marshall. Santos subsequently missed a 37-yard field goal to end a drive that chewed up the first 10 minutes of the third quarter. The Broncos were forced to punt on their next possession, and the Chiefs narrowed the Broncos' lead to 21-17 midway through the fourth quarter with another time-consuming drive, culminating with a 4-yard touchdown run by Davis. The Broncos drove down the field on their next possession, but had to settle on a 20-yard field by placekicker Brandon McManus to extend their lead to 24-17 with 3:30 remaining in the fourth quarter. Three plays into the Chiefs' next possession, Smith was intercepted by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib, who returned the football 41 yards for a touchdown; however, the interception return was nullified by an offside penalty on defensive end Quanterus Smith. The Chiefs' earned one first down prior to the two-minute warning. On the second play after the two-minute warning, Broncos' defensive end DeMarcus Ware forced a fumble off Smith; however, it was ruled an incomplete pass following a replay review. On the next play, Smith connected on a 21-yard pass to wide receiver Dwayne Bowe, and was pushed out of bounds at the Broncos' 9-yard line by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. with 1:51 remaining in the game. Three plays later, after burning their last timeout, the Chiefs were facing a 3rd-and-goal at the Broncos' 4-yard line; however, an offside call against Ware moved the ball half the distance to the goal line, with 1:04 remaining in the game. Davis subsequently attempted a run up the middle, but was tackled for no gain at the 2-yard line by Ware and linebacker Nate Irving. On the Chiefs' final offensive play, Smith's pass intended for Bowe on 4th-and-goal was broken up by Broncos' defensive tackle Terrance Knighton.

Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians.\\nAlkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.\\nFollowing his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...","target":"Élie-Miriam Delaborde","rationale":"The name Élie-Miriam Delaborde is the full name of Charles Valentin Alkan’s presumed son, which matches perfectly with the question.

That means having a glass of wine at dinner might make a person drunk, a spokesman for the Tavern League of Wisconsin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the same day. Under a BAC standard of 0.05, a person could get nailed for DUI after one drink? Tavern League’s evidence The statement was made by Scott Stenger, a Madison lobbyist whose clients include the tavern league. He told us he based his claim on news articles about the 0.05 recommendation, including a report from the Journal Sentinel and The Associated Press, and a chart on blood-alcohol concentration from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. The news covered the recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates transportation accidents and makes recommendations based on its findings. The board said states should cut the current blood-alcohol level for evidence of intoxication as part of a series of ideas aimed at reducing alcohol-related highway deaths. In its report, the Associated Press said 0.05 is \\"\\"about one drink for a woman weighing less than 120 pounds,\\"\\" and that a drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of 80-proof alcohol \\"\\"in most studies.\\"\\" Meanwhile, the Texas agency chart that Stenger cited says its BAC data comes from another federal body, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which works to prevent highway crashes. That data says essentially what Stenger and AP did: A 100-pound woman could reach 0.05 after one drink. (Incidentally, both the AP and the chart used by the Texas agency said a 160-pound man could reach 0.05 after consuming two drinks in one hour.) So, there’s evidence that a limited group of drinkers -- women weighing under 120 pounds -- could be legally drunk after one drink, if the standard for drunken driving were reduced to a blood-alcohol level of 0.05. What other evidence is out there? BAC calculators We checked three online calculators that provide blood-alcohol concentration estimates based on various factors, including gender and weight. They generally found a BAC of less than 0.05 for a 100-pound woman consuming one drink. The calculator at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (which also has a smartphone app), says the BAC would be 0.03. A more detailed calculator from the University of Notre Dame’s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.04 for a 5-ounce glass of wine, if the wine is red and 12.5 percent alcohol. And the calculator at Central Connecticut State University’s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.05 after a 5-ounce glass of table wine. So, why do the blood-alcohol concentration figures vary? Well, as we noted, all of the figures are estimates. The Wisconsin DOT also points out that besides gender, weight and the amount of alcohol consumed, other factors are in play. Your BAC will be higher if you drink faster or drink on an empty stomach. Women reach higher BACs faster because they have less water in their bodies and more adipose tissue (fat), which is not easily penetrated by alcohol. Jan Grebel, a chemical test supervisor for the DOT, told us about another factor: If you drink frequently, your liver can break down alcohol more efficiently, but if you don’t, your BAC would be higher after even one drink. Grebel quoted to us from a chart she utilizes when testifying in court in drunken driving cases. She said the chart estimates the BAC at 0.047 -- nearly 0.05 -- for a 100-pound woman after one drink. But Grebel said that would be the maximum BAC in that instance. Most people would not reach 0.05 after one drink, she said. Our rating The Tavern League of Wisconsin said a proposal to make 0.05 the standard for drunken driving would mean that having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk. The statement is accurate, in that it’s possible an individual could reach 0.05 after one drink. But it needs additional information, namely that the situation would apply only in a small number of instances and would depend on other factors, such as drinking on an empty stomach.\\" Claim: A 0.05 standard for drunken driving means having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk.","target":"2","rationale":"In the paragraph, the claim is given a rating of TRUE and the evidence provided in its support is discussed.

He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from his final ball in his last Test match. Muralitharan holds the world record for the most wickets in both test and one-day cricket.\\nContext: In May 2004, Muralitharan overtook West Indian Courtney Walsh's record of 519 Test match wickets to become the highest wicket-taker. Zimbabwe's Mluleki Nkala becomes Muralitharan's 520th scalp in Tests. Muralitharan held the record until Shane Warne claimed it in October 2004. Warne surpassed Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan's mark of 532 wickets by dismissing India's Irfan Pathan. Warne said he enjoyed his duel with Muralitharan, who was sidelined following shoulder surgery at the time.  After an outstanding year Muralitharan was adjudged as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2006. In six Tests, he took 60 wickets. He took ten in each of four successive matches, the second time he performed such a feat. The opponents for his 60-wicket haul were England away, South Africa at home and New Zealand away: serious opposition. In all, Muralitharan took 90 wickets in 11 Tests in the calendar year.  In July 2007, Muttiah Muralitharan became the second bowler after Australia's Shane Warne to capture 700 Test wickets. The off-spinner reached the landmark when he had Bangladesh's last man Syed Rasel caught in the deep by Farveez Maharoof on the fourth day of the third and final Test at the Asgiriya stadium in Kandy. The dismissal signalled Sri Lanka's victory by an innings and 193 runs to give the host a 3-0 sweep of the series. Muralitharan finished with six wickets in each innings to claim 10 wickets or more in a Test for the 20th time. However, he was unable to pass Warne's record of 708 wickets when Sri Lanka toured Australia in November 2007, capturing just four wickets in two Test matches.  Muralitharan reclaimed the record for most Test wickets during the first Test against England at Kandy on 3 December 2007. The spinner bowled England's Paul Collingwood to claim his 709th Test victim and overtaking Shane Warne in the process. Muralitharan reached the mark in his 116th Test - 29 fewer than Warne - and had conceded only 21.77 runs per wicket compared to the Australian's 25.41. This was Muralitharan's 61st 5-wicket haul. Warne believed that Muralitharan would take \\"1,000 wickets\\" before he retired. Former record holder Courtney Walsh also opined that this would be possible if Muralitharan retained his hunger for wickets. Muralitharan himself believed there was a possibility that he would reach this milestone.  An aggressive lower order batsman who usually batted at No. 11, Muralitharan was known for his tendency to back away to leg and slog. Sometimes, he could be troublesome for bowlers because of his unorthodox and adventurous ways. Once, in a Test match against England, while playing Alex Tudor, he moved back towards his leg stump trying to hook the ball and ended up lying on the ground sideways after the shot. He was infamously run out in a match against New Zealand when he left his crease to congratulate Kumar Sangakkara, who had just scored a single to reach his century; the New Zealand fielder had not yet returned the ball to the wicketkeeper, so the ball was still in play. His highest Test score of 67 came against India at Kandy in 2001, including three sixes and five fours. He made valuable scores on occasion, including 30 runs against England at the Oval in 1998, including 5 fours, 38 runs (4 fours, 1 six) against England at Galle in 2003, 43 runs (5 fours, 3 sixes) against Australia at Kandy in 2004 36 runs against the West Indies at Colombo in 2005, and his highest-ever ODI score, 33 not out (4 fours and 2 sixes off 16 balls) against Bangladesh in the final of the 2009 Tri-Series in Bangladesh. In the latter match, Muralitharan's effort, which included three fours and a six off one over, played a key role in Sri Lanka winning the match and series after the first eight overs saw them reduced to 6 for 5, the lowest score ever recorded in an ODI at the fall of the fifth wicket. Muralitharan has a strike rate close to 70 in Test cricket and scored over 55% of his Test runs in fours and sixes.  Muralitharan, together with Chaminda Vaas, holds the record for the highest 10th wicket partnership in Tests for Sri Lanka. The pair put on 79 runs for the last wicket at the Asgiriya Stadium against Australia in March 2004. Muralitharan also holds the record for scoring most runs in Test cricket while batting at the number 11 position.  Muralitharan currently holds the record for the most ducks (dismissals for zero) ever in international cricket (Tests, ODI's and Twenty20), with a total of 59 ducks.  Muralitharan voiced his frustration at routinely being heckled by Australian crowds who accuse him of throwing - one common jeer directed at him was \\"No Ball!\\". Following the then Australian Prime Minister John Howard's statement that Muralitharan was a \\"chucker\\", in 2004, Muralitharan indicated that he would skip future tours to Australia.  Tom Moody, the former Sri Lanka coach and former Australian Test cricketer, said he was embarrassed by the derogatory reaction and negative attention directed towards Muttiah Muralitharan by Australian crowds. Moody stated that \\"As an Australian when I have been with the Sri Lankan team in Australia, or playing against them in the World Cup, it's the only situation we find in the whole of the cricketing world where we have this disgraceful slant on a cricketer\\".  During the 2008 CB series in Australia, some members of the Sri Lankan contingent including Muralitharan, were the target of an egg throwing incident in Hobart. The Sri Lankan cricket selector Don Anurasiri was hit by an egg, while Muralitharan and two others were verbally abused by a car-load of people as they were walking from a restaurant back to the hotel. Due to the incident taking place at night, it is unclear whether Muralitharan was indeed the target of the culprits. Even though the Australian coach of the Sri Lankan team, Trevor Bayliss, down-played the incident as \\"a non-event\\", Cricket Australia tightened security around the team. In response to this episode Muralitharan was quoted as saying \\"When you come to Australia, you expect such incidents\\".  At the conclusion of Muralitharan's test career cricket writer Rahul Bhattacharya summed up Muralitharan's trials thus: \\"Murali is described often as a fox. This seems right. Unlike hedgehog bowlers who pursue one big idea, Murali, like a fox, had many ways of pursuit. Like a fox he did not hunt in a pack. Like a fox he was himself cruelly hunted for sport in some parts of the world. Fox hunting was banned a few years ago in England, but is still legal in Australia.\\"\\nQuestion: What year.

Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he submitted a number of paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected outright or drew little attention when exhibited. In 1821 he finally achieved recognition when the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of his works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, beating John Constable to the position.Following the success of Cleopatra, over the next decade, Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in nude studies, and although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.","target":"The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia","rationale":"The text describes how Etty was finally recognized as an artist in 1821 with the Royal Academy's acceptance of his work The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia.

This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.\\n\\nand the situation: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits.

These variations can be harmful or advantageous for survival and reproduction, but natural selection only causes heritable traits which are helpful to become more common in the population over time.

Émile Poulenc was a joint owner of the Poulenc Frères, a successful manufacturer of pharmaceuticals (later Rhône-Poulenc). He was a member of a pious Roman Catholic family from Espalion in the département of Aveyron. Jenny Poulenc was from a Parisian family with wide artistic interests. In Poulenc's view, the two sides of his nature grew out of this background: a deep religious faith from his father's family and a worldly and artistic side from his mother's. The critic Claude Rostand later described Poulenc as \\"half monk and half naughty boy\\".\\nPoulenc grew up in a musical household; his mother was a capable pianist, with a wide repertoire ranging from classical to less elevated works that gave him a lifelong taste for what he called \\"adorable bad music\\". He took piano lessons from the age of five; when he was eight he first heard the music of Debussy and was fascinated by the originality of the sound. Other composers whose works influenced his development were Schubert and Stravinsky: the former's Winterreise and the latter's The Rite of Spring made a deep impression on him. At his father's insistence, Poulenc followed a conventional school career, studying at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris rather than at a music conservatory.In 1916 a childhood friend, Raymonde Linossier (1897–1930), introduced Poulenc to Adrienne Monnier's bookshop, the Maison des Amis des Livres. There he met the avant-garde poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Paul Éluard and Louis Aragon. He later set many of their poems to music. In the same year he became the pupil of the pianist Ricardo Viñes. The biographer Henri Hell comments that Viñes's influence on his pupil was profound, both as to pianistic technique and the style of Poulenc's keyboard works. Poulenc later said of Viñes:\\nHe was a most delightful man, a bizarre hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style,...","target":"Jenny, née Royer","rationale":"The context suggests the answer to be \\"Jenny, née Royer\\", as it is mentioned that she was a capable pianist.\\nSo the answer is Jenny, nee Royer"},{"source":"Read the given text and if it has abusive content then indicate via \\"yes\\".

An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. Lacks was the unwitting source of these cells from a tumor biopsied during treatment for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., in 1951. These cells were then cultured by George Otto Gey who created the cell line known as HeLa, which is still used for medical research.\\n\\nGeorge Otto Gey, the first researcher to study Lacks's cancerous cells, observed that her cells were unique in that they reproduced at a very high rate and could be kept alive long enough to allow more in-depth examination. Until then, cells cultured for laboratory studies survived for only a few days at most, which wasn't long enough to perform a variety of different tests on the same sample. Lacks's cells were the first to be observed that could be divided multiple times without dying, which is why they became known as \\"immortal.\\" After Lacks' death, Gey had Mary Kubicek, his lab assistant, took further HeLa samples while Henrietta's body was at Johns Hopkins' autopsy facility. The roller-tube technique was the method used to culture the cells obtained from the samples that Kubicek collected. Gey was able to start a cell line from Lacks's sample by isolating one specific cell and repeatedly dividing it, meaning that the same cell could then be used for conducting many experiments. They became known as HeLa cells, because Gey's standard method for labeling samples was to use the first two letters of the patient's first and last names.  The ability to rapidly reproduce HeLa cells in a laboratory setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe whether cancer could be transmitted as well as to examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.  HeLa cells were in high demand and put into mass production. They were mailed to scientists around the globe for \\"research into cancer, AIDS, the effects of radiation and toxic substances, gene mapping, and countless other scientific pursuits\\". HeLa cells were the first human cells successfully cloned in 1955, and have since been used to test human sensitivity to tape, glue, cosmetics, and many other products. Since the 1950s, scientists have grown 20 tons of her cells, and there are almost 11,000 patents involving HeLa cells.  In the early 1970s, a large portion of other cell cultures became contaminated by HeLa cells. As a result, members of Henrietta Lacks's family received solicitations for blood samples from researchers hoping to learn about the family's genetics in order to differentiate between HeLa cells and other cell lines.  Alarmed and confused, several family members began questioning why they were receiving so many telephone calls requesting blood samples. In 1975, the family also learned through a chance dinner-party conversation that material originating in Henrietta Lacks was continuing to be used for medical research. The family had never discussed Henrietta's illness and death among themselves in the intervening years but with the increased curiosity about their mother and her genetics, they now began to ask questions.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Henrietta Lacks","rationale":"The text is an article about Henrietta Lacks, who was the unwitting source of a cell line used in many medical breakthroughs.

To address this, we have studied the expression of Na(V)1.5 and other Na+ channel isoforms in the AVN.   \\n METHODS AND RESULTS The rat AVN was identified by Masson's trichrome staining together with immunolabeling of marker proteins: connexin40, connexin43, desmoplakin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4. Na+ channel expression was investigated with immunohistochemistry with isoform-specific Na+ channel antibodies. Na(V)1.1 was distributed in a similar manner to Na(V)1.5. Na(V)1.2 was not detected. Na(V)1.3 labeling was present in nerve fibers and cell bodies (but not myocytes) and was abundant in the penetrating atrioventricular (AV) bundle and the common bundle but was much less abundant in other regions. Na(V)1.5 labeling was abundant in the atrial and ventricular myocardium and the left bundle branch. Na(V)1.5 labeling was absent in the open node, penetrating AV bundle, AV ring bundle, and common bundle but present at a reduced level in the inferior nodal extension and transitional zone. Na(V)1.6 was not detected.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide molecular evidence of multiple electrophysiological cell types at the AV junction. Impaired AV conduction as a result of mutations in or loss of Na(V)1.5 must be the result of impaired conduction in the AVN inputs (inferior nodal extension and transitional zone) or output (bundle branches) rather than the AVN itself (open node and penetrating AV bundle).","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract first provides background information on the heterogeneous electrical activity of the atrioventricular node (AVN) and on how this relates to distinct cell types and the 3-dimensional structure of the AVN.

Finally, it presents a summary of key findings related to Na+ channel expression in different regions of rat AVN tissue. In addition, it discusses potential implications for our understanding of impaired AV conduction as a result of mutations in or loss of Na(V)1.5 (i.e., an ion channel protein).

An object has greater momentum if it has greater mass, greater velocity, or both. For example, a bowling ball has greater momentum than a softball when both are moving at the same velocity because the bowling ball has greater mass. However, a softball moving at a very high velocity — say, 100 miles an hour — would have greater momentum than a slow-rolling bowling ball. If an object isn’t moving at all, it has no momentum.

Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows. Mammals take oxygen into their lungs, and discard carbon dioxide.","target":"Mammal","rationale":"The context mentions that breathing is controlled by the diaphragm, which separates the abdominal and thoracic cavities.

Afterwards, he kept the bag B foods in a place with no moisture, and the bag C foods in a place with high moisture.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich foods would be more susceptible to spoilage, bag A or bag B?\\n\\nHint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.","target":"bag A","rationale":"The foods in bag B were treated using the sugaring method, which creates an environment hostile to microbial life and prevents food spoilage.

After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.\\n\\nHint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.","target":"France","rationale":"The Laffer Curve shows the amount of government revenue as a function of the tax rate. For low and high tax rates, increasing taxes will lead to higher revenues. However, if a country is at an intermediate level between these two regions, further increases in taxes can actually decrease overall revenue because people are disincentivized from working more or investing their money back into businesses that create jobs.\\nIn this case we have information about France’s pro-socialist governments implementing “tax rate above the critical rate” after WWII.

The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted.

Passage:Barnsley Football Club is an English association football club based in the South Yorkshire town of Barnsley. Founded in 1887 under the name Barnsley St Peter's, the team played in the Sheffield & District League from the 1890–91 season and first entered the FA Cup in 1893–94. Two years later, they were accepted into the Midland League. The club changed its name to Barnsley F.C. in 1897; its team finished as Midland League runners-up in the first season under the new name, and were elected to the newly expanded Second Division of the Football League for the 1898–99 season. A 16th-place finish in their second season meant they had to apply for re-election; the application was successful, and Barnsley continued safely in mid-table until 1911, when they again needed to be re-elected to the League. Their cup form was rather better: either side of that poor League placing, they reached the FA Cup final. In 1909–10, they drew 1–1 with Newcastle United in the final at Crystal Palace, but lost 1–0 in the replay at Everton's Goodison Park ground. Two seasons later, after taking three replays to get through the quarter-final, they played out a goalless draw with West Bromwich Albion at Crystal Palace; this time Barnsley won the replay, at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground, by one goal to nil.\\n Links: a.

The Creeks rose up as the largest deerskin supplier, and the increase in supply only intensified European demand for deerskins. Native Americans continued to negotiate the most lucrative trade deals by forcing England, France, and Spain to compete for their supply of deerskins. In the 1750s and 1760s, the Seven Years' War disrupted France's ability to provide manufactures goods to its allies, the Choctaws and Chickasaw. The French and Indian War further disrupted trade, as the British blockaded French goods. The Cherokees allied themselves with France, who were driven out from the southeast in accordance with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The British were now the dominant trading power in the southeast.  While both the Cherokee and the Creek were the main trading partners of the British, their relationships with the British were different. The Creeks adapted to the new economic trade system, and managed to hold onto their old social structures. Originally Cherokee land was divided into five districts; however, the number soon grew to thirteen districts with 200 hunters assigned per district due to deerskin demand.  Charleston and Savannah were the main trading ports for the export of deerskins. Deerskins became the most popular export, and monetarily supported the colonies with the revenue produced by taxes on deerskins. Charleston's trade was regulated by the Indian Trade Commission, composed of traders who monopolized the market and profited off the sale of deerskins. From the beginning of the 18th century to mid-century, the deerskin exports of Charleston more than doubled in exports. Charleston received tobacco and sugar from the West Indies and rum from the North in exchange for deerskins. In return for deerskins, Great Britain sent woolens, guns, ammunition, iron tools, clothing, and other manufactured goods that were traded to the Native Americans.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Were there any wars or conflicts that disrupted the fur trade during this period?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"Seven Years' War","rationale":"Since the context talks about trade between Europeans and Native Americans, it is clear that the correct answer to this question should be a war or conflict which disrupted their trade.

Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places.

By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.

Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London.\\nNumerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","target":"Diego","rationale":"This article is about the \\"Rokeby Venus\\" painting.

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change.

In November 1953, MGM announced it had assigned producer Sam Zimbalist to the picture and hired screenwriter Karl Tunberg to write it. Zimbalist was chosen because he had produced MGM's Best Picture-nominated Christians-and-lions epic Quo Vadis in 1951. The studio then announced in July 1954 that production would start in March 1955 with 42 speaking parts and 97 sets. MGM said Sidney Franklin would direct, that the script by Tunberg was finished, that shooting would occur in Rome and in Spain, and that Marlon Brando was up for the lead. In September 1955, Zimbalist, who continued to claim that Tunberg's script was complete, announced that a $7 million, six-to-seven month production would begin in April 1956 in either Israel or Egypt in MGM's new 65mm widescreen process. MGM, however, suspended production in early 1956.\\n Passage 3:The station opened on 29 November 1844 by the Dublin and Drogheda Railway Company as Dublin Station, but was renamed Amiens Street Station ten years later after the street on which it is located. Originally the station served only a single mainline to Drogheda, and in 1853 through services to Belfast commenced. In 1891, the City of Dublin Junction Railway connected the station with Westland Row Station (now Pearse Station) on the city's South side. The City of Dublin Junction had a separate station known as Amiens Street Junction consisting of the present platforms 5, 6, and 7 (currently used by DART, Commuter and Rosslare services) with a separate street entrance. After the amalgamation of the GNR (I) at the end of the 1950s, this station became part of Amiens Street and the separate entrance fell into disuse. The City of Dublin Junction Railway allowed services to run from Amiens Street through to Westland Row to Rosslare and the South East. Services to Sligo were transferred to Westland Row (Pearse Station) running non-stop through the station in 1937, with the closure of Broadstone Station by CIÉ (see also MGWR). Services to Galway and Mayo also terminated at Westland Row, operating through Connolly Station after 1937, running via Mullingar and Athlone. This was discontinued in the 1970s in favour of running services from Heuston Station. Sunday trains to Cork, Limerick and Waterford during the 1960s operated from Connolly platforms 5, 6 and 7 through the Phoenix Park Tunnel, so as to avoid the cost of opening Heuston for the limited Sunday traffic demand at that time.","target":"3","rationale":"Passage 3 provides information regarding the GDP of Belfast."},{"source":"Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not.

Professor Esmail Zanjani of University of Nevada, US, has spent seven years And over $9 million on the work.

Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers, there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids, and Native American tales strengthened their credibility. In 1869, one-armed Civil War veteran John Wesley Powell led an expedition from Green River Station in Wyoming, aiming to run the two rivers all the way down to St. Thomas, Nevada, near present-day Hoover Dam. Powell and nine men – none of whom had prior whitewater experience – set out in May. After braving the rapids of the Gates of Lodore, Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado, the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River, where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words ever written about the Grand Canyon of the Colorado:\\nWe are now ready to start on our way down the Great Unknown. Our boats, tied to a common stake, are chafing each other, as they are tossed by the fretful river. They ride high and buoyant, for their loads are lighter than we could desire. We have but a month's rations remaining. The flour has been re-sifted through the mosquito net sieve; the spoiled bacon has been dried, and the worst of it boiled; the few pounds of dried apples have been spread in the sun, and re-shrunken to their normal bulk; the sugar has all melted, and gone on its way down the river; but we have a large sack of coffee. The lighting of the boats has this advantage: they will ride the waves better, and we shall have little to carry when we make a portage.\\nWe are three-quarters of a mile in the depths of the earth, and the great river shrinks into insignificance, as it dashes its angry waves against the walls and cliffs, that rise to the world above; they are but puny ripples, and we but pigmies, running up and down the sands, or lost among the boulders.\\nWe have an unknown distance yet to run; an unknown river yet to explore....","target":"apples","rationale":"The answer is \\"apples\\".

The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.","target":"Group A","rationale":"The paragraph describes a comparison between two groups of organisms.

Passage:The Oakland Athletics selected Burton out of Western Carolina University in the eighth round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He lost his remaining eligibility at Western Carolina by signing with Oakland on June 12, 2002. The A's sent him to their Single-A affiliate, the Vancouver Canadians. With Vancouver he had a 0–4 win–loss record with a 3.58 earned run average (ERA) in 13 games. He followed up his 2002 season with 15 appearances for the Kane County Cougars in 2003. With Kane County he improved both his win–loss ratio to a 2–1 and his ERA to 2.27. The 2004 season was less consistent for Burton, splitting time between two of the Athletics farm teams, the Arizona League Athletics (AZL Athletics) (Rookie League) and the Modesto A's (Single-A). Burton had a 1–0 record and a 4.16 ERA with the AZL Athletics. While in Modesto he had a 3–2 win–loss ratio and a 4.78 ERA. Overall, Burton pitched a combined 53.2 innings in 15 games in 2004.

Coming to prominence while a member of Count Basie's orchestra, Young was one of the most influential players on his instrument. In contrast to many of his hard-driving peers, Young played with a relaxed, cool tone and used sophisticated harmonies, using what one critic called \\"a free-floating style, wheeling and diving like a gull, banking with low, funky riffs that pleased dancers and listeners alike\\". Known for his hip, introverted style, he invented or popularized much of the hipster jargon which came to be associated with the music.\\n\\nYoung left the Basie band in late 1940. He is rumored to have refused to play with the band on Friday, December 13 of that year for superstitious reasons spurring his dismissal, although Young and drummer Jo Jones would later state that his departure had been in the works for months. He subsequently led a number of small groups that often included his brother, drummer Lee Young, for the next couple of years; live and broadcast recordings from this period exist.  During this period Young accompanied the singer Billie Holiday in a couple of studio sessions (during 1937 - 1941 period) and also made a small set of recordings with Nat \\"King\\" Cole (their first of several collaborations) in June 1942. His studio recordings are relatively sparse during the 1942 to 1943 period, largely due to the recording ban by the American Federation of Musicians. Small record labels not bound by union contracts continued to record and he recorded some sessions for Harry Lim's Keynote label in 1943.  In December 1943 Young returned to the Basie fold for a 10-month stint, cut short by his being drafted into the army during World War II (see below). Recordings made during this and subsequent periods suggest Young was beginning to make much greater use of a plastic reed, which tended to give his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone (although still quite smooth compared to that of many other players). While he never abandoned the cane reed, he used the plastic reed a significant share of the time from 1943 until the end of his life. Another cause for the thickening of his tone around this time was a change in saxophone mouthpiece from a metal Otto Link to an ebonite Brilhart. In August 1944 Young appeared alongside drummer Jo Jones, trumpeter Harry \\"Sweets\\" Edison, and fellow tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet in Gjon Mili's short film Jammin' the Blues.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Why did he change to a plastic reed?","target":"which tended to give his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone","rationale":"The passage states: \\"Recordings made during this and subsequent periods suggest Young was beginning to make much greater use of a plastic reed, which tended to give his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone (although still quite smooth compared to that of many other players).

The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel...\\nWhat happened in the town of Olhão? \\nI was going to say \\"A ritual\\".

Because once you become an adult, you are free to make your own decisions. More importantly, you can do all those things that you cannot do now because you are too young. So, the question is, 'At what age do you really become an adult?' Well, people become adults at different ages in different places.\\nIn Australia, the 18th birthday is a very important event for young Australians because it means they can do almost anything they want. They can vote, learn to drive a car, get married, join the army and even buy their own houses. However, even if they can do all these things, most Australians have to wait until their 21st birthday to really celebrate becoming an adult. This is the traditional adult age not only in Australia, but also in the USA and the UK. It is their first year of true independence  .Traditionally, people were given a key to their houses by their parents when they turned 21, meaning they could come and go as they like.\\nEven though 21 is the traditional adult age in many English-speaking countries, the law nowadays is different in each country. In the UK, you can join the army at 16 and even get married at 16 if your parents allow. Young people in the UK can learn to drive a car at 17 as in Australia, although they have to wait until they are 18 to vote.\\nIn China, there is a different age for each of the stages of becoming an adult. You can vote and learn to drive a car when you are 18, but if you want to get married, women have to wait until they are 20 and men until they are 22. Chinese people celebrate important birthdays every 10 years--so when young people turn 20, they can expect a big party!\\nNo matter what age you are, becoming an adult is really about learning how to be independent and responsible . Once you are finally able to take care of yourself and make your own decisions, then you can say that you are truly all grown-ups.\\nQuestion: Why do people in Australia get the key to the houses when they really become adults?\\nOptions: A: Because the law decides it.\\nB: Because they can leave when they want.\\nC: Because they can come home when they want.\\nD: Because it is a tradition.","target":"D","rationale":"In Australia, people traditionally give the key to their houses on 21st birthday.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it.

This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art.

Passage:At the start of the Second World War before the US entered the war, there were a large number of American volunteers offering their services. No. 71 was formed at RAF Church Fenton on 19 September 1940 with Brewster Buffalos. Appraisal by Royal Air Force acceptance personnel criticised the Brewster Buffalo on numerous points, including lack of armament and pilot armour, poor high-altitude performance, engine overheating, unreliability and cockpit controls, while it was praised for its handling, roomy cockpit and visibility. The aircraft were deemed unsuitable for European conditions and Hawker Hurricanes replaced them from November 1940. The squadron became operational at RAF Kirton-in-Lindsey on 5 February 1941 and moved in April to RAF Martlesham Heath in Suffolk for operations over Europe. During May, it suffered its first loss when Mike Kolendorski was killed during a fighter sweep over the Netherlands. The intensity of operations stepped up with a move into No 11 Group of Fighter Command, being based at RAF North Weald in Essex by June 1941. On 2 July, William J. Hall became the first Eagle Squadron pilot to become a Prisoner of War (POW) when he was shot down during an escort mission. The squadron's first confirmed victory came on 21 July 1941 during a bomber escort mission, when Pilot Officer William R. Dunn destroyed a Messerschmitt Bf 109F over Lille. In August, the Spitfire Mk II replaced 71 Squadron's Hurricanes, before the squadron quickly re-equipped with the latest Spitfire Mk VB. The unit soon established a high reputation, and numerous air kill claims were made in RAF fighter sweeps over the continent during the summer and autumn of 1941. In December, the Squadron was rested back at Martlesham Heath, before a move to Debden in May 1942. When informed of the attack on Pearl Harbor, most of the Eagle Squadron pilots wanted to immediately join the fight against Japan. Representatives from 71 and 121 Squadrons went to the American Embassy in London and offered their services to the United States. The pilots from 71 Squadron decided they wanted to go to Singapore to fight the Japanese and a proposal was put to RAF Fighter Command, but it was turned down. On 29 September 1942 the squadron, together with the other two Eagle squadrons, was transferred to the US Army Air Forces, becoming the 334th Fighter Squadron of the 4th Fighter Group.","target":"a","rationale":"To answer the question, information about the formation of No. 71 and information about when the Second World War began is needed."},{"source":"(CNN) -- We should all be so lucky to have friends like Elvis Cole and Joe Pike.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.\\n\\nParagraph: Hydrologists studied two samples of rain water. Jim studied an acid rain sample from a nearby city, and Dan studied a sample of water from another town.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which hydrologist learned more about the causes of acid rain formation?","target":"Jim","rationale":"From the background, we know that acid rain is caused by sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. The paragraph tells us that Jim studied an acid rain sample from a nearby city where there are lots of cars (where motor vehicle exhaust would be present). Dan studied water from another town which was farther away from any cities with large populations of vehicles. Therefore, since it can be inferred that Jim studied samples closer to industrial areas while Dan probably did not, it's more likely that Jim learned more about the causes of acid rain formation than Dan because he drew his conclusions based on samples collected in places where air pollution would most commonly occur.

Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important, they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied. Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V, which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals, there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999).

Passage:By August 1995, the station – which would change its call sign that month to WACY-TV – benefited from WGBA's affiliation switch to NBC (due to WLUK-TV, channel 11, joining Fox). With WGBA now committed to NBC and its programming lineup, programs that WGBA no longer had room to broadcast were moved over to WACY, including some syndicated programming (most notably reruns of The Simpsons) and daytime children's programming. With this move, WACY adopted the \\"WACkY 32\\" branding for its kids' lineup (running roughly 6-11 a.m. and 1-5 p.m.), which over the years would include Garfield and Friends, Scooby-Doo, Dennis the Menace, Pokémon, Sailor Moon and Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog; programs from the UPN Kids and The Disney Afternoon blocks (as well as from Kids' WB as the Green Bay television market did not have a full-time WB affiliate); and educational and informational-compliant programs like The New Zoo Revue. The live character \\"Cuddles the Clown\\" provided host continuity for \\"WACkY 32\\" programming. The station's children's lineup would dwindle over the years, thanks in part to increased cable competition from cable channels such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon and the decreased financial justification of airing a more-than-necessary amount of children's programming, although it would continue to air UPN's Disney's One Too until the network discontinued its daily children's block in 2003.

In this paper, we set out to answer these questions by studying multiple phase transitions in the IB objective: IB_β[p(z|x)] = I(X; Z) − βI(Y; Z) defined on the encoding distribution p(z|x) for input X, target Y and representation Z, where sudden jumps of dI(Y; Z)/dβ and prediction accuracy are observed with increasing β. We introduce a definition for IB phase transitions as a qualitative change of the IB loss landscape, and show that the transitions correspond to the onset of learning new classes. Using second-order calculus of variations, we derive a formula that provides a practical condition for IB phase transitions, and draw its connection with the Fisher information matrix for parameterized models. We provide two perspectives to understand the formula, revealing that each IB phase transition is finding a component of maximum (nonlinear) correlation between X and Y orthogonal to the learned representation, in close analogy with canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) in linear settings. Based on the theory, we present an algorithm for discovering phase transition points. Finally, we verify that our theory and algorithm accurately predict phase transitions in categorical datasets, predict the onset of learning new classes and class difficulty in MNIST, and predict prominent phase transitions in CIFAR10.","target":"We give a theoretical analysis of the Information Bottleneck objective to understand and predict observed phase transitions in the prediction vs. compression tradeoff","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe give a theoretical analysis of the Information Bottleneck objective to understand and predict observed phase transitions in the prediction vs. compression tradeoff."},{"source":"Article: In the general election, against the advice of his advisors, Eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South, refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party.

Hence, if he decreases the rate at which gas exits from underneath his rocket then its overall momentum will be reduced since less fuel can now be burned with each unit time spent flying - either way though, I'm still cheering for him!\\n\\nSo answer: decrease"},{"source":"You will be given a passage consisting of set of facts and a question as input.

However, the underlying deterministic model was criticized widely, and other modeling studies did not always confirm the study's finding. The objective of our study is to better understand the implications of different model structures and assumptions, so as to arrive at the best possible predictions of the long-term impact of UTT and the possibility of elimination of HIV.   \\n METHODS AND FINDINGS We developed nine structurally different mathematical models of the South African HIV epidemic in a stepwise approach of increasing complexity and realism. The simplest model resembles the initial deterministic model, while the most comprehensive model is the stochastic microsimulation model STDSIM, which includes sexual networks and HIV stages with different degrees of infectiousness. We defined UTT as annual screening and immediate ART for all HIV-infected adults, starting at 13% in January 2012 and scaled up to 90% coverage by January 2019. All models predict elimination, yet those that capture more processes underlying the HIV transmission dynamics predict elimination at a later point in time, after 20 to 25 y. Importantly, the most comprehensive model predicts that the current strategy of ART at CD4 count ≤350 cells/µl will also lead to elimination, albeit 10 y later compared to UTT. Still, UTT remains cost-effective, as many additional life-years would be saved. The study's major limitations are that elimination was defined as incidence below 1/1,000 person-years rather than 0% prevalence, and drug resistance was not modeled.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm previous predictions that the HIV epidemic in South Africa can be eliminated through universal testing and immediate treatment at 90% coverage. However, more realistic models show that elimination is likely to occur at a much later point in time than the initial model suggested. Also, UTT is a cost-effective intervention, but less cost-effective than previously predicted because the current South African ART treatment policy alone could already drive HIV into elimination.

A much smaller group of autotrophs - mostly bacteria in dark or low-oxygen environments - produce food using the chemical energy stored in inorganic molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, or methane. While photosynthesis transforms light energy to chemical energy, this alternate method of making food transfers chemical energy from inorganic to organic molecules. It is therefore called chemosynthesis , and is characteristic of the tubeworms shown in Figure below . Some of the most recently discovered chemosynthetic bacteria inhabit deep ocean hot water vents or “black smokers. ” There, they use the energy in gases from the Earth’s interior to produce food for a variety of unique heterotrophs: giant tube worms, blind shrimp, giant white crabs, and armored snails. Some scientists think that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of Mars, Jupiter's moon, Europa, and other planets as well. Ecosystems based on chemosynthesis may seem rare and exotic, but they too illustrate the absolute dependence of heterotrophs on autotrophs for food.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- gases\\n\\n- nutrients\\n\\n- Carbon\\n\\n- photosynthesis\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"photosynthesis","rationale":"The paragraph above states that photosynthesis provides over 99% of the energy supply for life on Earth, so it must be what process is being referred to in this question."},{"source":"You are provided with a list of converations between a \\"USER\\" and \\"ASSISTANT\\".

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods.

Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium.

He would constantly start verbally harassing me after he lost his job. I'm guessing because he feels inadequate as a man? Don't know. He's the reason why my older brother left the house, he judged my brother for being homosexual. I love my brother, I never forgave him for this. He has two kids that are my half siblings and he treats them very well. He has no job and completely dependent on my mom. I'm honestly not okay with that but that is her life and I can't say anything because then I'd be a hypocrite. One day he got mad at me because I brought home pizza that was ordered by my girlfriend. It wasn't for me, but she was hungry and bought a pizza for us. My half siblings are usually fed by my step dad but recently he hasn't had ANY money so doesn't seem to be able to provide for them. He started cussing me out for not thinking about my siblings and also buying them food but I kept telling him I didn't buy this. I can't provide for them daily, I don't have the money. This made him more angry and usually I bite my tongue but I couldn't and told him to go fuck himself. He pushed me into a cabinet and busted my head, I started bleeding and my mom came home. At first she was angry at him and kicked him out the house but a week later she broke and let him lived here again. I gave her an ultimatum of choosing letting him live here or I would leave the house. I don't feel safe with him here, he's much larger than me. She chose to let him live here and I didn't handle that very well. I started to verbally attack her in the sense that I told her she was a terrible mother for ever picking a man over her child. I admit, that was wrong of me but I was just so angry. I'm now in process of moving out, but I don't have much of a savings (around $1000 USD) but I just can't live in this household anymore.

However, other organism groups, such as calcifying algae, especially members of the red algae Rhodophyta, and molluscs (especially the rudist bivalves during the Cretaceous Period) have created massive structures at various times. During the Cambrian Period, the conical or tubular skeletons of Archaeocyatha, an extinct group of uncertain affinities (possibly sponges), built reefs. Other groups, such as the Bryozoa have been important interstitial organisms, living between the framework builders. The corals which build reefs today, the Scleractinia, arose after the Permian–Triassic extinction event that wiped out the earlier rugose corals (as well as many other groups), and became increasingly important reef builders throughout the Mesozoic Era. They may have arisen from a rugose coral ancestor. Rugose corals built their skeletons of calcite and have a different symmetry from that of the scleractinian corals, whose skeletons are aragonite. However, there are some unusual examples of well-preserved aragonitic rugose corals in the Late Permian. In addition, calcite has been reported in the initial post-larval calcification in a few scleractinian corals. Nevertheless, scleractinian corals (which arose in the middle Triassic) may have arisen from a non-calcifying ancestor independent of the rugosan corals (which disappeared in the late Permian).\\n Passage 3:The name \\"Lord Haw-Haw of Zeesen\\" was coined in 1939 by the pseudonymous Daily Express radio critic Jonah Barrington, but this referred initially to Wolf Mittler (or possibly Norman Baillie-Stewart). When Joyce became the best-known propaganda broadcaster, the nickname was transferred to him. Joyce's broadcasts initially came from studios in Berlin, later transferring (because of heavy Allied bombing) to Luxembourg and finally to Apen near Hamburg, and were relayed over a network of German-controlled radio stations that included Hamburg, Bremen, Luxembourg, Hilversum, Calais, Oslo, and Zeesen. Joyce also broadcast on and wrote scripts for the German Büro Concordia organisation, which ran several black propaganda stations, many of which pretended to broadcast illegally from within Britain. His role in writing the scripts increased over time, and the German radio capitalized on his public persona. Initially an anonymous broadcaster, Joyce eventually revealed his real name to his listeners; and he would occasionally be announced as \\"William Joyce, otherwise known as Lord Haw-Haw\\". Urban legends soon circulated about Lord Haw-Haw, alleging that the broadcaster was well-informed about political and military events to the point of near-omniscience.","target":"2","rationale":"The question refers to the \\"Phanerozoic period\\" and asks which coral reef group went extinct first during that period.

We hypothesized that while asymptomatic carriage would not increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and graft loss, severe infection would. Methods-All lung transplant cases between January 2000 and July 2013 performed at our center were reviewed for respiratory viral samples.

Multivariate Cox modeling was employed to assess the impact of CARV isolation on progression to CLAD and graft loss. Results-4408 specimens were collected from 563 total patients with 139 patients producing 324 virus positive specimens in 245 episodes of CARV infection. Overall, the risk of CLAD was elevated by viral infection (HR 1.64, p < 0.01). This risk, however, was due to viral pneumonia alone (HR 3.94, p < 0.01), without significant impact from symptomatic viral infection (HR 0.97, p = 0.94) nor from asymptomatic viral infection (HR 0.99, p = 0.98).

If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication).\\n\\nOver time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8]\\n\\nRicky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations.\\n\\nWhich path will have higher pheromone density?","target":"path A","rationale":"The initial number of ants that travel down each path is unknown, so the relative pheromone density will be determined by how quickly the trail evaporates given the length of time it takes to traverse a specific path.\\nSince Path B requires more time to walk along than Path A, fewer trips can be made at any one point in time on those paths compared with Path A (which is shorter). Therefore there are less reinforcements for ant trails and therefore lower pheromone density on longer trails like Path B.

Enough sleep helps the body and brain grow and develop. According to the National Sleep Foundation in the US, adults need seven to nine hours of sleep every night. For students aged 10 to 17, a healthy amount is about eight to nine hours per night.\\nBut many students don't get enough sleep because of early school start times and heavy homework. About 80 percent of middle school students don't get enough sleep, the China Youth and Children Research Center reported. For some students, they want to sleep early, but they keep worrying about their schoolwork and can't fall asleep quickly. For others, they may even have _ which might keep them awake all night.\\nThese sleeping problems greatly affect people's lives. Experts have shown that lack of sleep for teenagers leads to poor grades. Students without enough sleep cannot pay attention in class or do well in sports. Also, the lack of sleep may make them depressed  .\\nLuckily, with good sleep habits, it is easier to fall asleep. Some of these good habits include avoiding drinks that make people excited late in the day, going to sleep at the same time each night, and sleeping in a comfortable place that is dark, quiet, and neither too warm nor too cold.\\nQuestion: Which of the following are good sleeping habits?\\nAnswer:","target":"b and c","rationale":"The article mentions that lack of sleep can lead to poor grades.

Bono labelled it \\"a more meditative album on the theme of pilgrimage\\". Provisionally titled Songs of Ascent, it would be a sister release to No Line on the Horizon, similar to Zooropa's relationship to Achtung Baby. In June 2009, Bono said that although nine tracks had been completed, the album would only be released if its quality surpassed that of No Line on the Horizon. A December 2009 report stated that U2 had been working in the studio with the goal of a mid-2010 release. The band revealed that the first single was intended to be \\"Every Breaking Wave\\".Over time, the album continued to be delayed. In April 2010, U2's manager Paul McGuinness confirmed that the album would not be finished by June, but indicated that a release \\"before the end of the year [was] increasingly likely.\\" In October 2010, Bono stated that their new album would be produced by Danger Mouse, and that 12 songs had been completed. He also noted that U2 were working on a potential album of club music in the spirit of \\"U2's remixes in the 1990s\\".

In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics.

Such an ocular dominance shift has been assumed to depend on patterned visual experience, because no change in cortical physiology is produced by inequalities between the two eyes in retinal illumination or temporally modulated diffuse light stimulation. A higher-level process, involving gating signals from areas outside striate cortex, has been proposed to ensure that sustained changes in synaptic efficacy occur only in response to behaviourally significant visual inputs. To test whether such a process is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity, we treated 4-week-old kittens with visual deprivation and monocular tetrodotoxin (TTX) injections to create an imbalance in the electrical activities of the two retinas in the absence of patterned vision. After 1 week of treatment we determined the ocular dominance distribution of single units in primary visual cortex. In all kittens studied, a significant ocular dominance shift was found. In addition to this physiological change, there was an anatomical change in the lateral geniculate nucleus, where cells were larger in laminae receiving input from the more active eye.

There was a comment box where I put that I wanted to get a dessert with a candle on it for my bf, which was super convenient because I didn't have to tell the waiter on the day of and ruin the surprise.On the day of, I got a confirmation call from Jacobs & Co. The person was super nice over the phone and asked if I wanted to order the dessert in advance so they could get it all ready and we didn't have to look at the dessert menu. This was super efficient and helped reinforce the surprise element (my bf had no idea!) When we got there, we were greeted at the door by a very sweet hostess. The hostess inside walked us upstairs to our table. I was surprised at the beautiful lounge area. There was a pianist and piano bar area and it looked like such a classy place to chill after work or on a Friday evening. I would go back to do this!Our waiter was super knowledgable and friendly. Since we don't know much about steaks, he took the time to explain where each cow came from, what they were feed and how this affects the taste of the steak, and even assessed what we liked, and offered recommendations! We ordered:Bread (free) - warm and buttery goodness!The infamous caesar salad - I was super impressed with the amount of ingredients that was in the salad and that it took the server about 15 minutes to make it in front of us. My only tip for improvement is to indicate on the menu that the salad is spicy because tabasco sauce is added. If I knew this, I would have asked for that to be omitted since I am a weaksauce for spice. We didn't see all the ingredients on her table either. This was a pretty great salad if people like a little kick in their caesar.

Pricey, but definitely worth the experience. 5/5The ribeye was really tender and juicy. It was pretty fatty to me and to be honest, I was too spoiled by the Striploin to truly think anything else could be better. However, the ribeye was very nicely flavoured and definitely a steak better than ruth chris or the keg, in my opinion. 4/5They also gave us a bunch of sauces, honey goat cheese, and other condiments, but we really didn't need them at all. In fact, we thought the sauces and such ruined the taste of the steak so we didn't use them.2oz Foie Gras - This was pretty delicious and flavourful. I haven't had foie gras in years so I can't really compare, but this was very juicy and tender. 4/5Chocolate Walnut Brownie - this was amazing!!! Rich chocolatey flavour brownie with lots of walnuts. The ice cream was toasted marshmallow, which is pretty unique. There was a long piece of marshmallow, which added to the favour of this dessert. ME LIKIE! 5/5Two chocolate sweets (free) -  a nice touch. if you just wanted a bit of sweetness and don't want to spend on dessert (or you rather get something else for this price) then this is good enough!All of this was followed by the infamous chocolate chip muffins that we got to take home for the next day. They were delicious when we both had it for breakie! Soft and moist!We left super full and then some. The bill came up to around $300 with tax and tip. We didn't get alcohol. Definitely a fine dining restaurant that served its purpose of a special night out to celebrate a special occasion. My bf loved it!This may be TMI, but the following day, my stomach was in knots. I suspect it was the amount of richness and butter that was used to prepare the food. I don't normally eat a lot of butter so it makes sense why I was having gastro issues the next day. My bf was completely fine and woke up still full from the night before!  A fine restaurant that gets you that full - BONUS! ;)Finally, we had leftover ribeye and duck fries that we ate 3 days later. We fried the steak a bit to heat it up and it was STILL as delicious as the day we tried it. The fries were a little soggy, but edible.Overall, I would definitely recommend Jacob and Co for a special occasion or for the steak lovers out there. Definitely one of the best steakhouses in Toronto!\\nquestion: Why is bread so delicious?","target":"Bread ( free ) - warm","rationale":"The question is about why bread is so delicious and the answer is \\"Bread ( free ) - warm\\" because the review states that the bread was warm and buttery goodness."},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true:\\n\\nIt has become increasingly clear that Iran is making rapid progress toward attaining a nuclear weapons capability as U.S. officials have confirmed the presence of various nuclear sites that Tehran has failed to disclose\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- Yes\\n- It's impossible to say\\n- No\\nHypothesis: Iran is making rapid progress in something","target":"Yes","rationale":"The passage states that Iran is making rapid progress toward attaining a nuclear weapons capability, which meets the criteria for supporting the hypothesis.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\\n\\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ? POST : Last year, me and my best friend of a few years (who i will call James) drifted apart significantly. I wasn't particularly upset at all once I noticed; this had happened several times previously with other friends, and I understand that it is natural. A new person (who I will call Amy) joined our friend group. I introduced my friends to her -- if that is of any importance --  and James became closer to Katie (keep in mind that their are no romantic feelings between us, except that he told me he liked me in the beginning of our friendship, and asked me out. I said no. James says he has gotten over it). \\n\\nAlthough he became closer to her than he was with me, I am now closer to her than James is. She admits this fact, and she is one to be brutally honest about those types of things, so I'm taking her word for it. Amy has (without getting too deep into it) several types of mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. She also has suffering physical health, as she has an iron deficiency and frequent knee pains despite our young age. She is constantly self-deprecating, as most of our friend group is. \\n\\nJames is over-protective of Amy. If she ever makes any doubtful comment about herself, James will spends minutes ranting about how she shouldn't put herself down and how wonderful she is. Sometimes he shows signs of aggression in tone of voice when he rants. IMO, it is fairly creepy, and Amy shares this sentiment. I do not know if the strong feelings James has towards Amy are romantic (though I know a relationship between them would be imps James has been unnecessarily rude and hateful towards me the past few months. He has made comments about my appearence, my personality, and other aspects of my life I am not comfortable sharing. He later claimed these remarks as jokes, but I am firm that in the context and the way he said them that they were fully intended. James knows that I am moderately insecure, and yet he still does this. \\n\\nFor example, our friend group has weekly get-togethers where we can hang out and just discuss things. At a recent one, another one of our friends seemed upset. All of us told her that if she wants to talk about what had made her upset, she can, but she doesn't have to. When James told her this, he said, \\"You can talk to all of us about anything, except [my name], because she'll just joke about it.\\" He said this in a completely serious tone of voice, and even some of the other's (including the friend he was talking to) looked at him in awe, also surprised he said something like that. Throughout the remainder of the day, he constantly shit on me for seemingly no reason. The fact that someone who I was once very close with -- and someone who knew my insecurities in detail -- would talk about me in that way was devestating. I was upset for the rest of the week, though I tried not to show it around my friends. \\n\\nNow on to the potential asshole-ry: Amy threw a party a few days after Christmas. When she invited me, I immediately asked if James was coming. She told me that he might, but he wasn't sure, and I told her that I most likely wouldn't come if James went, because of how he had been acting. My mental health had been suffering, and my self-confidence was at an all time low. She said she understood, but that she needed me to be at the party for mental support, as she is not used to having to interact with so many people. She offered to talk to James and tell him that somebody might not be coming to the party because of his behaviour in the past weeks. I accepted, as long as she didn't say my name, which I admit is a bit cowardly. \\n\\nThe next day, James texted the group chat and said basically that Amy had told him what she told me she would say, and that he had been talking to his therapist about how he was acting. I don't know if I believe him about that or not, based on that it doesn't really seem he's making an effort to stop, and it also seems he enjoys putting me down. I replied and said I don't have to suffer just because he didn't have his shit together, and just because we weren't best friends anymore doesn't mean he can insult me constantly.\\n\\nI feel insanely guilty about this. I feel as though it wasn't my place to comment on his state of mind, and I also feel guilty for not believing him about his therapist. James never replied to my message, but several of our friends replied and said fighting would just break us apart. I agree with that statement.\\n\\nIn case any of you were wondering, James did end up going to the party. I went despite this fact, and we kind of ignored each other the entire time. Am I the asshole for saying the things I did? Sorry for the short novel length of the post, I had a lot of information to give.\\n\\nTL;DR: My friend had been very rude to me lately, I said I wouldn't go to a party if he was there because of it, my other friend told him, he says something about his therapist and I say I don't have to suffer because he doesn't have his shit together.

Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, scientist, engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar. Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court.\\n\\nZhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first odometer, an achievement also attributed to Archimedes (c. 287-212 BC) and Heron of Alexandria (fl. AD 10-70). Similar devices were used by the Roman and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rd century, the Chinese had termed the device the ji li gu che, or \\"li-recording drum carriage\\" (the modern measurement of li = 500 m/1640 ft).  Ancient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage's functions; after one li was traversed, a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum, and after ten li had been covered, another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm. However, there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered on the \\"huang men\\"--court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) who followed the musical procession of the royal \\"drum-chariot\\". There is speculation that at some time during the 1st century BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels. This might have actually been the design of Luoxia Hong (c. 110 BC), yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known, as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb.  The south-pointing chariot was another mechanical device credited to Zhang Heng. It was a non-magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot. Differential gears driven by the chariot's wheels allowed a wooden figurine (in the shape of a Chinese state minister) to constantly point to the south, hence its name. The Song Shu (c. AD 500 ) records that Zhang Heng re-invented it from a model used in the Zhou Dynasty era, but the violent collapse of the Han Dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved. Whether Zhang Heng invented it or not, Ma Jun (200-265) succeeded in creating the chariot in the following century.\\n\\nWas there anything else he created?","target":"inventing the first odometer,","rationale":"The text states that Zhang Heng was famous for inventing the first odometer, as well as another mechanical device known as \\"the south-pointing chariot\\".

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\\n\\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : Here's the story. I (F) met this girl at college last semester. Let's call her Dani. I began talking to her because she started hanging out with some of my friends, after they met her at some student organization. Dani seemed nice, witty, smart, and was fun to hang out with. After a week or so, she added me on Facebook. After a month, Dani and I started opening up and talking about our hobbies, friends, and families both online and irl. One of the things that Dani got to know about me from our talks, was that my roommate and best friend, let's call him Vlad, lives with schizophrenia (this will be important later on). It seemed to me that she was an understanding, trustworthy person whom I could talk about a ton of things with. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward a few weeks and she starts complimenting me (frequently) on my hair, eyes, freckles, etc. I tried to seem oblivious to her advances, given that I wasn't attracted to her, I only thought she was a cool person that I had just met, whom I could maybe become good friends with. I thought that if I didn't compliment her back, she would figure out that I wasn't interested in her in *that* way. Besides, she hadn't said directly that she was interested in me, so I couldn't really 'reject' her. The only sort of obvious hint was that she had asked me a couple of times if I thought Vlad was handsome. Both times I replied something along the lines of ''Yeah, why not''. \\n\\n\\\\[By then, Dani knew how important Vlad is in my life, as I had talked to her about taking him to the ER when he started feeling sick (he's asthmatic), or about a sleepless night trying to calm him down a bit after he saw some frightening shadow-like being coming towards him (visual hallucinations)\\\\]. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHowever, Dani kept trying to make advances on me, without directly asking me out. I started to drop not-so-subtle hints that I was not interested in her (encouraging her to go on a date with that cute girl that she told me had asked her out) while also distancing myself from her, to avoid giving her mixed signals. I didn't ignore her messages nor ignored her in person. I just kept our conversations short and avoided talking about deeper subjects. \\n\\n**This is where Dani's odd behavior started.** One day, she hit me up on Facebook messenger with this message and a picture of a stuffed toy: ''*Hey, onesocktwobrains, guess what? I saw one of the campus counselors today, and I told her that I scream, shout at people and hit things out of nowhere, so she prescribed this toy to me, so I can bring it to class and hug it when I feel the need to scream or hit''.* It came across as strange to me that a therapist would prescribe stuffed toys for a 20 year-old to bring to college and hug, but ok. I just told Dani I hoped that this treatment plan would work well for her, without asking her for more details. The conversation ended there, but she pushed the topic whenever she could, and I just tried to brush it off.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThen, like a week or so later, Dani sends me a message that read: ''Are you free this Tuesday at 8? I need to talk to you about something. It's important''. I agreed to meet her at that time in campus, and turns out she wanted to talk to me about her feelings. Long story short, I told her I didn't feel the same way. She said that there were no hard feelings, and that she still wanted to keep talking to me. I made it clear that I think of her as a nice girl, but that I didn't want to be too close to her as friends either, that we were just too different (I didn't want to straight up tell her that I was a little creeped out and suspicious of her stuffed animal story).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn the coming months after that, we've been messaging back and forth, intermittently.  To clarify, she was the one to always initiate contact, except when I wave and say hi if I see her around campus. I don't want to be rude to her, because I see her as a nice person, but I also don't want to feed any sense of closeness between her and me. We make small talk via Facebook, and she seems overly interested in Vlad and how he is doing. She says she wants to meet him and hang out with him and me at our apartment. Everything seems innocuous but I feel something is off. Dani always turns the conversation around and makes it gravitate towards her *therapy stuffed animal*, her frequent urge to scream and kick out of nowhere (although my friends who hang out with her much more than me, told me they've never witnessed one of these episodes). And suddenly she has started speaking about allegedly having hallucinations too, just like Vlad.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nShortly after that (like two weeks ago), Dani got fed up with the college counselor because she wouldn't diagnose her with anything besides stress (her words). She eventually found a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with an anxiety disorder, and put her on meds. Since then, she makes sure to mention her meds every time she finds an opportunity. For example: I tell her that I'm stuck on traffic, and she replies that she can't drive because she's on meds. She sends me pictures of her prescription, to complain about how she can't find her meds at the pharmacy. I feel like she is pushing the topic on purpose, no matter how much I try to talk about something else. \\n\\n**Yesterday**, I got a bit too tired of it, and told her that I'm not qualified nor comfortable to give her advice about her condition, and that I would appreciate it if she stopped talking to me about her mental health, because I really don't think I can be of much help regarding that. She went bonkers and called me insensitive and selfish, among other things. She topped off her rant saying that she wasn't attracted to me anymore, as if that had something to do with the main issue. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRight now, I haven't replied to her messages. I don't even know what to make of the whole situation, given that I don't quite believe her stories of her screaming and kicking episodes, nor the tale of the therapeutic stuffed animal. It's also a big coincidence that she began having visual hallucinations shortly after learning that Vlad had them. She says she has psychosis even though the meds she was prescribed are for anxiety. I have also spoken to her closest friend from college and explained the situation to her, and she told me that Dani has never spoken to her about having these issues. Why would she share sensible information with me about her mental health but not with her closest friend?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI feel like an asshole for thinking she is faking mental illness in order to win my sympathy, but I'm starting to think this is the case. I really just want to ghost her without providing further explanation, because when I tried to explain how I felt with her oversharing, she just shifted the blame on me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: I feel like an asshole because I believe that a girl I met 4 months ago, who used to have a crush on me is faking mental illness to win my sympathy. My roommate and best friend has schizophrenia. I take care of him.

First, she says that a therapist prescribed a stuffed toy for her to bring with her to class so she could hug it when upset, which seems strange considering her age. Second, she told the author that an unnamed psychiatrist had diagnosed her with an unspecified anxiety disorder and put her on medication for it, but then said that she continued having hallucinations despite taking medication for anxiety. Third, the author states that they feel uncomfortable talking about mental illness because they are not qualified nor comfortable enough to give advice about mental health problems (the fact that Vlad lives with schizophrenia suggests that this is true). Fourth, Dani never mentioned any of these issues or symptoms in front of mutual friends; only in private discussions with the author did she mention them at all. Finally, after expressing discomfort at talking about mental health issues further and asking Dani not share such sensitive information with them again in the future, Dani became angry and called them selfish and insensitive without acknowledging how uncomfortable they felt discussing such matters (and without providing any explanation as to why such discussion would be necessary).\\\\nGiven all these facts from the post itself - including some indications from outside sources like mutual friends who have known both parties longer than four months - it seems likely enough (though not certain) given what we know here alone so far)that there may be something suspicious involved here regarding whether or not what DANI posts are true or even mostly true in terms of details (e.g., existence/nature/severity/accuracy much less frequency regarding original claims made by DANI during chats w/ OP as recounted by OP straight forwardly here), even though there may also be some truth mixed in too -- e.g., perhaps just parts of it were made up while other parts were truthful but exaggerated due especially w/r regard re: severity &amp; frequency etc./etc..

R.E.M.'s performance from their 2005 Dublin rehearsals was released on the live album Live at The Olympia and their 2008 performance from Austin City Limits appears on R.E.M. Live from Austin, TX.\\n Passage 2:A number of solar system objects that are mostly to completely invisible to the human eye are reasonably detectable with medium-size binoculars, including larger craters on the Moon; the dim outer planets Uranus and Neptune; the inner \\"minor planets\\" Ceres, Vesta and Pallas; Saturn's largest moon Titan; and the Galilean moons of Jupiter. Although visible unaided in pollution-free skies, Uranus and Vesta require binoculars for easy detection. 10×50 binoculars are limited to an apparent magnitude of +9.5 to +11 depending on sky conditions and observer experience. Asteroids like Interamnia, Davida, Europa and, unless under exceptional conditions Hygiea, are too faint to be seen with commonly sold binoculars. Likewise too faint to be seen with most binoculars are the planetary moons except the Galileans and Titan, and the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris. Other difficult binocular targets include the phases of Venus and the rings of Saturn. Only binoculars with very high magnification, 20x or higher, are capable of discerning Saturn's rings to a recognizable extent. High-power binoculars can sometimes show one or two cloud belts on the disk of Jupiter if optics and observing conditions are sufficiently good.\\n Passage 3:Ruth Mackenzie, CBE, (born July 1957) is artistic director of the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, and a former director of Holland Festival.

The detection of VEP abnormalities in Parkinson's disease was dependent on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus (a vertical square wave grating). The VEP latency was normal in Parkinsonian syndrome patients (except in one patient affected by familial Parkinsonism). Dopamine precursor therapy differently reduced the VEP latency, depending on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus. These findings suggest that the dopaminergic mechanism involved in the generation of VEP delays is sensitive to stimulus spatial frequency. The study of VEPs before and after the administration of haloperidol confirmed this hypothesis.

He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings.\\nThe Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.","target":"Alpha","rationale":"Based on the context, Bill observed Alpha and Beta. The large herd Alpha resided in an area with fewer resources while Herd Beta was a smaller group that grazed on an abundance of plants. In nature, when there are more individuals (larger population) competing for less food and other necessary resources some will die from starvation or lack of shelter. Therefore, since Alpha is larger than Beta it can be inferred that they had to compete harder for limited resources which resulted in many dying off as compared to their counterparts who were able to easily reproduce because they did not have competition over available sources due to being relatively small in number; hence why only “Alpha” matches up with the question asked: Which herd didn't have many resources available for each individual?"},{"source":"Given the background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades.

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants.

Sam insists, and he goes downstairs to check the basement for flooding. A flapping basement window suggests that the creature from the meteor has taken refuge in the cellar, and sure enough, when Sam goes into the basement, he is eaten by the bizarre monstrosity. Barb suffers the same fate when she goes down to see what happened to Sam; the creature corners her and viciously bites off her face.Aunt Millie is awakened by screaming, but she attributes it to the horror movie that Charles is watching on TV in his room.
