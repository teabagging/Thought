Cimetidine and ranitidine at 320 and 1000 micrograms/ml inhibited ACTH-stimulated corticosterone and cortisol synthesis and cimetidine decreased basal cortisol synthesis. The inhibitory effects of cimetidine on cortisol synthesis were approximately 10 times greater than those of ranitidine. Cimetidine (1000 micrograms/ml), but not ranitidine increased deoxycorticosterone synthesis by ACTH-stimulated cells, indicating inhibition of 11 beta-hydroxylation in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway.

Cassini was born at the Paris Observatory . Admitted at the age of seventeen to membership of the French Academy of Sciences , he was elected in 1696 a fellow of the Royal Society of London , and became maître des comptes in 1706 . Having succeeded to his father 's position at the observatory in 1712 , he measured in 1713 the arc of the meridian from Dunkirk to Perpignan , and published the results in a volume entitled Traité de la grandeur et de la figure de la terre ( 1720 ) . His two separate calculations for a degree of meridian arc were 57,097 toises de Paris ( 111.282 km ) and 57,061 toises ( 111.211 km ) , giving results for Earth 's radius of 3,271,420 toises ( 6,375.998 km ) and 3,269,297 toises ( 6,371.860 km ) , respectively . He also wrote Eléments d'astronomie ( 1740 ) , and died at Thury , near Clermont . He published the first tables of the satellites of Saturn in 1716 . The asteroid 24102 Jacquescassini is named after him . Jacques Cassini married Suzanne Françoise Charpentier de Charmois . Their second son was César - François Cassini de Thury who was known as Cassini III.\\n\\n- Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.\\n\\n- A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.\\n\\n- A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.\\n\\n- The County of Nice or Niçard Country (, Niçard ) is a historical region of France, located in the south-eastern part, around the city of Nice, and roughly equivalent to the modern department of Alpes-Maritimes.\\n\\n- An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.\\n\\n- Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.\\n\\n- Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol () represents the god's sickle.\\n\\n- From 1416 to 1860, the House of Savoy ruled the Duchy of Savoy (, German: \\"Savoyen\\"). The Duchy was a state in the northern part of the Italian Peninsula, with some territories that are now in France. It was a continuation of the County of Savoy. The duchy was a subject to the Holy Roman Empire, specifically its Upper Rhenish Circle.\\n\\n- Giovanni Domenico Cassini (8 June 1625  14 September 1712) was an Italian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer and engineer. Cassini was born in Perinaldo, near Imperia, at that time in the County of Nice, part of the Duchy of Savoy. Cassini is known for his work in the fields of astronomy and engineering. Cassini discovered four satellites of the planet Saturn and noted the division of the rings of Saturn; the Cassini Division was named after him. Giovanni Domenico Cassini was also the first of his family to begin work on the project of creating a topographic map of France.\\n\\n- Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'country of citizenship'.","target":"jacques cassini , france","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"jacques cassini , france\\"."},{"source":"You are given a conversation between two people.

That includes a $200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from $900,000 to $1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was $374,062, the report states. Newman also has a $5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf.

While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages.

Eighty-one (90%) did not require blood transfusion in the immediate postoperative period; nine patients received 16 units of blood, 6 of whom bled excessively; 2 were re-explored. Twelve had post-operative haemoglobins below 8.5 G/dl during their stay. They were transfused a total of 28 units of blood before discharge. Post-operative blood loss in the 9 transfused early averaged 894 +/- 176 ml (SEM). Loss from the not transfused patients averaged 481 +/- 18 ml (p less than 0.001). Patients transfused later had a mean loss of 510 +/- 36 ml (P NS). Sixty-nine patients were not transfused. Haemoglobin on the first post-operative day was 11.3 +/- 1.3 G/dl (SD). This declined to 10.2 +/- 1.2 G/dl on the fifth day. Discharge haemoglobin was 10.5 +/- 1.2 G/dl. Two patients died, one of myocardial infarction on the third day and the other of pancreatitis on the fourth. Both had had early blood transfusion. Haemoglobins were above 10 G/dl. Of the 69 untransfused patients 17% had supraventricular arrhythmias. Ten percent had serous wound discharges; 3 were infected. There were no sternal dehiscences.

Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.\\n\\nGranger causality is a widely-used criterion for analyzing interactions in large-scale networks. As most physical interactions are inherently nonlinear, we consider the problem of inferring the existence of pairwise Granger causality between nonlinearly interacting stochastic processes from their time series measurements. Our proposed approach relies on modeling the embedded nonlinearities in the measurements using a component-wise time series prediction model based on Statistical Recurrent Units (SRUs). We make a case that the network topology of Granger causal relations is directly inferrable from a structured sparse estimate of the internal parameters of the SRU networks trained to predict the processes’ time series measurements. We propose a variant of SRU, called economy-SRU, which, by design has considerably fewer trainable parameters, and therefore less prone to overfitting.

The docudrama covered the band's history between 1977 through 1986, recounting the trials and triumphs of Rick Allen and Steve Clark. 18 July broadcast still produced some of the channel's highest-ever ratings and is available on DVD.

The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 32.6 °F (0.3 °C); however, temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times per winter, and reach 50 °F (10 °C) several days each winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 °F (24.7 °C) in July and an average humidity level of 72%. Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, while daytime temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 °F (38 °C).

During this time, the Irish Confederate Wars  continued in Ireland, starting with the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and ending with the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Its incidents had little or no direct connection with those of the Civil War, but the wars were mixed with, and formed part of, a linked series of conflicts and civil wars between 1639 and 1652 in the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, which at that time shared a monarch, but were distinct states in political organisation.

As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed.\\nThese special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term.\\nAnother idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again.

After several years, Homer is very skillful and confident in performing obstetrical duties and Larch wants Homer to take over his position after he retires.

Homer is exempt from military service because Dr. Larch has diagnosed that he has a heart condition. While Wally is away, Homer and Candy have an affair. He goes to work picking apples with Arthur Rose's team. Arthur and his team are migrant workers who are employed seasonally at the orchard by the Worthingtons.

The rest of the population can be found every Sunday at their local garden center or DIY superstore. And when they want a break from caring about their own homes and gardens, they go on trips to visit bigger and better houses and gardens, such as the stately homes and gardens opened to the public by the National Trust and the Royal Horticulture Society. Visiting grand country houses always ranks as one of the most popular national pastimes.\\nQuestion: The passage mainly tells us about   _  .\\nOptions: A: why the English don't like social activities\\nB: how the English spend their leisure time\\nC: what the result of a recent census survey is\\nD: where the English hold their private activities","target":"B","rationale":"The passage mainly focuses on how the English spend their leisure time.

He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him.\\nI do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane.\\nUnder his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night.\\nWas my pledge to Nicolette a lie?\\nNo, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God.\\nHe had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited.

On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.\\n\\nParagraph: Marion county used coal and oil to produce electricity, while James county used nuclear energy for its electricity production.

Danny has gotten into some trouble with the law through two minor incidents (including shooting a deer), in her eyes innocent expressions of his natural curiosity and conscience rather than delinquency. Now with a third incident a judge orders her to send the boy to an Episcopal boarding school where Dr. Edward Hewitt (Richard Burton) is headmaster, and his wife Claire (Eva Marie Saint) teaches.At an initial interview, there is a momentary immediate attraction between Laura and Edward, but this quickly turns into tension brought on by their greatly differing world views and Laura's dislike of religion. Finally she storms out. She attempts to flee the area with her son but they are quickly picked up by police who take Danny to the school. He initially has trouble fitting in because his mother's home schooling has left him far in advance of boys his age in several subjects; the standard course of instruction at Edward's school leaves him restless and bored. At Claire's suggestion, Edward visits Laura to learn more about Danny and his upbringing.Laura's unconventional morals initially disturb Edward (such as modeling topless for an artist friend), as they conflict with his religious training. After visiting her several more times he finds that he wants her very much and cannot get her out of his mind. The two begin a torrid extramarital affair.

SUBJECTS 30 randomised controlled trials including 1419 randomised patients.   \\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Mortality from all causes at end of follow up for each trial.   \\n RESULTS For each patient category the risk of death in the albumin treated group was higher than in the comparison group. For hypovolaemia the relative risk of death after albumin administration was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 2.22), for burns the relative risk was 2.40 (1.11 to 5.19), and for hypoalbuminaemia it was 1.69 (1.07 to 2.67). Pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.68 (1.26 to 2.23). Pooled difference in the risk of death with albumin was 6% (95% confidence interval 3% to 9%) with a fixed effects model. These data suggest that for every 17 critically ill patients treated with albumin there is one additional death.   \\n CONCLUSIONS There is no evidence that albumin administration reduces mortality in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns, or hypoalbuminaemia and a strong suggestion that it may increase mortality. These data suggest that use of human albumin in critically ill patients should be urgently reviewed and that it should not be used outside the context of rigorously conducted, randomised controlled trials.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the objective of the study (\\"OBJECTIVE To quantify effect on mortality of administering human albumin or plasma protein fraction during management of critically ill patients.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague.

Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost.

When the tide turns against him, he dons a tunic and a womanish wig (spira), apparently part of the same costume, and thus enjoys a reprieve, although this attire may not itself have been considered effeminate as it was also worn by the priests of Mars of whom Gracchus was the chief priest. The change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent. It is unusual to see a gladiator depicted this way in a satire, as such fighters usually take the role of men who are \\"brawny, brutal, sexually successful with women of both high and low status, but especially the latter, ill-educated if not uneducated, and none too bright intellectually.\\" The retiarius tunicatus in the satire is the opposite: \\"a mock gladiatorial figure, of equivocal sex, regularly dressed in costume of some sort, possibly usually as a woman, and matched against a secutor or murmillo in a mock gladiatorial exhibition.\\"Despite their low status, some retiarii became quite popular throughout the early Empire. The fact that spectators could see net-fighters' faces humanised them and probably added to their popularity. At Pompeii, graffiti tells of Crescens or Cresces the retiarius, \\"lord of the girls\\" and \\"doctor to nighttime girls, morning girls, and all the rest.\\" Evidence suggests that some homosexual men fancied gladiators, and the retiarius would have been particularly appealing. Roman art depicts net-men just as often as other types. A mosaic found in 2007 in a bathhouse at the Villa dei Quintili shows a retiarius named Montanus. The fact that his name is recorded indicates that the gladiator was famous. The mosaic dates to c. CE 130, when the Quintilii family had the home built; the emperor Commodus, who fought in gladiatorial bouts as a secutor, acquired the house in CE 182 and used it as a country villa.

One theory is that the calendar came from mathematical operations based on the numbers thirteen and twenty, which were important numbers to the Maya. The numbers multiplied together equal 260.

This is close to the average number of days between the first missed menstrual period and birth, unlike Naegele's rule which is 40 weeks  between the last menstrual period and birth. It is postulated that midwives originally developed the calendar to predict babies' expected birth dates. A third theory comes from understanding of astronomy, geography and paleontology.

It consists of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins. The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings. The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles. In this way, it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules. In addition, cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion, ion conductivity and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures, including the cell wall, the carbohydrate layer called the glycocalyx, and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton.

A former Nimrod pilot , Burridge was in overall command of British forces under Operation Telic during the 2003 invasion of Iraq .\\n\\n- The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.\\n\\n- The 2003 invasion of Iraq lasted from 20 March to 1 May 2003 and signalled the start of the Iraq War, which was dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States (prior to 19 March, the mission in Iraq was called Operation Enduring Freedom, a carryover from the War in Afghanistan). The invasion consisted of 21 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded Iraq and deposed the Ba'athist government of Saddam Hussein. The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad by American forces with the implicit assistance of the United Kingdom alongside Australia and Poland.\\n\\n- Operation Telic (Op TELIC) was the codename under which all of the United Kingdom's military operations in Iraq were conducted between the start of the Invasion of Iraq on 19 March 2003 and the withdrawal of the last remaining British forces on 22 May 2011. The bulk of the mission ended on 30 April 2009 but around 150 troops, mainly from the Royal Navy, remained in Iraq until 22 May 2011 as part of the Iraqi Training and Advisory Mission. 46,000 troops were deployed at the onset of the invasion and the total cost of war stood at £9.24 billion in 2010.\\n\\n- Air chief marshal (Air Chf Mshl or ACM) is a four-star air officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force, where it is the most senior peacetime air force rank. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries that have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure.\\nAir chief marshal is a four-star air officer rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-9. An air chief marshal is equivalent to an admiral in the Royal Navy or a General in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent four-star rank is General.\\n\\n- The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.\\nFrom the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.\\n\\n- The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.\\n\\n- The Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 34 years of conflict. The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011 but left private security contractors in its place to continue the war. It again became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue.\\n\\n- Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) comprises several subordinate operations:\\n\\n- The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

I (20M) developed a \\"friendly\\" relationship with my gay manager (57M), let's call him GM. We met 2 years ago when I was struggling to find a part-time job during HS. I applied at his store (sportswear retail) and got in. I feel like GM always wanted me either as a love interest or just as a fuck-buddy...\\n\\nGM's parents died long ago, he only has 1 brother who neglected him up to recently because of his sexuality, never married or had any long-term relationships and is currently fighting a legal battle with his dead father's ex-wife who mind you is just a gold digging whore trying to take away half of his inheritance because she married him. However this this bitch is only 58 and married GM's father when he was 82 pretty much laying on his deathbed.\\n\\nAnyway, so I know GM has a somewhat tough life. He got into my personal space when his car had broken down and he had nobody willing to drop him off. He lived underway my route home, so I didn't mind dropping him off. I had been dropping him off for about 2 weeks until his mechanical problems got solved. In the meantime GM tried everything to steer conversations to personal things and break down barriers to get me into his personal life. I feel like he got attached to me and now that he knew me a bit more personally and wanted more than me being his acquaintance.\\n\\nEventually he was inviting me over for fancy dinners, giving me gifts, offering help to get me a better job (which he did, I got into a bank due to his contacts). I took them but didn't know how to feel, but took them anyway. I never gave it much thought, now I know whatever people do for you they most likely have ulterior motives.\\n\\nFast forward to today, I moved away for college and GM got an even better job at the government, this job however is very demanding and stressful. I'm back in town for a few weeks and GM found out so he tried reaching out to me. This time he invited me to dinner at his house and told me how everything was going for him in his life. His brother finally accepted him, however he just took his retirement, sold his house and is moving to Ecuador. 4 of his family members died during the holidays one after the other and he's still disputing the gold digging whore in court to keep his mother's house. I feel bad for GM because he's literally a lonely guy who's got a lot on his plate, but he's an adult, he should figure it out. GM Later mentions that he'd like to go to the beach on Saturday and would like me to accompany him. I'm currently on vacation and have nothing better to do and oblige to being of his company.\\n\\nToday GM calls and tells me, he's had a very rough week and wants to release himself, whatever that means. GM told me he wanted a man to take care of him and wants to go out for drinks, go to one of those uppity night clubs and just go all out for a night. \\" Just look after me and if I act stupid or try taking anybody home, stop me, and be on the lookout for if I have too many drinks.\\" I politely declined because I don't want to babysit this 57 year old gay man who will potentially get drunk out of his mind and wants me to take care of him for the night. Besides, I was already going to be spending most of my Saturday with this guy at the beach. GM didn't care, GM wanted, let me rephrase, expected me to be there and babysit him for a night out. He then tells me I'd never have gotten any of the opportunities I got in life if it wasn't because of him. Mentioning how he got me my one of my first jobs and lobbying hard enough to get me working in a bank. I told him I'm not interested, would rather stay home and just don't want to be fucking babysitting him. GM tried to coerce me, saying that turning him down would mean I'll be off his book and not going to see him anymore and that he will no longer be doing \\"nice things\\" for me. I don't even care if he wants me to see him, I don't care if I see him or don't, I was only there out of pity and now I couldn't care less about whatever happens to him.\\n\\n\\\\*Note:\\\\* I'm straight. I never went up to him asking for help. He offered himself all of the time. Now I know he's always been expecting something in return.\\n\\nTL/DR a 55 year old gay man gave me my first job when I was 18 and he did all he could to get me involved in his personal life. I sometimes hangout with him because he has a lot on his plate and I pity him. He wants me to go out with him for drinks and babysit him if he goes overboard with the booze. I told him I didn't want to and now he's claiming I never do anything for him and that he's done everything in his power to help me. If I don't oblige to babysitting him he will never again try to help me with anything in life and will push me out of his life.\\n\\nAm I The Asshole?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author describes a situation in which their manager has helped them with career opportunities and is now expecting something in return: the author's time.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan.

The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported.

It highlighted a medical mystery: why are some people more fit to handle the flu than others?\\nBritish and American researchers think they have a clue. Reporting on Sunday in the journal Nature, researchers say they've found a gene that influences our ability to fight against flu illness. The gene, called IFITM3, is the \\"important first line of defense\\" against the flu, researcher Paul Kellam of Britain's Sanger Institute told Reuters.\\nThe IFITM3 protein  prevents flu viruses from reproducing in cells. So, if you have a high amount of IFITM3, you're in luck, since it weakens the spread of the virus; a low amount can lead to more rapid viral reproduction, causing severe flu symptoms, according to Kellam.\\nScientists first found in gene studies that IFITM3 played a role in resistance to flu and other viruses. In experiments in mice, they showed that when mice were raised to lack the IFITM3 gene and then infected with influenza, the animals developed more severe lung infection from flu, compared with mice that had the gene.\\nTo figure out the role of IFTTM3 in humans, researchers then studied the IFITM3 genes of 53 patients with the flu in 2009-2010. They found that these patients were more likely to have a variant of the IFITM3 gene -- which makes people more vulnerable to flu -- compared with the general population. According to evidence from large genetic databases, about 1 in 400 people carries this IFITM3 variant, the BBC reports.\\n\\"Our research is important for people who have this variant as we predict their immune defenses could be weakened to some virus infections,\\" said Kellam.\\nThe Findings also suggest that a drug that functions as IFITM3 could help increase resistance to flu and other viruses, including deadly ones like H5N1 flu.\\nQuestion: Which of the following can serve as the best title of the passage?\\nAnswer:","target":"Why Flu Hits Some People Harder","rationale":"The article mentions that the same flu could cause severe symptoms in some people and mild symptoms in others.

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge. \\n\\nQuestion: What valley contains a river which rises over its banks each year?\\nI found this answer \\"Levees valley\\". Is that correct? Yes or no?","target":"No","rationale":"Levees are strips of sediments deposited near the water’s edge.

The second action involves accepting nudes from people who are not your significant other; this may be considered unethical depending on the context. For example, if someone sent you an unsolicited nude photo without asking for consent or permission first, it would be wrong and unethical to accept that nude photo without their consent because it violates their privacy and shows disrespect for their wishes regarding how their body should be treated (i.e., showing respect for bodily autonomy). On the other hand, if the person sending you a nude photo asked for your consent before sending it to you and then gave that consent before sharing a nude photograph with you (i.e., they have accepted responsibility), then it would not necessarily be unethical to accept that photograph since both parties have agreed on how they want to handle such matters (i.e., both parties have shown respect for each other's bodily autonomy).

Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion.

Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were \\"#$%_&'() –  early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead, but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII !\\"#$% were placed in second column, rows 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters left, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9. This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards, notably the Teletype Model 33, which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the more recently introduced IBM Selectric (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers—​​following the IBM PC (1981), especially Model M (1984)—​​and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The /? pair also dates to the No. 2, and the ,< .> pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift , (comma) or . (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the ;: pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly -* =+) to :* ;+ -=.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"non-alphanumeric characters","rationale":"ASCII is an acronym that stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling.\\nThis is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat.\\nScientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone  levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling.\\n\\"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature.

Here, he sacrificed his hand to save his infant son from being killed in a plot against his life by his evil brother Orm; Aquaman and his son were chained to a rock that was falling towards an underwater magma flow, and Aquaman only had time to free his right arm from his chains before cutting off his left hand to escape his remaining bonds.

He is known for his operas, which include Der Rosenkavalier, Elektra, Die Frau ohne Schatten and Salome; his Lieder, especially his Four Last Songs; his tone poems, including Don Juan, Death and Transfiguration, Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, Also sprach Zarathustra, Ein Heldenleben, Symphonia Domestica, and An Alpine Symphony; and other instrumental works such as Metamorphosen and his Oboe Concerto. Strauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire.\\n\\nStrauss was born on 11 June 1864 in Munich, the son of Josephine (nee Pschorr) and Franz Strauss, who was the principal horn player at the Court Opera in Munich. In his youth, he received a thorough musical education from his father. He wrote his first composition at the age of six, and continued to write music almost until his death.  During his boyhood Strauss attended orchestra rehearsals of the Munich Court Orchestra (now the Bavarian State Orchestra), where he received private instruction in music theory and orchestration from an assistant conductor. In 1872, he started receiving violin instruction at the Royal School of Music from Benno Walter, his father's cousin. In 1874, Strauss heard his first Wagner operas, Lohengrin and Tannhauser. The influence of Wagner's music on Strauss's style was to be profound, but at first his musically conservative father forbade him to study it. Indeed, in the Strauss household, the music of Richard Wagner was viewed with deep suspicion, and it was not until the age of 16 that Strauss was able to obtain a score of Tristan und Isolde. In later life, Strauss said that he deeply regretted the conservative hostility to Wagner's progressive works. Nevertheless, Strauss's father undoubtedly had a crucial influence on his son's developing taste, not least in Strauss's abiding love for the horn.  In early 1882, in Vienna, he gave the first performance of his Violin Concerto in D minor, playing a piano reduction of the orchestral part himself, with his teacher Benno Walter as soloist. The same year he entered Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he studied philosophy and art history, but not music. He left a year later to go to Berlin, where he studied briefly before securing a post as assistant conductor to Hans von Bulow, who had been enormously impressed by the young composer's Serenade for wind instruments, composed when he was only 16 years of age. Strauss learned the art of conducting by observing Bulow in rehearsal. Bulow was very fond of the young man, and decided that Strauss should be his successor as conductor of the Meiningen Court Orchestra when Bulow resigned in 1885. Strauss's compositions at this time were indebted to the style of Robert Schumann or Felix Mendelssohn, true to his father's teachings. His Horn Concerto No. 1, Op. 11, is representative of this period and is a staple of the modern horn repertoire.  Strauss married soprano Pauline de Ahna on 10 September 1894. She was famous for being irascible, garrulous, eccentric and outspoken, but to all appearances the marriage was essentially happy, and she was a great source of inspiration to him. Throughout his life, from his earliest songs to the final Four Last Songs of 1948, he preferred the soprano voice to all others, and all his operas contain important soprano roles.  The Strausses had one son, Franz, in 1897. Franz married Alice von Grab-Hermannsworth, daughter of a Jewish industrialist, in a Roman Catholic ceremony in 1924. Franz and Alice had two sons, Richard and Christian.

Why should money, time and effort be spent exploring and researching something with so few obvious benefits? Why should resources be spent on space rather than on conditions and people on Earth? These are questions that, understandably, are very often asked. Perhaps the best answer lies in our genetic makeup as human beings. What drove our ancestors to move from the trees into the plains, and on into all possible areas and environments? The wider the spread of a species, the better its chance of survival. Perhaps the best reason for exploring space is this genetic tendency to expand wherever possible. Nearly every successful civilization has explored, because by doing so, any dangers in surrounding areas can be identified and prepared for. Without knowledge, we may be completely destroyed by the danger. With knowledge, we can lessen its effects. Exploration also allows minerals and other potential resources to be found. Even if we have no immediate need of them, they will perhaps be useful later. Resources may be more than physical possessions . Knowledge or techniques have been gained through exploration. The techniques may have medical applications which can improve the length or quality of our lives. We have already benefited from other spin-offs including improvements in earthquake prediction, in satellites for weather forecasting and in communications systems. Even non-stick pans and mirrored sunglasses are by-products of technological developments in the space industry! While many resources are spent on what seems a small return, the exploration of space allows creative, brave and intelligent members of our species to focus on what may serve to save us. While space may hold many wonders and explanations of how the universe was formed or how it works, it also holds dangers. The danger exists, but knowledge can help human being to survive. Without the ability to reach out across space, the chance to save ourselves might not exist.

Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied.\\nThe subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87.

After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again.\\nDenton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink.  His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs.

Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace.\\nPleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey.  At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse.

When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color.

In the second scenario, a woman at a family picnic is trying to decide what dress she should wear due to expected hot temperatures that day.\\nEach scenario gives context regarding how dark and light colored clothes can affect how much energy (represented by heat) they store when exposed to sunlight. Darker colors tend to hold onto energy longer than lighter colors do.

They rely on their well-developed sonar to find their way in the water. Toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted. All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure. Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and beaked whales (ziphiids). There are six species, sometimes referred to as \\"blackfish\\", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).The differences between families of odontocetes include size, feeding adaptations and distribution.\\nMonodontids consist of two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both reside in the frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their coloration acting as camouflage.

One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle.\\nWhen the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished.

Vienna saw it for the first time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as \\"an awkwardly updated production\\", though well performed. The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the \\"melodic suppleness and warmth\\" of Bizet's score.San Diego Opera first staged the work in 1993, but it was this company's 2004 production, designed by Zandra Rhodes, that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States. In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses; in October 2008 James C. Whitson, in Opera News, reported that worldwide, \\"between 2007 and 2009, half of all major production of the piece have been or will be ... in the U.S.\\". San Diego's director, Ian Campbell, suggested that his company's 2004 production was \\"created at a time when it seemed many U.S. opera companies were looking for a not-too-expensive production with melody, and a little off the beaten track .... [Our] Les pêcheurs de perles fitted the bill.\\nIn January 2008 the opera received its first performance in Sri Lanka, the land of its setting.

It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceutical drugs, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called \\"gelatinous\\". Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen, wherein the hydrolysis results in the reduction of protein fibrils into smaller peptides, which will have broad molecular weight ranges associated with physical and chemical methods of denaturation, based on the process of hydrolysis. It is found in most gummy candy, as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin desserts, and some ice creams, dips, and yogurts. Gelatin for recipe use comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.\\n\\n- The peanut, also known as the groundnut and the goober and taxonomically classified as Arachis hypogaea, is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both small and large commercial producers. It is classified as both a grain legume and, because of its high oil content, an oil crop. World annual production of shelled peanuts was 42 million tonnes in 2014.

A filbert is more elongated, being about twice as long as its diameter. The nut falls out of the husk when ripe, about 7 to 8 months after pollination. The kernel of the seed is edible and used raw or roasted, or ground into a paste. The seed has a thin, dark brown skin, which is sometimes removed before cooking.\\n\\n- White bread typically refers to breads made from wheat flour from which the bran and the germ layers have been removed (and set aside) from the whole wheatberry as part of the flour grinding or milling process, producing a light-colored flour. This milling process can give white flour a longer shelf life by removing the natural oils from the whole grain. Removing the oil allows products made with the flour, like white bread, to be stored for longer periods of time avoiding potential rancidity.\\n\\n- Althaea officinalis (marsh-mallow, marsh mallow, or common marshmallow) is a perennial species indigenous to Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa, which is used as a medicinal plant and ornamental plant.

The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices.

The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited with the idea of climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.\\nWhat is the answer to this question: What is the term for the most complex plant life in a specific environment?","target":"climax vegetation","rationale":"The text talks about the composition of plant communities and their development using ecological succession.

They were written by mystics, who expressed their devotion to God in simple poems that could appeal to the masses.

This is an example of an early encyclopedia in Sanskrit covering many subjects including medicine, magic, veterinary science, valuing of precious stones and pearls, fortifications, painting, music, games, amusements etc. While the book does not give any of dealt topics particular hierarchy of importance, it serves as a landmark in understanding the state of knowledge in those subjects at that time.

Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock.

Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.\\n\\n- A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.\\n\\n- Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain.

Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.\\n\\n- Bloc Party are an English indie rock band, currently composed of Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, sampler), Russell Lissack (lead guitar, keyboards), Justin Harris (bass guitar, keyboards, saxophones, backing vocals) and Louise Bartle (drums, percussion).

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'many of horror' exhibits the relationship of 'record label'.

They rely on their well-developed sonar to find their way in the water. Toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted. All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure. Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and beaked whales (ziphiids). There are six species, sometimes referred to as \\"blackfish\\", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).The differences between families of odontocetes include size, feeding adaptations and distribution.\\nMonodontids consist of two species: the beluga and the narwhal.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: Force is defined as a push or a pull acting on an object. Examples of forces include friction and gravity. Both are covered in detail later in this chapter. Another example of force is applied force. It occurs when a person or thing applies force to an object, like the girl pushing the swing in Figure 13.1. The force of the push causes the swing to move. Force is a vector because it has both size and direction. For example, the girl in Figure 13.1 is pushing the swing away from herself. Thats the direction of the force. She can give the swing a strong push or a weak push. Thats the size, or strength, of the force. Like other vectors, forces can be represented with arrows. Figure 13.2 shows some examples. The length of each arrow represents the strength of the force, and the way the arrow points represents the direction of the force. How could you use an arrow to represent the girls push on the swing in Figure 13.1? The SI unit of force is the newton (N). One newton is the amount of force that causes a mass of 1 kilogram to accelerate at 1 m/s2 . Thus, the newton can also be expressed as kgm/s2 . The newton was named for the scientist Sir Isaac Newton, who is famous for his law of gravity. Youll learn more about Sir Isaac Newton later in the chapter. More than one force may act on an object at the same time. In fact, just about all objects on Earth have at least two forces acting on them at all times. One force is gravity, which pulls objects down toward the center of Earth. The other force is an upward force that may be provided by the ground or other surface. Consider the example in Figure 13.3. A book is resting on a table. Gravity pulls the book downward with a force of 20 newtons. At the same time, the table pushes the book upward with a force of 20 newtons. The combined forces acting on the book or any other object are called the net force. This is the overall force acting on an object that takes into account all of the individual forces acting on the object. You can learn more about the concept of net force at this URL: . When two forces act on an object in opposite directions, like the book on the table, the net force is equal to the difference between the two forces. In other words, one force is subtracted from the other to calculate the net force. If the opposing forces are equal in strength, the net force is zero. Thats what happens with the book on the table. The upward force minus the downward force equals zero (20 N up - 20 N down = 0 N). Because the forces on the book are balanced, the book remains on the table and doesnt move. In addition to these downward and upward forces, which generally cancel each other out, forces may push or pull an object in other directions. Look at the dogs playing tug-of-war in Figure 13.4. One dog is pulling on the rope with a force of 10 newtons to the left. The other dog is pulling on the rope with a force of 12 newtons to the right. These opposing forces are not equal in strength, so they are unbalanced. When opposing forces are unbalanced, the net force is greater than zero. The net force on the rope is 2 newtons to the right, so the rope will move to the right. Two forces may act on an object in the same direction. You can see an example of this in Figure 13.5. After the man on the left lifts up the couch, he will push the couch to the right with a force of 25 newtons. At the same time, the man to the right is pulling the couch to the right with a force of 20 newtons. When two forces act in the same direction, the net force is equal to the sum of the forces.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman.

Passage 1:Through his involvement with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, general manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at Westminster Underground station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.\\n Passage 2:Of those Phillies, 97 have had surnames beginning with the letter R.

The Hall of Fame lists the Phillies as Roberts' primary team; during his career, the right-hander won 234 games and lost 199, the latter one of his three franchise records. During his 14 seasons with the team, he pitched 3,739  innings and completed 272 games, both records; he also held the major league record for most career home runs allowed until it was broken in 2010. Roberts was also elected to the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame as the Phillies' first inductee in 1978.\\n Passage 3:Williams started his footballing career at his local club Cradley Town in 1990. After impressing in the lower leagues he attracted the attention of Football League sides and joined Welsh side Swansea City in 1991. After having a decent season with Swansea he move on up to Coventry City the following season. He spent three years with the sky blues making 80 league appearances, the most he would acquire in his career. Williams' early goal against Middlesbrough on 15 August 1992 was only the second goal ever scored in the newly formed FA Premiership (the goal came in the ninth minute of the game which was approximately four minutes after Brian Deane's goal against Manchester United on the opening day of the new season). Whilst at Coventry Williams had loan spells at Notts County, Stoke City and at his old club Swansea City. He left Coventry in 1995 and joined new league side Wycombe Wanderers to start a somewhat nomadic career. After two years with the chairboys he moved on to unsuccessful spells at Hereford United and Walsall. Williams then went on to have a new club every season starting with Exeter City in the 1997–98 season. He went on to play for Cardiff City, York City, Darlington, two seasons with Swansea City his third spell at the club and his final Football League side Kidderminster Harriers.

He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased.

Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make long-term investments despite the current slump in the technology business. \\"To play to win in technology, you innovate and you lead,\\" he said. But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than $2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations. But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \\"I need more capacity in that end of the market,\\" he said, \\"and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\\" If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings.

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.

The point to involve people with various backgrounds was to show that there was a focus on finance, marketing, and also on a design and functionality, right from the start of the product-development process.

The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt.

Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.\\n\\nEven though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding.

Factory label, Out of the Ashes. \\"Out of the Ashes\\" was Colter's first studio album in over 20 years. The album was produced by Don Was and reflected on Jennings' death. Jennings had an unused vocal, \\"Out of the Rain,\\" which was featured on the track.  The album was given many positive reviews, including Allmusic, which gave the album four out of five stars in 2006. Out of the Ashes was her first album since 1981 to chart on the Top Country Albums chart, peaking at No. 61. In 2007 Colter recorded a duet version of her 1975 hit \\"I'm Not Lisa\\" with Deana Carter on her 2007 album, The Chain.  In 2017, Colter and Jan Howard provided guest vocals to a track appearing on Written In Song, an album by Jeannie Seely. The song, called \\"We're Still Hangin' In There Ain't We Jessi\\", references how Seely and Colter are seemingly two of the only women in country music who managed to have a successful marriage.  Colter's first album in eleven years, The Psalms was released on March 24 via Legacy Recordings. The album consisted of Colter's favourite Book of Psalms passages put to music and was produced by Lenny Kaye, who recalled an evening when he, Colter, Jennings and Patti Smith were having dinner together in 1995 when Colter began to sing passages of the Bible. Kaye stated that he was \\"transfixed\\" and kept the evening in his mind until he convinced Colter to record those renditions in 2007, with the album being recorded over the course of two sessions, along with a further two in 2008. Of the album, Kate stated that \\"we tried to choose songs that weren't about warring peoples but more about comfort and reconciliation\\".

For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family.\\nThat night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved.

Although variations in the spelling of Guild's Lake occur in historic newspapers, maps, and other documents, Guild's Lake has been the preferred form since the beginning of the 20th century.The creek is named for Danford Balch, who settled a 346-acre (1.40 km2) donation land claim upstream of the Guild property in 1850. After a man from a neighboring family eloped with a Balch daughter, Balch killed him with a shotgun. On October 17, 1859, at a public gallows he became the first person to be hanged by the State of Oregon.Macleay Park takes its name from Donald Macleay, a Portland merchant and real-estate developer who  acquired what had been the Balch property. In 1897, he donated the land for a park on condition that the city provide transport to the park for hospital patients and build paths wide enough for wheelchairs.","target":"Danford","rationale":"The question asks us to identify the first name of a man whose property was acquired by Macleay. Because there are several sentences in this passage that reference land acquisitions, it is important to look closely at each sentence and pay attention to details. The second paragraph tells us that Guild purchased nearly 600 acres through a donation claim, but does not mention his given name or how he spelled his surname. A search for \\"Guild\\" as an answer will return incorrect results.\\nParagraphs three and four detail two separate men who settled on Balch Creek: Danford Balch (last paragraph) killed another man over an elopement between their families; Donald Macleay gained title to what had been the Balch family's property after Danford was hanged (middle paragraph).
