This chapter focuses (1) on the histological sequelae of disturbed reproductive endocrinology in rat, dog and nonhuman primates and (2) provides a review of our current understanding of the roles of gonadotropins and androgens. The response of the rodent testis to endocrine disturbances is clearly different from that of dog and primates with different germ cell types and spermatogenic stages being affected initially and also that the end-stage spermatogenic involution is more pronounced in dog and primates compared to rodents. Luteinizing hormone (LH)/testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are the pivotal endocrine factors controlling testicular functions. The relative importance of either hormone is somewhat different between rodents and primates. Generally, however, both LH/testosterone and FSH are necessary for quantitatively normal spermatogenesis, at least in non-seasonal species.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not include a topic sentence that states the main idea of the paper.

Two hundred forty-one patients with dilation of 271 coronary sites were randomized at the time of hospital discharge to receive nifedipine, 10 mg (123 patients), or placebo (118 patients) four times daily for 6 months. No patient was known to have coronary artery spasm. The mean duration of therapy was 4.4 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) months for nifedipine and 4.3 +/- 2 months for placebo. A restudy angiogram was available in 100 patients (81%) in the nifedipine group and 98 patients (83%) in the placebo group. A recurrent coronary stenosis was noted in 28% of patients in the nifedipine group and in 29.5% of those in the placebo group (p = NS). The mean diameter stenosis was 36.4 +/- 23% for the nifedipine group and 36.7 +/- 23% for the placebo group (p = NS). By pill count, 78% of patients receiving nifedipine and 82% of those receiving placebo complied with the study drug regimen. Coronary stenosis recurred in 33% of patients in the placebo group and in 29% of patients in the nifedipine group who complied with the regimen and had angiograms (p = NS).

His imagination ran wild with thoughts of kissing her full lips while his hands explored her lean, muscled body. Tonight he didn't need the whiskey to warm him up. But he kept drinking it anyway. She stepped away from the mike, sat her acoustic guitar on its stand, and walked down from the small stage. Jason beat all the other losers to the bar and sat down beside her. \\"You must be pretty thirsty after all that beautiful singing.\\" How many times had she heard that line?

Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although   on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\".\\nThere is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the  music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

Passage:After shakedown along the U.S. East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico, Jack Miller sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, 13 June 1944, arriving Pearl Harbor 12 July via the Panama Canal Zone and San Diego, California. After more intensive training out of Pearl Harbor, she departed on 24 July screening a convoy to Eniwetok, where she arrived on 2 August. The remainder of the month was spent on patrol and convoy duty. Jack Miller sailed from Eniwetok on 2 September and, after escorting a convoy to Saipan, took up harbor patrol duty there. Antisubmarine patrols, convoy screening, and escort duty kept Jack Miller busy for the next nine months. During this period she sank five mines. In late 1944 Jack Miller came under the command of Lt. Commander Vermont C. Royster; he had served as the White House correspondent of The Wall Street Journal before the war. After the war ended, Lt.

A colander is also used to rinse vegetables.\\n\\n- A food mill ( also called passatutto , purée sieve , moulinette , mouli légumes , or passe - vite ) is a food preparation utensil for mashing and sieving soft foods . Typically , a food mill consists of three parts : a bowl , a bottom plate with holes like those in a colander , and a crank fitted with a bent metal blade which crushes the food and forces it through the holes in the bottom plate as the crank is turned . The bottom plate may be a permanent part of the device , or interchangeable plates with different hole sizes may be supplied . Three corrugated feet on the base , or two ears on the rim plus the handle , fit on the rim of a cooking pot and hold the mill in position over it . Food mills are usually made of stainless steel or aluminum . The bowl may be plastic , particularly for smaller sizes marketed for preparing baby food . Older \`\` heirloom '' utensils were usually made from tinplate . This piece of kitchen equipment , of long - proven efficiency , bridges the gap between a sieve ( or tamis , china cap , or chinoise ) and the electric blender or food processor . Its function is similar to that of a potato ricer or \`\` hob '' type of spätzle maker . Uses of a food mill include removing the seeds from cooked tomatoes , removing pulp or larger pieces from foods ( creating apple jelly or any type of purée ) , and making mashed potatoes or spätzle . A metal sieve used with a wooden spoon or pestle may be found more effective for puréeing fibrous foodstuffs such as marmalade oranges .\\n\\n- Fat is one of the three main macronutrients, along with carbohydrate and protein. Fats, also known as triglycerides, are esters of three fatty acid chains and the alcohol glycerol.\\n\\n- A carbohydrate is a biological molecule consisting of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogenoxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water); in other words, with the empirical formula (where \\"m\\" could be different from \\"n\\"). Some exceptions exist; for example, deoxyribose, a sugar component of DNA, has the empirical formula CHO. Carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon; structurally it is more accurate to view them as polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones.\\n\\n- In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.\\n\\n- A sieve, or sifter, is a device for separating wanted elements from unwanted material or for characterizing the particle size distribution of a sample, typically using a woven screen such as a mesh or net or metal. The word \\"sift\\" derives from \\"sieve\\". In cooking, a sifter is used to separate and break up clumps in dry ingredients such as flour, as well as to aerate and combine them. A strainer is a form of sieve used to separate solids from liquid.\\n\\n- A vitamin is an organic compound and a vital nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, and it must be obtained through the diet; thus, the term \\"vitamin\\" is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animal organisms. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.\\n\\n- Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.\\n\\n- Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- A nutrient is a component in foods that an organism uses to survive and grow. Macronutrients provide the bulk energy an organism's metabolic system needs to function while micronutrients provide the necessary cofactors for metabolism to be carried out. Both types of nutrients can be acquired from the environment. Micronutrients are used to build and repair tissues and to regulate body processes while macronutrients are converted to, and used for, energy. Methods of nutrient intake are different for plants and animals. Plants take in nutrients directly from the soil through their roots and from the atmosphere through their leaves. Animals and protists have specialized digestive systems that work to break down macronutrients for energy and utilize micronutrients for both metabolism and anabolism (constructive synthesis) in the body.\\n\\n- Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'food mill' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of'.

He is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992). Carson received six Emmy Awards, the Television Academy's 1980 Governor's Award, and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987.\\n\\nOn May 1, 1972, the show was moved from Thirty Rockefeller Plaza, New York, to Burbank, California, because of the studio's proximity to the celebrities. Carson often joked about \\"beautiful downtown Burbank\\" and referred to \\"beautiful downtown Bakersfield\\", which prompted Bakersfield Mayor Mary K. Shell to chide Carson and invite him to her city to see improvements made during the early 1980s.  From July 1971, Carson stopped hosting five shows per week. Instead, Mondays featured a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four weeknights. Shows were videotaped in Burbank at 5:30 pm, fed from there to the Central and Eastern time zone stations via cross-country television line at 8:30 pm Pacific time (11:30 pm Eastern time), and later sent from Burbank to the Pacific time zone stations at 11:30 pm Pacific time. Since only two feeds originated from Burbank, Central time zone stations received the Eastern feed one hour earlier at 10:30 pm local time, and Mountain time stations received the Pacific time zone feed one hour later at 12:30 am local time.  In 1980, at Carson's request, the show cut its 90-minute format to 60 minutes on September 16; Tom Snyder's Tomorrow added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. Joan Rivers became the \\"permanent\\" guest host from September 1983 until 1986. The Tonight Show returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comic George Carlin. Jay Leno then became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987. Leno joked that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for The Best of Carson--rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s.  Although Carson's work schedule became more attenuated, Tonight remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about $4 million a year ($15,008,000 today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses.

Stimuli are of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and macromolecules that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light. For humans, the only electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other organisms have receptors that humans lack, such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds. Receptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. Chemical stimuli can be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object’s taste or smell. Osmoreceptors respond to solute concentrations of body fluids. Additionally, pain is primarily a chemical sense that interprets the presence of chemicals from tissue damage, or similar intense stimuli, through a nociceptor. Physical stimuli, such as pressure and vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor. Another physical stimulus that has its own type of receptor is temperature, which is sensed through a thermoreceptor that is either sensitive to temperatures above (heat) or below (cold) normal body temperature.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- chemical\\n\\n- atmospheric\\n\\n- thermal\\n\\n- physical\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"physical","rationale":"Among the provided answers, only physical is a type of stimulus.

Expanding knowledge about the natural history and prognosis of cancers positions oncologists to advise patients regarding the risk of second malignancies and treatment-related cancers. In addition, as recognized experts in the full spectrum of cancer care, oncologists are afforded opportunities for involvement in community-based cancer prevention activities. Although oncologists are currently providing many cancer prevention and risk assessment services to their patients, economic barriers exist, including inadequate or lack of insurance, that may compromise uniform patient access to these services. Additionally, insufficient reimbursement for existing and developing interventions may discourage patient access to these services. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the medical society representing cancer specialists involved in patient care and clinical research, is committed to supporting oncologists in their wide-ranging involvement in cancer prevention. This statement on risk assessment and prevention counseling, although not intended to be a comprehensive overview of cancer prevention describes the current role of oncologists in risk assessment and prevention; provides examples of risk assessment and prevention activities that should be offered by oncologists; identifies potential opportunities for coordination between oncologists and primary care physicians in prevention education and coordination of care for cancer survivors; describes ASCO's involvement in education and training of oncologists regarding prevention; and proposes improvement in the payment environment to encourage patient access to these services..

By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s.

The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit.

It is an off - white powder at room temperature and has the chemical formula Li2TiO3 . It is the anode component of the fast recharging lithium - titanate battery . It is also used as an additive in porcelain enamels and ceramic insulating bodies based on titanates . It is frequently utilized as a flux due to its good stability . In recent years , along with other Lithium ceramics , metatitanate pebbles have been the subject of research efforts towards tritium breeding materials in nuclear fusion applications .\\n\\n- Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red.\\nAlthough many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger.\\n\\n- Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.\\n\\n- Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium.\\n\\n- Corrosion is a natural process, which converts a refined metal to a more chemically-stable form, such as its oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide. It is the gradual destruction of materials (usually metals) by chemical and/or electrochemical reaction with their environment. Corrosion engineering is the field dedicated to controlling and stopping corrosion.\\n\\n- Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine.\\n\\n- The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is  (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:\\n\\n- An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.\\n\\n- In chemistry, the term transition metal (or transition element) has three possible meanings:\\n\\n- In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.\\n\\n- Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge  a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals.\\n\\n- Lithium (from , \\"stone\\") is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, appears only in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\n\\n- Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.\\n\\n- Lithium chloride is a chemical compound with the formula LiCl. The salt is a typical ionic compound, although the small size of the Li ion gives rise to properties not seen for other alkali metal chlorides, such as extraordinary solubility in polar solvents (83.05 g/100 mL of water at 20 °C) and its hygroscopic properties.\\n\\n- A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- The alkali metals are a group (column) in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.\\n\\n- A mineral oil or paraffin oil is any of various colorless, odorless, light mixtures of higher alkanes from a mineral source, particularly a distillate of petroleum.\\n\\n- A metal (from Greek  \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable  that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking  as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'lithium titanate' and 'chemical compound'?","target":"instance of","rationale":"The relationship between \\"lithium titanate\\" and \\"chemical compound\\" is that of the instance of. \\nLithium titanate (full name lithium metatitanate) is a chemical compound containing lithium and titanium, while chemical compounds are substances formed by combining two or more different types of elements.\\""},{"source":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: \\n\\nQ: People want to go on vacation.

Sand, the ocean, lots of sunlight. You may also find shells. The shells you find are most likely left by organisms in the phylum Mollusca. On the beach, you can find the shells of many different mollusks ( Figure 1.1), including clams, mussels, scallops, oysters, and snails. Mollusks are invertebrates that usually have a hard shell, a mantle, and a radula. Their glossy pearls, mother of pearl, and abalone shells are like pieces of jewelry. Some mollusks, such as squid and octopus, do not have shells. The Mollusks body is often divided into different parts ( Figure 1.2): On the beach, you can find a wide variety of mollusk shells. 1. A head with eyes or tentacles. 2. In most species, a muscular foot, which helps the mollusk move. Some mollusks use the foot for burrowing into the sand, and others use it for jet-propulsion. 3. A mantle, or fold of the outer skin lining the shell. The mantle often releases calcium carbonate, which creates an external shell, just like the ones you find on the beach. The shell is made of chitin, a tough, semitransparent substance. 4. A mass housing the organs. 5. A complete digestive tract that begins at the mouth and runs to the anus. 6. Most ocean mollusks have a gill or gills to absorb oxygen from the water. 7. Many species have a feeding structure, the radula, found only in mollusks. The radula can be thought of as a \\"tongue-like\\" structure. The radula is made mostly of chitin. Types of radulae range from structures used to scrape algae off of rocks to the beaks of squid and octopuses. This is the basic body plan of a mollusk. Note the mantle, gills, and radula. Keep in mind the basic body plan can differ slightly among the mollusks. Mollusks are probably most closely related to organisms in the phylum Annelida, also known as segmented worms. This phylum includes the earthworm and leech. Scientists believe these two groups are related because, when they are in the early stage of development, they look very similar. Mollusks also share features of their organ systems with segmented worms. Unlike segmented worms, however, mollusks do not have body segmentation.

His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune.  It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440.  Furthermore,  when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from écorcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s.  The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages.\\nIn the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily.  Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,...","target":"Philip","rationale":"The text mentions that Nicolas Rolin was the Chancellor of Burgundy from 1422 to 1455.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.\\n\\n- Matija Klukovi (born May 4, 1982 in Zagreb, Croatia) is a young Croatian independent film director.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.","target":"more","rationale":"Molly is having trouble reading the writing on her chalkboard.

Sean signed with Kanye West's GOOD Music in 2007, Def Jam Recordings in 2008 and Roc Nation in 2014. After releasing a number of mixtapes, Sean released his debut studio album, Finally Famous, in 2011. He released his second studio album, Hall of Fame, in 2013.\\n\\nIn an interview on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, Sean discussed the role Kanye West and No I.D. have had in the development of his first studio album's sonic direction as well as the challenges of being inside the studio with West. The album's lead single, \\"My Last\\", features vocals from Chris Brown and was produced by No I.D. According to Amazon.com, Big Sean's Finally Famous was delayed by a week, with a tentative release date set for June 28. Big Sean has revealed the cover art for his G.O.O.D. Music debut and explained that the one-week pushback was to be blamed on sample and feature clearance issues. The official track list was revealed on June 7.  Finally Famous, Sean's debut studio album, was released June 28, 2011, and spawned three hit singles; \\"My Last\\", \\"Marvin & Chardonnay\\" and \\"Dance (Ass)\\". The album featured guest appearances from Lupe Fiasco, John Legend, Pharrell, Kanye West, Roscoe Dash, Wiz Khalifa, Chiddy Bang, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, Pusha T, and included production from No I.D., The Legendary Traxster, Andrew \\"Pop\\" Wansel, Xaphoon Jones and The Neptunes. When the songs \\"O.T.T.R.\\" and \\"Flowers\\" were leaked in July 2011, speculation began of a new mixtape. Sean confirmed in an interview June 28, 2011 that a collaborative mixtape between him and \\"two other guys in hip-hop that are just killing it right now\\" will be released \\"in a couple of weeks\\". Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y, were the suspected featured rappers on the mixtape. However, Wiz Khalifa later confirmed that there would be no mixtape, claiming that the songs were created, \\"just for fun\\".  In September 2011, Big Sean confirmed in an interview with the Daily Tribune that he'll be working on his second album during the I Am Finally Famous Tour and plans to release the album sometime in 2012. On October 19, 2011, Kanye West announced on his Twitter plans for a Spring 2012 GOOD Music album release. On April 6, 2012, \\"Mercy\\", the lead single from the GOOD Music compilation album, Cruel Summer, was released. The song, produced by newly signed in-house producer Lifted, features Big Sean along with Kanye West, Pusha T and southern rapper 2 Chainz. Big Sean then announced his fourth mixtape would be titled \\"Detroit\\" and would serve as a lead-in to his second studio album. He then began promoting the mixtape, releasing short versions of the songs on his YouTube page. On September 5, 2012, Big Sean released the mixtape Detroit which features guest appearances from fellow rappers J. Cole, Juicy J, King Chip, French Montana, Royce da 5'9\\", Kendrick Lamar and Tyga.  Big Sean pushed back the release date of his second studio album Hall of Fame, and was eventually released on August 27, 2013. The album has skits to give it a \\"classic feel\\", and includes features from multiple artists, including Lil Wayne, Miguel, and Nas. The album's production was primarily handled by No I.D., and Key Wane along with additional production from Hit-Boy, and Da Internz, Mike Dean, Travis Scott, Xaphoon Jones and Young Chop among others. Big Sean also stated in an interview that he was in the studio with fellow Detroit native Eminem. Sean went on to say they made a \\"Detroit classic\\" but he is unsure if it will be on Hall of Fame because of \\"timing issues\\". Hall of Fame had spawned five singles, \\"Guap\\", \\"Switch Up\\" featuring Common, \\"Beware\\" featuring Jhene Aiko and Lil Wayne, \\"Fire\\", and \\"Ashley\\" featuring Miguel.  A month prior to the release of Hall of Fame, Big Sean told Complex that he had already begun work on his third album due to the inspiration from his new relationship. On September 12, 2014 Big Sean announced that he had signed with Roc Nation. Later that same day he released four new songs titled, \\"I Don't Fuck with You\\", \\"Paradise\\", \\"4th Quarter\\" and \\"Jit/Juke\\". Producers for these songs include, Mike Will Made It, DJ Mustard, Kanye West, DJ Dahi, Nate Fox, Da Internz, L&F, and Key Wane. \\"I Don't Fuck with You\\" was released to iTunes on September 19, 2014. In an interview with Sway Calloway, Sean confirmed that Lil Wayne will be featured on the album.  On January 25, 2015 various artists who worked on Big Sean's upcoming third studio album such as Kanye West, Ty Dolla Sign, DJ Mustard, Drake, Travis Scott and Ariana Grande posted the album cover to Twitter or Instagram. The next day, Big Sean posted a trailer to his new album which revealed the album's release date as February 24, 2015. The album, Dark Sky Paradise debuted atop the Billboard 200 making it his first No. 1 album. He would lead with Video singles for songs entitled \\"IDFWU\\", \\"Blessings\\", \\"I Know\\", \\"One Man Can Change The World\\", and \\"Play No Games.\\" As of February 1, 2016, Dark Sky Paradise was certified platinum. On December 31, 2015, Big Sean released a track recapping 2015, \\"What A Year (Ft. Pharrell Williams & Detail)\\".  On March 25, 2016, Big Sean released a track to celebrate his 28th birthday, \\"Get My Shit Together\\". Two days later he announced a self-titled album with Jhene Aiko, as TWENTY88, scheduled to be released on April 1, 2016, exclusively on Tidal. On April 5, 2016, the Album became available on Spotify and Apple Music. A week after the exclusive release of TWENT88 on Tidal, Big Sean and Jhene Aiko released a 15-minute short film called \\"Out of Love\\", which is composed of several recordings from the album. Around the same month, upon the wake of the Flint water crisis, Big Sean tweeted to the city's official Twitter account, asking if he could do anything to help, and later on donated $10,000.  On October 31, 2016, Big Sean released \\"Bounce Back\\" as the lead single from his fourth studio album, I Decided, which was released February 3, 2017. \\"Moves\\" was released as an instant-grat on December 16, 2016. Sean has consulted the advice of Jay Z and Rick Rubin while working on the album. Big Sean achieved his second number one album on the Billboard 200 chart, as I Decided debuted at the top. It earned 151,000 equivalent album units in the week of February 9, according to Nielsen Music. 65,000 of the amount were in pure album sales. As of April 18, 2017, I Decided was certified gold.  Two months after the release of I Decided, Big Sean was offered the official Key to the City of Detroit for his contribution to his own Sean Anderson foundation.  On November 3, 2017, Sean released the single \\"Pull Up N Wreck\\" featuring 21 Savage in collaboration with producer Metro Boomin. A month later, it was announced that Sean and Metro Boomin were to release a collaborative album titled Double or Nothing (2017).

Ferdinand II's suspicion of Wallenstein resumed in 1633, when Wallenstein attempted to arbitrate the differences between the Catholic and Protestant sides. Ferdinand II may have feared that Wallenstein would switch sides, and arranged for his arrest after removing him from command. One of Wallenstein's soldiers, Captain Devereux, killed him when he attempted to contact the Swedes in the town hall of Eger  on 25 February 1634.

Bourdieu's work was primarily concerned with the dynamics of power in society, and especially the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and social order maintained within and across generations. In conscious opposition to the idealist tradition of much of Western philosophy, his work often emphasized the corporeal nature of social life and stressed the role of practice and embodiment in social dynamics.\\n\\nBourdieu \\"was, for many, the leading intellectual of present-day France... a thinker in the same rank as Foucault, Barthes and Lacan\\". His works have been translated into two dozen languages and have affected the whole gamut of disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities. They have also been used in pedagogy. Several works of his are considered classics, not only in sociology, but also in anthropology, education, and cultural studies. Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste (La Distinction) was named as one of the 20th century's ten most important works of sociology by the International Sociological Association. The Rules of Art has significantly affected sociology, history, literature and aesthetics.  In France, Bourdieu was seen not as an ivory tower academic or \\"cloistered don\\" but as a passionate activist for those he believed to be subordinated by society. In 2001, a documentary film about Bourdieu - Sociology is a Martial Art - \\"became an unexpected hit in Paris. Its very title stressed how much of a politically engaged intellectual Bourdieu was, taking on the mantle of Emile Zola and Jean-Paul Sartre in French public life and slugging it out with politicians because he thought that was what people like him should do.\\"  For Bourdieu, sociology was a combative effort, exposing the un-thought structures beneath the physical (somatic) and thought practices of social agents. He saw sociology as a means of confronting symbolic violence and exposing those unseen areas where one could be free.  Bourdieu's work continues to be influential. His work is widely cited, and many sociologists and other social scientists work explicitly in a Bourdieusian framework. One example is Loic Wacquant, who persistently applies the Bourdieusian theoretical and methodological principles to subjects such as boxing, employing what Bourdieu termed participant objectivation (objectivation participante), or what Wacquant calls \\"carnal sociology.\\" In addition to publishing a book on Bourdieu's lasting influence, novelist Edouard Louis uses the legacy of Pierre Bourdieu as a literary device.  Bourdieu also played a crucial role in the popularisation of correspondence analysis and particularly multiple correspondence analysis. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. \\"I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because I think that it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as I try to do it with the concept of field,\\" Bourdieu said, in the preface to The Craft of Sociology.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"Did he write a book?","rationale":"The article mentions that Bourdieu's works are considered classics and have been translated into two dozen languages.

He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents, John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (nee Coonan). Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger in the 1960s. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line.\\n\\nWest Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.  Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.  In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence.  In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test.\\n\\nWho did the big things","target":"Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside","rationale":"The Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside."},{"source":"I read this background article the other day: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution.

The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).","target":"Danube","rationale":"The Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year, whereas the Volga river delta has been shrinking due to increased human occupation and agriculture. If the tidal currents are stronger at a location, it means that sediment is being washed out into the water body faster than it can be deposited by the river. This would make deltas smaller over time as they shrink from erosion of their material.\\nSince both rivers have large deltas, we can conclude that neither of them flows into seas with very fast tides or else those areas would not see much deposition in comparison to other locations along these two rivers' courses"},{"source":"In this task, you will be given a list of numbers.

However, action 1 involves the speaker being upset because their friends were making suicide jokes, which may be insensitive or difficult to hear for the speaker. Action 2 involves the speaker being upset because someone compared their car wrecks even though there is a difference between them. The first action expresses concern and empathy towards others, while the second action is more self-centered as it is only concerned with how much better one's car wreck was than another person's car wreck. Therefore, action 1 is less ethical than action 2 and 'no' should be answered."},{"source":"You are given a dialog between 2 or more individuals.

Twelve days after Chinese troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China. After decimating the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and U.S. military occurred on 1 November 1950; deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the U.S. 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan.

S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time. During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion. He was treated at St. Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged. Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit. Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating. Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment. It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush.  On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs signal, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011.  Despite several failed attempts to restart Rana upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his Enthiran character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film Ra.One (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. In November 2011, it was decided that Rana would be shelved in favour of a new project with Rajinikanth, titled Kochadaiiyaan. The motion capture film, which is the first of its kind in India, was released in 2014 to positive reviews. Kochadaiiyaan, and the 3D release of Sivaji in 2012, made Rajinikanth the first Indian actor to have appeared in four different forms of world cinema: black-and-white, colour, 3D and motion capture. Following the completion of Kochadaiiyaan, Rajinikanth began work in Ravikumar's next directorial venture, titled Lingaa alongside Anushka Shetty and Sonakshi Sinha. The film was released on 12 December 2014, coinciding with his birthday, and received mixed reviews from critics. Rajinikanth's next film was director Pa. Ranjith's crime drama Kabali, produced by S. Thanu. The film was released in July 2016. Rajinikanth is filming for 2.0, a spiritual successor to Enthiran, that is scheduled for release in 2017. In August 2016, it was announced that he would work with Ranjith again for a new film produced by Dhanush.  Rajinikanth has often been referred to as the most popular film actor in South India by the media and audiences. In 2015, a film about his fandom, For the Love of a Man, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival.  His popularity has been attributed to \\"his uniquely styled dialogues and idiosyncrasies in films, as well as his political statements and philanthropy\\". Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth's popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life. Almost every film of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in an inimitable style, and these punchlines often have a message or even warn the film's antagonists. These dialogues are usually fabricated to create new ones or even be taken in a comical way, but do not fail to create a sense of entertainment among viewers. It is suggested by the media that actresses such as Gouthami and Nayanthara got their initial breakthrough after co-starring with Rajinikanth very early in their careers, giving other aspiring actors the urge to work with him.  Rajinikanth is also the only Indian actor to be featured in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, in a lesson titled From Bus Conductor to Superstar. After opening his first official Twitter account in 2014, Rajinikanth received over 210,000 followers within 24 hours, which according to The Economic Times was deemed by social media research firms as the fastest rate of followers for any Indian celebrity, as well as among the top-10 in the world.  Much like Chuck Norris facts, \\"Rajinikanth facts\\" or \\"Rajinikanth jokes\\" are widely circulated in text messages and memes over the Internet. These satirical jokes have also inspired several mobile applications for iOS and Android.  Critics, such as Cho Ramaswamy, have commented that Rajinikanth has the potential to be successful in Indian politics due to his popularity and fan base alone. In 1995, Rajinikanth began supporting the Indian National Congress after meeting Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. An opinion poll conducted by the magazine Kumudam predicted that Congress, with Rajinikanth's support, might win up to 130 seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. In 1996, when the Congress Party decided to align with All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) for the assembly election in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth changed loyalties and supported the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) alliance. The TMC used a bicycle as their election symbol and used an image of Rajinikanth riding a bicycle from the film Annamalai in their posters. Rajinikanth said: \\"Even God cannot save Tamil Nadu if AIADMK returns to power.\\" Rajinikanth wholeheartedly supported the DMK and TMC alliance and asked the people of Tamil Nadu and his fans to vote for that alliance. This alliance had a complete victory in 1996. Rajinikanth also supported the DMK-TMC alliance in the parliamentary election, held the same year. Later in 2004, Rajinikanth said he would personally vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but would not extend his support to any front during the upcoming Indian general election. The party, however, failed to win any seats in Tamil Nadu in the Lok Sabha.  Fans of Rajinikanth in Tamil Nadu have continuously speculated on his entry in politics, particularly to run for Chief Minister of the state. In 2008, a few fans in Coimbatore launched a political party for Rajinikanth, in an attempt to pressure his entry. The party was named the Desiya Dravadar Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, with a dedicated party flag and symbol. After learning about this, Rajinikanth submitted an open letter to the media, declaring that he had no connection with these events and requested fans not to indulge in such activities, warning that he would take legal action if they failed to adhere. He also mentioned that he was not interested in politics, and thus was only committed to working in films. He added that nobody can force him to enter politics, just as no one can stop him from entering it.  Rajinikanth announced entry into politics on 31 Dec 2017 and confirmed that his newly formed party will contest in assembly elections in 2021 from all 234 constituencies in Tamil Nadu state. His party, he said, would resign if it was unable to fullfill its electoral promises within three years of coming into power.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"What are his political views?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"Rajinikanth began supporting the Indian National Congress","rationale":"The beginning of the text talks about Rajinikanth's political views.

I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work!\\nIt was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation.

He attended Brookline High School (a 1991 graduate), and played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox. Epstein attended Yale University where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the Yale Daily News.\\n\\nAfter leaving the position as the Padres' President, Lucchino became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Red Sox on November 15, 2001 and hired Epstein to work under him. At the end of the 2002 season, Lucchino appointed Epstein to replace interim general manager (GM) Mike Port. Epstein is credited with initiating the trade of Nomar Garciaparra and making key contract acquisitions including those of Kevin Millar and Curt Schilling during his first tenure as Red Sox GM. The new players were regarded as instrumental in breaking the so-called \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" when the Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. It was the Red Sox' first World Series championship since 1918, ending what remains the third longest championship drought in the history of any Major League team, after the Chicago White Sox (1917-2005) and the Chicago Cubs (1908-2016).  On October 31, 2005, Epstein resigned, rejecting a three-year, $1.5-million-per-year contract for personal reasons. According to The Boston Globe, \\"This is a job you have to give your whole heart and soul to\\", he said. \\"In the end, after a long period of reflection about myself and the program, I decided I could no longer put my whole heart and soul into it.\\" Because it was Halloween the night he resigned from the Red Sox, Epstein left Fenway Park wearing a gorilla suit in an attempt to avoid reporters. A witness reported spotting a person wearing a gorilla suit driving a Volvo similar to Epstein's that night. The suit was loaned to him and was later auctioned for $11,000. The money raised was given to The Jimmy Fund and the Foundation to be Named Later (FTBNL).  Epstein remained in contact with the team's front office and on January 12, 2006, he and Red Sox management announced his return. Six days later, the team announced that he would resume the title of general manager and add the title of executive vice president. In November 2007, Epstein announced, at the annual general manager meeting, that he had signed a new contract with the Red Sox but declined to disclose the terms of the deal.  In December 2007, Epstein was mentioned in the Mitchell Report regarding a November 2006 email exchange he had had with Red Sox scout Marc DelPiano on the possible acquisition of closer Eric Gagne. In the email, Epstein asked DelPiano, \\"Have you done any digging on Gagne? I know the Dodgers think he was a steroid guy. Maybe so. What do you hear on his medical?\\" DelPiano replied that \\"steroids IS the issue\\" with Gagne, questioned his \\"poise and commitment\\" and expressed questions about his durability \\"without steroid help.\\" Despite DelPiano's reservations about Gagne, Epstein traded Kason Gabbard and minor league outfielders David Murphy and Engel Beltre to the Texas Rangers for Gagne on July 31, 2007.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Theo Epstein","rationale":"The context is a description of the life and career of Theo Epstein.

The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. \\"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business. Everything will be taken over by the new company,\\" said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities. Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said.

Analysis of about 1500 in vitro translation products on giant two-dimensional gels revealed rapid hormonal influences on only 7 mRNAs, 6 whose translation products have mol wt and pIs identical to those proteins whose synthesis has been found to be increased after the addition of glucocorticoids to thymus cells. The additional mRNA codes for glucocortin, whose induction in thymus as well as other target cells has been reported. mRNA inductions for proteins 1, 2, and 1N are detectable 15-30 min after the addition of dexamethasone to isolated thymus cells and continue to increase until 2 h, whereas the mRNAs for proteins 4 and 5 are not increased until after 1 h. The mRNA for protein 3 is elevated by 1 h, but attempts to quantitate the change at earlier times have failed because this protein focuses poorly. The parallel between these in vitro translation results and the increased synthesis of individual proteins seen in whole cells demonstrates that increased mRNA levels underlie the cellular changes.

Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.With the death of Zhengde and ascension of Jiajing, the politics at court shifted in favor of the Neo-Confucian establishment which not only rejected the Portuguese embassy of Fernão Pires de Andrade (d. 1523), but had a predisposed animosity towards Tibetan Buddhism and lamas. Evelyn S. Rawski, a professor in the Department of History of the University of Pittsburgh, writes that the Ming's unique relationship with Tibetan prelates essentially ended with Jiajing's reign while Ming influence in the Amdo region was supplanted by the Mongols.The Chinese Ming dynasty also deliberately helped to propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. The Ming assisted Altan Khan, King of the Tümed Mongols, when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism.Meanwhile, the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region (modern Qinghai), raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan (1507–1582). Klieger writes that Altan Khan's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet.

As the average workweek lengthens, leisure time drops. Yet some of the world's busiest people are able to develop rewarding careers and also make time for family and leisure activities. Here is their best advice plus that of time-management experts:\\n1. Use your peak hours wisely.\\nPeople tend to be most alert in late morning and midevening. Afternoon brings an increase in sleepiness. Use your high-efficiency hours to handle difficult jobs or engage in creative thinking. For low-efficiency times, concentrate on cleaning up or sorting your mail. By adapting to your mental condition, you can accomplish more in less time.\\n2. Make a plan.\\nJust 20 minutes of organizing can save an hour of extra effort remembering what must be done. \\"Don't try to carry your life around in your head,\\" says Lucy Hedrick, author of Five Days to an Organized Life. \\"Write things down so you can free your brain for more inventive pursuit  .\\"\\n3. Discourage drop-ins.\\nThe person who welcomes every visitor will get plenty of conversation but won't accomplish much.\\nThe trick is to develop harmless ways to protect yourself from minute-stealing interruptions. David E. Levy, a public-relations consultant  , uses an alternative to the open-door policy by keeping his door half open. The message is clear: he really doesn't want you to come in, but you can if it is important.\\n4. Tame   the telephone.\\nFew devices save more minutes--or waste so many more--than the telephone. Signal the end of your conversation with a phrase such as \\"Before we hang up...\\" You can save even more time by not taking every incoming call.\\nKeep a record of when people you call regularly are least busy and call them at those times. Even better, make appointments to call important contacts.\\nTo help us gain an extra hour every day, a clockmaker in Dallas has created a timer measuring each minute at 57.6 seconds. The 2.5 seconds borrowed from each minute add up to an extra 60 minutes at the end of each day.\\nQuestion: Why does David E.

It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm!\\nThe crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it.

The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin.

The Ottoman delegation was led by Foreign Minister Mehmed Talat Bey, assisted by Naval Minister Çürüksulu Mahmud Pasha and Halil Bey. Although Russia tried to intervene throughout August to prevent Edirne from becoming Turkish again, Toshev told the Ottomans at Constantinople that \\"he Russians consider Constantinople their natural inheritance. Their main concern is that when Constantinople falls into their hands it shall have the largest possible hinterland. If Adrianople is in the possession of the Turks, they shall get it too.\\" Resigned to losing Edirne, the Bulgarians played for Kırk Kilise . Both sides made competing declarations: Savov that \\"Bulgaria, who defeated the Turks on all fronts, cannot end this glorious campaign with the signing of an agreement which retains none of the battlefields on which so much Bulgarian blood has been shed,\\" and Mahmud Pasha that \\"hat we have taken is ours.\\" In the end, none of the battlefields were retained in the Treaty of Constantinople of 30 September.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.\\nThe young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

On 31 December 1435 the Teutonic Knights signed a peace treaty at Brześć Kujawski. They agreed to cease their support for Švitrigaila, and in the future to support only Grand Dukes who had been properly elected jointly by Poland and Lithuania. The treaty did not change the borders that had been set by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Teutonic and Livonian Orders no longer interfered in Polish-Lithuanian affairs; instead, Poland and Lithuania would involve themselves in the Thirteen Years' War , the civil war that would tear Prussia in half.\\n\\nQuestion: Which event happened first, the Battle of Pabaiskas or the signing of the peace treaty?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Battle of Pabaiskas","rationale":"To answer the question, we have to compare the year when Battle of Pabaiskas happened and signing of peace treaty took place.

H. Irving, was an English stage actor in the Victorian era, known as an actor-manager because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the Lyceum Theatre, establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre. In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a knighthood, indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. Irving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for Count Dracula, the title character of the 1897 novel Dracula whose author, Bram Stoker, was business manager of the theatre.\\n\\nIn 1878, Irving entered into a partnership with actress Ellen Terry and re-opened the Lyceum under his own management. With Terry as Ophelia and Portia, he revived Hamlet and produced The Merchant of Venice (1879). His Shylock was as much discussed as his Hamlet had been, the dignity with which he invested the vengeful Jewish merchant marking a departure from the traditional interpretation of the role.  After the production of Tennyson's The Cup and revivals of Othello (in which Irving played Iago to Edwin Booth's title character) and Romeo and Juliet, there began a period at the Lyceum which had a potent effect on the English stage.  Much Ado about Nothing (1882) was followed by Twelfth Night (1884); an adaptation of Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield by W. G. Wills (1885); Faust (1886); Macbeth (1888, with incidental music by Arthur Sullivan); The Dead Heart, by Watts Phillips (1889); Ravenswood by Herman, and Merivales' dramatic version of Scott's Bride of Lammermoor (1890). Portrayals in 1892 of the characters of Wolsey in Henry VIII and of the title character in King Lear were followed in 1893 by a performance of Becket in Tennyson's play of the same name. During these years, too, Irving, with the whole Lyceum company, paid several successful visits to the United States and Canada, which were repeated in succeeding years. As Terry aged, there seemed to be fewer opportunities for her in his company; that was one reason she eventually left, moving on into less steady but nonetheless beloved stage work, including solo performances of Shakespeare's women.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Henry Irving","rationale":"The context explains that the text is about a British actor named Henry Irving. \\nTherefore, the answer to the question \\"Which entity is this text about?\\" would be: \\n\\"Henry Irving\\"."},{"source":"Dimitri Zinovievich Tiomkin (May 10, 1894 - November 11, 1979) was a Russian-born American film composer and conductor. Classically trained in St. Petersburg, Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution, he moved to Berlin and then New York City after the Russian Revolution. In 1929, after the stock market crash, he moved to Hollywood, where he became best known for his scores for Western films, including Duel in the Sun, Red River, High Noon, The Big Sky, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Last Train from Gun Hill. Tiomkin received twenty-two Academy Award nominations and won four Oscars, three for Best Original Score for High Noon, The High and the Mighty, and The Old Man and the Sea, and one for Best Original Song for \\"The Ballad of High Noon\\" from the former film.\\n\\nFollowing his work for Fred Zinnemann on The Men (1950), Tiomkin composed the score for the same director's High Noon (1952). His theme song was \\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'\\" (\\"The Ballad of High Noon\\"). At its opening preview to the press, the film, which starred Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, did badly. Tiomkin writes that \\"film experts agreed that the picture was a flat failure... The producers hesitated to release the picture.\\" Tiomkin bought the rights to the song and released it as a single for the popular music market, with singer Frankie Laine. The record became an immediate success worldwide. Based on the song's popularity, the studio released the film four months later, with the words sung by country western star Tex Ritter. The film received seven Academy Award nominations and won four awards, including two for Tiomkin: Best Original Music and Best Song. Walt Disney presented him with both awards that evening.  According to film historian Arthur R. Jarvis, Jr., the score \\"has been credited with saving the movie.\\" Another music expert, Mervyn Cooke, agrees, adding that \\"the song's spectacular success was partly responsible for changing the course of film-music history\\". Tiomkin was the second composer to receive two Oscars (score and song) for the same dramatic film. (The first was Leigh Harline, who won Best Original Score for Disney's Pinocchio and Best Song for \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". Ned Washington wrote its lyrics as he did for \\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin\\".)  The song's lyrics briefly tell High Noon's entire story arc, a tale of cowardice and conformity in a small Western town. Tiomkin composed his entire score around this single western-style ballad. He also eliminated violins from the ensemble. He added a subtle harmonica in the background, to give the film a \\"rustic, deglamorized sound that suits the anti-heroic sentiments\\" expressed by the story.  According to Russian film historian Harlow Robinson, building the score around a single folk tune was typical of many Russian classical composers. Robinson adds that the source of Tiomkin's score, if indeed folk, has not been proven. However, the Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture, on page 124, states: \\"The fifty-year period in the USA between 1914, the start of the First World War and the year of Irving Berlin's first full score, Watch Your Step, and 1964, the premiere of Boek and Hamick's Fiddler on the Roof, is informed by a rich musical legacy from Yiddish folk tunes (for example Mark Warshavsky's \\"Di milners trem,\\" The miller's tears: and Dimitri Tiomkin's \\"Do Not Forsake Me.\\" High Noon)...\\" The composer worked again for Zinnemann on The Sundowners (1960).  Tiomkin won two more Oscars in subsequent years: for The High and the Mighty (1954), directed by William A. Wellman, and featuring John Wayne; and The Old Man and the Sea (1958), adapted from an Ernest Hemingway novel. During the 1955 ceremonies, Tiomkin thanked all of the earlier composers who had influenced him, including Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other names from the European classical tradition.\\n\\ndid he work with that director again?","target":"The composer worked again for Zinnemann on The Sundowners (1960).","rationale":"From the given context, the answer obviously seems to be: The composer worked again for Zinnemann on The Sundowners (1960)."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province.\\n\\n- Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta.

The depolarization was associated with decreased input resistance. Ca ionophore A23187 caused similar mesangial cell contraction and depolarization. The reversal potential (Vr) of the depolarization response to AII and AVP was -29 +/- 3 and -25 +/- 7 mV (mean +/- SD), respectively. Not only the Vr of the AII-induced depolarization but also Vr of the Ca ionophore-induced response was dependent upon the extracellular Cl- concentration. Further, AII and AVP caused cell contraction and membrane depolarization in Ca++-free medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA.

The Moops have recently begun to develop an effective method of communication that they use to pass important information to one another. The Flavins, however, are more primitive and currently have no method of communication.\\n\\nHint: Communication is any way that animals share information. Many animals live in social groups. For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict.

Here we show that DAP kinase (DAPk), a cell death promoting Ser/Thr protein kinase, plays a main role in oxidative stress-induced JNK signaling. We identify protein kinase D (PKD) as a novel substrate of DAPk and demonstrate that DAPk physically interacts with PKD in response to oxidative stress. We further show that DAPk activates PKD in cells and that induction of JNK phosphorylation by ectopically expressed DAPk can be attenuated by knocking down PKD expression or by inhibiting its catalytic activity. Moreover, knockdown of DAPk expression caused a marked reduction in JNK activation under oxidative stress, indicating that DAPk is indispensable for the activation of JNK signaling under these conditions. Finally, DAPk is shown to be required for cell death under oxidative stress in a process that displays the characteristics of caspase-independent necrotic cell death. Taken together, these findings establish a major role for DAPk and its specific interaction with PKD in regulating the JNK signaling network under oxidative stress.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not include a topic sentence, relevant supporting sentences and a closing/transition sentence.

Brad had very high levels of cholesterol, while Henry was healthier and had normal levels of cholesterol.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-Platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).\\n\\nFollowing the success of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst its saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus' studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing its new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks. Meteora features a mixture of the band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003 and instantly earned worldwide recognition, going to No. 1 in the US and UK, and No. 2 in Australia.  Meteora sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the Billboard charts at the time. The album's singles, including \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", \\"Breaking the Habit\\", \\"Faint\\", and \\"Numb\\", received significant radio attention. By October 2003, Meteora sold nearly three million copies. The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit. Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones. The band released an album and DVD, titled Live in Texas, which featured some audio and video tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour. In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world tour titled the Meteora World Tour. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., Story of the Year and Pia.  Meteora earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV awards for Best Rock Video for \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" and the Viewer's Choice Award for \\"Breaking the Habit\\". Linkin Park also received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year (\\"Numb\\") awards. Although Meteora was not nearly as successful as Hybrid Theory, it was the third best selling album in the United States during 2003. The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts.

There were 114 males and 30 females with a mean age of 28.6 years. The total time of followup was 8,810 patient months with a mean followup of 61 months (range, 12-144 months). Indications for splenectomy were blunt trauma, 111 patients; penetrating trauma, six patients; and intra-operative injury, 27 patients. During the followup to date, 15 late major septic complications requiring hospitalization have occurred in 13 patients (9%). Fulminant pneumococcal sepsis resulted in the death of a 27-year-old male, 3 years after splenectomy. Septicemia occurred in four patients, pneumonia in five, abscess in two, infection of a prosthetic heart valve in one, meningitis in one, and fever of unknown origin in one. All but two of these infections were due to encapsulated organisms. Minor septic complications occurred in 44 patients (30%), and consisted of infections which required outpatient medical care. Major late septic complications occurred more frequently following incidental splenectomy than following splenectomy for blunt or penetrating trauma (18.5% and 5.9% respectively; p less than 0.05). The mortality from major septic complications in this series (7%) is lower than previously reported by other investigators (30-80%). Our data suggest that adults undergoing splenectomy for trauma are at an increased risk of developing late major septic complications. This risk is significant enough to warrant attempts at splenic salvage, especially when injury is incidental to an elective operative procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","target":"Late septic complications in adults following splenectomy for trauma: a prospective analysis in 144 patients","rationale":"The main focus of this paper is the prevalence of late septic complications in adults following splenectomy for trauma.

They made it clear that they had no intentions of carrying on as a trio, and called upon band leader Dana Cappillino's wife Leigh to join her husband on tour.

Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way.\\nThe Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours.

Nowadays, they also live in Atlantic waters off the East Coast of the United States.

They provided the first solid evidence that lionfish were in the Atlantic. \\nA year later, scientists documented 19 lionfish sightings at eight locations along the North Carolina continental shelf. Then, lionfish were observed off the coasts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and even as far north as Long Island, New York! Between 2000 and 2003, lionfish sightings were reported at 16 different shipwrecks and natural hard bottom locations. During a summer 2004 research expedition, NOAA(The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) scientists collected 155 lionfish at 19 different locations off the North Carolina coast alone. The jump in numbers and distributions over such a short time strongly indicates that the lionfish is reproducing in the Atlantic Ocean. If this is true, it's the first time that a western Pacific fish has populated the U.S. Atlantic coast.\\nThese lionfish were likely released on purpose when people no longer wanted them! The swift and warm Gulf Stream, which transported the floating lionfish eggs from Florida northward, helped the lionfish's Atlantic journey. In Florida waters and along the continental shelf near the Gulf Stream the temperatures are very similar to the lionfish's native waters. \\nHowever, from north Florida upward, the waters along the coastline are too cold in the winter for lionfish to survive.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.\\n\\nand the situation: Brad and Henry were two old friends in their 70's.

The bay also provides habitat for juvenile sea animals that have left the shelter of the mangrove belts.  Manatees frequent the quiet waters of the bay. The bay has a year-round population of double-crested cormorants. Winter residents include northern gannets, American white pelicans and common loons. The bay also has a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins.Biscayne Bay is a shallow lagoon with little vertical density or salinity gradient due to its lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals on the west side and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum. Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. The endangered Johnson's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is at the southern end of the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years.

Ricketts (January 15, 1853  January 19, 1939), often credited as Tom Ricketts, was an English stage and film actor and director who was a pioneer in the film industry. He portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in the first American film adaptation of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (1908), and directed one of the first motion pictures ever made in Hollywood. After directing scores of silent films, including the first film to be released by Universal Pictures, Ricketts became a prominent character actor.\\n\\n- A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.\\n\\n- An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- A character actor or character actress is a supporting actor who plays unusual, interesting, or eccentric characters. The term, often contrasted with that of leading actor, is somewhat abstract and open to interpretation. In a literal sense, all actors can be considered character actors since they all play \\"characters\\", but in the usual sense it is an actor who plays a distinctive and important supporting role. \\n\\n- Ebenezer Scrooge is the focal character of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, \\"A Christmas Carol\\".\\nAt the beginning of the novella, Scrooge is a cold-hearted miser who despises Christmas.

This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace.

They compared the vision  and habits of 100 seven-year-old children in Singapore and Australia. In all, 30% of the Singaporean children were short-sighted--this rate  was ten times higher than Australian children.\\nBoth groups spend a similar amount  of time reading, watching television and playing computer games. However the Singaporean children spent an average   of only half an hour a day outdoors--90 minutes less than the Australian children.\\nProfessor Ian Morgan, from the Australian Research Council's vision Centre, said, \\"Humans are naturally long-sighted, but when people begin to go to school and spend little or no time outdoors, the number of short-sighted people gets larger. We're also seeing more and more short-sighted children in cities all around the world and the main reason may be that city children spend less time outdoors.\\nDaylight can be hundreds of times brighter than indoor light.

Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s.

Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.","target":"drowning","rationale":"The article mentions that criminals were punished with executions, which could be by decapitation, drowning or impaling on a stake.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones.\\nI had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended).

Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Two politicians are proposing ideas they have about how to better serve the planet.

He has a real and power gift to delight with his conversation, particularly when intoxicated, but other than conversation he produces nothing. Saltram also recognises no obligations or duties, is ungrateful and utterly unreliable, and is apparently prone to immoral acts. He lives off others, particularly the Mulvilles, who, convinced of Saltram's genius and genuinely enjoying his talk, host him for months at a time. In the opinion of the unnamed narrator, Saltram is not a deliberate conman; he simply suffers from \\"a want of dignity\\".\\nThe story revolves around Saltram and a group of people who are fascinated by him. Ruth Anvoy, a young American woman with a wealthy father, comes to Britain to visit her widowed aunt Lady Coxon. There she meets George Gravener, a man with a real intellect and a future in politics, and the two become engaged. She also meets Saltram, and is fascinated and impressed by his talk and intellect, though aware that he has shortcomings of character.\\nHaving made a promise to her now-deceased husband, Lady Coxon has for years been seeking to bestow a sum of 13,000 pounds upon a talented intellectual whose potential has been hampered by lack of money. Having failed to find such a person, Lady Coxon tells Anvoy that upon her death the money will be left to her, and she must carry on the quest.\\nAnvoy's father suffers heavy financial losses and loses most of what he has. He dies, and shortly afterwards Lady Coxon dies. Anvoy, having lost nearly all her wealth, has only the 13,000 pounds from Lady Coxon, with a moral but not legal obligation to give it away. Gravener urges her to keep the money, as it could be used to buy them a house once they are married. She refuses, and their relationship becomes strained. Later, she entertains the idea of giving the money to Saltram, who Gravener despises as a fraud and \\"not a gentleman.\\" Eventually their engagement is broken off.\\nFinally, the unnamed narrator is given a sealed letter and asked to give it to Anvoy. The letter is understood to contain a denunciation of Saltram's most immoral acts. The narrator must decide whether to blight Saltram's prospects by delivering the letter. He is willing to do so if it will save his friend Gravener's engagement with Anvoy, but Gravener is unable to assure him of this.\\nEventually he does offer the letter to Anvoy, but Anvoy declines to read it. She awards the Coxon Fund to Saltram, who lives off it exactly as he lived off his friends, producing nothing of intellectual value. Thus the only result of the award is the Mulvilles and others lose the pleasure of Saltram's conversation.","target":"At what was Frank Saltram most skilled in?","rationale":"The story revolves around Saltram, and the author describes him as \\"a man who apparently has a towering intellect, but one that manifests itself only in sparkling table-talk.\\" Therefore, the most relevant question to ask about Saltram is one that relates to his skill at \\"sparkling table-talk\\", which would be answered by asking: At what was Frank Saltram most skilled in?"},{"source":"Determine the topic of the passage.\\n\\"Windows XP was released worldwide for retail sale on October 25, 2001, and over 400 million copies were in use in January 2006.\\"\\nTopic:","target":"Windows XP","rationale":"The passage is about Windows XP."},{"source":"Here's a problem to solve: Which of the following is an example of matter changing state?\\n\\nAmong the 4 following options, which is the correct answer?\\n\\n- A: heating a pan of water until the water is all gone\\n \\n- B: putting a soft-drink can in the refrigerator to cool it\\n \\n- C: heating soup on the stove until it is hot to your tongue\\n \\n- D: transferring sugar into a storage container","target":"A","rationale":"The correct answer is \\"A\\". \\nHeating a pan of water until the water is all gone refers to evaporization, which causes a change in state from liquid (water) to gas.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French. However, the French lines never broke during their tactical retreat; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight. Late in the afternoon, a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle. A series of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the Austrian army, which fled chaotically over the Bormida River back to Alessandria, leaving behind 14,000 casualties.

They are known for their television programmes on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation channel. The group take their name from their production of satirical newspaper, a publication known to challenge conventions of taste. The group's motto is \\"Striving for Mediocrity in a World of Excellence\\".\\n\\nAfter two years of their satirical newspaper, which also included various radio roles, The Chaser had attracted the attention of Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) star Andrew Denton. Denton signed them with ABC and stated \\"They've got the talent, the work ethic, the fearlessness, the desire\\". Denton then helped the Chaser to perform their first television program The Election Chaser, on ABC TV, which was to be based on the 2001 Australian federal election and in the format of the national tallyroom. Four episodes were broadcast and the show was nominated for the 2002 Logie for \\"Most Outstanding Comedy Program\\". Denton acted as executive producer and script editor for The Election Chaser and would also do so for CNNNN.  The Chaser team have gone on to create other television shows for ABC TV, including the Logie Award winning CNNNN in 2002-3 and The Chaser Decides in 2004. CNNNN was a satire of not only the popular American news networks CNN and Fox News, but also incorporated Australian and world current affairs into the programme. The Election Chaser inspired a similar programme covering the 2004 election, The Chaser Decides. The coverage, as with all the Chaser productions, was satirical, but a different view on the way the election was covered by the local media.  The Chaser Decides returned again in 2007 to cover the 24 November election. It purported to be broadcasting from Australian Electoral Commission's National Tally Room.  In 2004-5, Taylor and Reucassel hosted the Triple J radio drive programme Today Today. In 2005 the rest of the team produced Chaser News Alert (CNA), aired on ABC2. Episodes of this series were only a few minutes long. Between July 2006 and January 2007 Taylor and Reucassel returned to Triple J to host Bloody Sunday, filling the This Sporting Life time slot while Roy & HG were on leave from the station.

Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots.

Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow.

Earlier in the poem, Keats says that he hopes this 'Love' will be a 'high romance' with a 'fair creature.' He also says that he hopes the 'Fame' he seeks will be the result of the 'high piled books' produced by his 'crowded brain.' In other words, Keats's fear is that death is a 'nothingness' that will arrive before he can finish his life's work or find his true love.\\nDonne has a different attitude toward death, and so the imagery in his poem is different, too.To Donne, death should 'be not proud,' because it is not 'mighty and dreadful.' Unlike Keats, Donne sees death as weak and merely a 'slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men.' He also says that death is like 'rest and sleep'.Donne believes that we will all wake from the sleep of death to everlasting life, just as we wake from our normal sleep to our everyday lives.In fact, Donne believes that it is death itself that will die: 'One short sleep past, we wake forever,/ And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.'\\nKeats and Donne both know that death is a prat of life, and both poets use powerful imagery to talk about that difficult theme.The differences in this imagery show two very different attitudes toward the subject, one of...\\nQuestion: According to the passage,   _   makes Keats's life worth living.\\n- expressing his grand passion for poetry\\n- walking on the shore with a pretty lady\\n- defeating nothingness with his true love\\n- pursuing the fame of being a romantic poet","target":"expressing his grand passion for poetry","rationale":"In the poem, Keats says that he hopes his 'Love' will be a 'high romance', and also states that he may never live to see this love in real life.

By the end of 1940, I Corps in the West (Poland) numbered about 14,000; Polish forces in the Middle East, about 3,000; this does not count the Polish air crews (numbering at least 4,000) and the Polish Navy personnel. After the fall of France, the French forces lagged behind the Polish in numbers. It was only after D-Day and the liberation of the French mainland that French forces swelled to 550,000, outnumbering the Polish Army in the West, but not the combined West, East and partisan forces. Until 1944, Polish forces also outnumbered the French.

The names Achaioi and Danaoi seem to be pre-Dorian belonging to the people who were overthrown. They were forced to the region that later bore the name Achaea after the Dorian invasion. In the 5th century BC, they were redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek which was spoken mainly in Thessaly, Boeotia and Lesbos. There are many controversial theories on the origin of the Achaeans. According to one view, the Achaeans were one of the fair-headed tribes of upper Europe, who pressed down over the Alps during the early Iron age (1300 BC) to southern Europe. Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans. These theories are rejected by other scholars who, based on linguistic criteria, suggest that the Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks. There is also the theory that there was an Achaean ethnos that migrated from Asia minor to lower Thessaly prior to 2000 BC. Some Hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya.

After brushing off a tax agent, Burt Gummer and his son Travis Welker are asked by Dr. Rita Sims and young Graboid hunter Valerie McKee to investigate. Their plane is attacked by an Ass-Blaster, but Burt and Travis make it to the facility. They learn that Arctic heat conditions have made the area prime for Graboids. Burt suspects their research neighbors at DARPA are developing bio-weapons out of the Graboids. When an Ass-Blaster attacks the facility, Burt rescues a researcher but experiences an episode and collapses. He learns that he has been infected by a parasite based on Graboid venom, and that they need to extract the antibodies from a live Graboid.\\nAs Graboids continue to kill off researchers and staff, several members of the group try to make their way from the lab to the generator area where the pilot Mac is repairing the plane, and the facilities manager Swackhamer has created a makeshift underground electric fence. Others head for the communications tower and to turn off a drill that has automatically activated. With his own research team attacked, Agent Cutts of DARPA joins Burt's group, revealing that his team was more interested in extracting the melted water and not fashioning bio-weapons.

The group eventually use a storage container to trap one of the Graboids, spearing it from the side to hold it in place, and cutting off its front tentacles. Travis reaches in the graboid's mouth with a syringe and draws venom from its internal gland sac, which is then used to save Burt.

Keith responded by pointing out that Maines did not write her music and he does, and by displaying a backdrop at his concerts showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On May 21, 2003, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters \\"FUTK\\" on the front at the Academy of Country Music Awards. While a spokesperson for the Dixie Chicks said that the acronym stood for \\"Friends United in Truth and Kindness,\\" many, including host Vince Gill, took it to be a shot at Keith (\\"Fuck You Toby Keith\\"). In an October 2004 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher, Maines finally confessed that it was indeed a shot at Keith, and that she \\"thought that nobody would get it\\".  In August 2003, Keith's representation publicly declared he was done feuding with Maines \\"because he's realized there are far more important things to concentrate on\\". Keith was referring specifically to the terminal illness of a former bandmate's daughter, Allison Faith Webb.

This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly.

Passage:The episode was written by Nell Scovell and directed by Wes Archer. In the episode, Bart and Lisa sneak into the sushi bar's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft, \\"Theme from Shaft\\". The Fox network censors originally did not want the staff to use the song because they thought the lyrics were too obscene for television. In order to prove the censors wrong and show that it could appear on television, the staff dug up footage from an old Academy Awards ceremony at which the song was performed by Isaac Hayes. When the chef at the sushi bar finds out Homer has been poisoned, he yells at his apprentices in Japanese. The staff wanted the language they spoke to be actual Japanese, so they hired a Japanese actor who translated the lines for them. The episode introduced the character Akira, who has appeared many times later on the show. American actor George Takei provided the voice of Akira, although the character was voiced in later episodes by Hank Azaria. The episode featured many other guest appearances; Larry King as himself; Sab Shimono as the sushi bar chef; Joey Miyashima as Toshiro, the apprentice chef who slices up the fugu; and Diane Tanaka as hostess of the bar. King's role was first offered to American singer Bruce Springsteen, but he turned it down. According to showrunner Sam Simon, actor William Shatner also rejected the part.\\n Links: a.

He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.\\n\\nHint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...","target":"more","rationale":"Here's the rationale for this question: \\"Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails.

One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the near-death of his Uncle Max by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets Rafiki, who teaches him about \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and advises him to \\"look beyond what you see\\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon.\\nThe pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas, causing nearby animals to faint but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", Mufasa's fight with the Hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas. Eventually, the pair are caught in the wildebeest stampede that killed Mufasa in the original film, and are thrown off a waterfall. Exhausted, Timon decides to give up, until Pumbaa discovers a luxurious green jungle.

So it was when a reader, Randall Horton, passed along a recent mailer from state Rep. Dwayne Bohac, R-Houston, which opens: \\"\\"Honesty matters, especially in politics.\\"\\" The Truth-O-Meter kicked in at Bohac's reference to Annie's List, a Texas group dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women. His leaflet calls the group \\"\\"a liberal special-interest group who supports third-trimester abortion on demand.\\"\\" Is that so? Some background: Annie's List was founded in 2003, its website says. According to Robert Jones, its political director, the group was modeled on the nationally established EMILY's List, which describes itself as \\"\\"dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women to office.\\"\\" EMILY is an acronym: Early Money Is Like Yeast. And, as Bohac's mailer says, Annie's List backs Bohac's Democratic challenger, Kendra Yarbrough Camarena. Through Sept. 23, state records show, Camarena had received about $77,000 from Annie's List, accounting for about 26 percent percent of her contributions since March 2009. UPDATE, 10:45 a.m. Oct. 21, 2010: After we published this article, a Bohac campaign consultant, Bryan Eppstein, pointed to information backing up another Bohac claim that Annie's List has contributed more than $100,000 to Camarena's cause. His figure takes into account both the group's direct contributions to Camarena's campaign, which we tallied for our original article, and indirect contributions that to date have been reported only by Annie's List; these include expenditures for pro-Camarena direct mail, campaign staff and software. Also, the reader who forwarded Bohac's mailer gave us permission to include his name in this article. How to regulate late-term abortions has proved to be a simmering national issue. In 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act outlawing a procedure known medically as \\"\\"intact dilation and extraction.\\"\\" The U.S. Supreme Court later upheld the law, which had been challenged by physicians and abortion-rights activists who said the procedure is often the safest to use late in a pregnancy because it \\"\\"minimizes the chances of injury to the uterus,\\"\\" according to an April 2007 recap by The New York Times. When does a pregnancy become \\"\\"late-term\\"\\"? Elizabeth Nash — a public policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health — told us that the term \\"\\"is more of a political or layperson term\\"\\" and that \\"\\"people have all sorts of ideas about its definition.\\"\\" Generally speaking, she said, any point past the 18th week of pregnancy, counting from the last menstrual period, could be considered \\"\\"late term.\\"\\" The third trimester is typically thought to begin at the 28-week mark. Late-term abortions are rare. Nationally, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 1.5 percent of U.S. abortions in 2006 occurred at the 21st week or later. According to the most recent data available from the Texas Department of State Health Services, 13 out of 81,591 Texas abortions (about 0.02 percent) in 2008 occurred in the 25th week or later. When we asked Bohac's campaign officials for evidence that Annie's List supports third-trimester abortion \\"\\"on demand,\\"\\" it referred us to his political consultant, Keats Norfleet. Norfleet told us that Annie's List only supports \\"\\"pro-choice, progressive Democratic women candidates who favor late-term abortions.\\"\\" Norfleet sent us several news articles describing Annie's List as backing Democratic women candidates who are \\"\\"pro-choice,\\"\\" though none explicitly mentions third-trimester or late-term abortions. We wondered if Annie's List had clearly stated its position on third-trimester abortions anywhere. The group's website says it wants to elect more women who are \\"\\"pro-choice\\"\\" and who favor \\"\\"reproductive rights,\\"\\" without mention of third-trimester abortions. In an e-mail, Jones said Annie's List doesn't advocate specific stands on issues. \\"\\"We don't advocate for late-term procedures 'on demand,' \\"\\" Jones said. \\"\\"We simply provide resources to progressive Democratic women candidates to help them get elected. And one of the many tenets of what we consider to be progressive is to be pro-choice.\\"\\" Generally, Jones said, the group backs Democratic women who \\"\\"support things like funding for sexual assault and domestic violence prevention, fully funded public schools, clear air and water, access to quality health care, and a woman’s right to choose.\\"\\" As for a candidate's position on third-trimester abortions, Jones said: \\"\\"If there was a bill in Texas to ban so-called partial-birth or late-term abortions, we wouldn't kick a woman off our list just because she supported it\\"\\" as long as she also supported an exclusion for the health and safety of the woman. Jones told us that the group assumes that a candidate's \\"\\"pro-choice\\"\\" position means that she's aligned with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade and subsequent case law. That ruling established a constitutional right to an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. According to a report issued this month by the Guttmacher Institute, the court held in Roe that \\"\\"a woman’s right to an abortion is not absolute and that states could restrict or ban abortions after fetal viability, provided their policies meet certain requirements,\\"\\" including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to approve further restrictions. Texas has two laws restricting third-trimester abortions — one enacted in 1987 and the other in 2005. According to an Austin American-Statesman report, the 2005 law — attached as an amendment to a proposal maintaining the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, now the Texas Medical Board — made it so that serious risk \\"\\"to a woman's mental and physical health would no longer be a reason for an abortion in the last few months of pregnancy. An abortion could still be performed to prevent her death, but otherwise could not be performed unless she is diagnosed with a significant likelihood of suffering imminent severe, irreversible brain damage or paralysis. In addition, a fetus' abnormalities, other than severe, irreversible brain damage, would no longer be an acceptable factor.\\"\\" Mindful that Annie's List is supportive of pro-choice Democratic women but doesn't spell out a position on third-trimester abortions, we looked at what \\"\\"pro-choice\\"\\" means to others who work on abortion-related issues. Nash called that \\"\\"a toughie,\\"\\" adding that \\"\\"sometimes organizations still support a legislator if they vote for a 'partial-birth' abortion ban but are otherwise supportive of abortion rights and work to increase access to family planning and other reproductive health services.\\"\\" Sara Cleveland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, told us that the group defines \\"\\"pro-choice\\"\\" as \\"\\"the original vision of Roe v. Wade,\\"\\" under which \\"\\"states are permitted to ban abortion in the third trimester as long as there are exceptions to the ban for cases of a woman’s life or health endangerment.\\"\\" But Joe Pojman, executive director of an anti-abortion group, Texas Alliance for Life, said he would define \\"\\"pro-choice\\"\\" based on the positions taken by groups that use the term to describe themselves. He used NARAL Pro-Choice Texas as an example, saying correctly that it opposed the 2005 third-trimester measure as well as parental consent requirements for minors seeking abortions. Pojman said Annie's List backs candidates who support \\"\\"abortions rights without limits,\\"\\" singling out state Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, who voted against the 2005 amendment increasing restrictions on third-trimester abortions as well as the final version of the bill containing the ban. We took a closer look at the vote on that amendment, which passed 118-16. We determined that Reps. Alma Allen of Houston and Yvonne Gonzales Toureilles of Alice, both backed this year by Annie's List, voted for the amendment, while Rep. Veronica Gonzales of McAllen, also supported by the group, voted against the amendment. So how about truth, lies and honesty? It's true that Annie's List backs \\"\\"pro-choice\\"\\" Democratic women. And Bohac's politically potent statement rests on the assumption that \\"\\"pro-choice\\"\\" means \\"\\"supports third-trimester abortion on demand.\\"\\" That's a premise that he fails to back up. Annie's List makes no bones about being comfortable with candidates who oppose further restrictions on late-term abortions. Then again, this year it’s backing two House candidates who voted for more limits. Honestly? Bohac's sweeping, unsupported statement is .\\" Claim: Dwayne Bohac Says the Annie's List political group supports third-trimester abortions on demand.","target":"0","rationale":"Bohac's statement, \\"Annie's List is a liberal special-interest group who supports third-trimester abortion on demand\\", is contradicted by the evidence in this paragraph.

Dutch uses one additional character beyond the standard alphabet, the digraph IJ. It has a relatively high proportion of doubled letters, both vowels and consonants, due to the formation of compound words and also to the spelling devices for distinguishing the many vowel sounds in the Dutch language. An example of five consecutive doubled letters is the word voorraaddoos (food storage container). The diaeresis (Dutch: trema) is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately when involving a pre- or suffix. Whereas a hyphen is used when this problem occurs in compound words. For example; \\"beïnvloed\\" (influenced), but zee-eend (sea duck). Generally, other diacritical marks only occur in loanwords, though the acute accent can also be used for emphasis or to differentiate between two forms. Its most common use is to differentiate between the indefinite article 'een' (a, an) and the numeral 'één' (one).","target":"food","rationale":"The context describes how Dutch is written using the Latin alphabet.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. \\nBased on the previous passage, What bigger language family does Illyrian belong to? \\nIs \\"Germanic\\" a correct answer?","target":"No","rationale":"Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.), Both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian.\\nSo the answer should be \\"No\\".

He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda.

Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost.

A second wave of corruption metrics has been created by Global Integrity, the International Budget Partnership, and many lesser known local groups. These metrics include the Global Integrity Index, first published in 2004. These second wave projects aim to create policy change by identifying resources more effectively and creating checklists toward incremental reform. Global Integrity and the International Budget Partnership each dispense with public surveys and instead uses in-country experts to evaluate \\"the opposite of corruption\\" – which Global Integrity defines as the public policies that prevent, discourage, or expose corruption. These approaches compliment the first wave, awareness-raising tools by giving governments facing public outcry a checklist which measures concrete steps toward improved governance.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"the level of corruption and bribery","rationale":"The study is researching the level of corruption and bribery in regards to its impact on political and economic outcomes."},{"source":"In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign.

He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend. After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present. \\nDid Joey and Max prefer playing at the lake or in the forest? \\nI was going to say \\"In the forest\\".
