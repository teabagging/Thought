B cell associated protein 31 (BAP31) is overexpressed in most MMs and might be a promising target for immunotherapy of this disease. Experimental design: Firstly, we investigated the expression profiles of human BAP31 (hBAP31) and mouse BAP31 (mBAP31) in human and mouse normal tissues, respectively. The expression level of hBAP31 in human MMs and mBAP31 in B16 melanoma cells was also analyzed. Then we constructed novel mBAP31 DNA vaccines and tested there ability to stimulate mBAP31-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity in B16 melanoma-bearing mice. Results: For the first time, we found that protein expression of hBAP31 were dramatically upregulated in human MMs when compared with human normal tissues. Predominant protein expression of mBAP31 was found in mouse B16 melanoma cells but not in mouse important organs. When mice were immunized with mBAP31 DNA vaccines, strong cellular response to mBAP31 was observed in the vaccinated mice. CTLs isolated from immunized mice could effectively kill mBAP31-positive target mouse B16 melanoma tumor cells in vitro and vaccination with mBAP31 DNA vaccines had potent anti-tumor activity in therapeutic model using B16 melanoma cells. Conclusions: These are the first data supporting a vaccine targeting BAP31 that is capable of inducing effective immunity against BAP31-expressing MMs and will be applicable to human MMs and hBAP31 DNA vaccine warrants investigation in human clinical trials. \\n Title: BAP31, a promising target for the immunotherapy of malignant melanomas","target":"True","rationale":"The title provides a key insight from the research that BAP31 is a promising target for immunotherapy of malignant melanomas.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.\\n\\nQuestion: Of the two running backs at St. Thomas Aquinas with Joyner, did either go on to play in the NFL? Passage 1:A native of Miami, Florida, Joyner originally attended Southwest Miami High School, where he played three seasons on the varsity football team at linebacker and defensive back as well as wide receiver and kick returner. As a sophomore, he had more than 100 tackles and also accounted for more than 1,000 yards on offense. In his junior year, he recorded 112 tackles, four sacks and an interception. He then decided to transfer to St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a private school and football powerhouse coached by George Smith. Featuring talented running backs Giovani Bernard and James White, St. Thomas Aquinas went undefeated through the season, extending a win-streak that began in 2007 to 37 wins, until losing 28–20 to Manatee High School in a Class 5A state semifinal at Hawkins Stadium in Bradenton, Florida. For the season, Joyner contributed as a shut-down cornerback, recording only 14 tackles (12 solo) as opponents stayed away from his side of the field. He also starred on special teams, as he averaged 39.6 yards per return and managed to return three kickoffs for scores. On offense, he recorded 1,090 all-purpose yards on just 79 touches, scoring four rushing and four receiving touchdowns. His impact on the defensive side, however, earned him the National Defensive Player of the Year award by USA Today.\\n Passage 2:He received his initial education in the so-called Palace Secondary School, which Ferdinand had created in 1908 solely for his sons. Later, Boris graduated from the Military School in Sofia, then took part in the Balkan Wars. During the First World War, he served as liaison officer of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army on the Macedonian front. In 1916, he was promoted to colonel and attached again as liaison officer to Army Group Mackensen and the Bulgarian Third Army for the operations against Romania. Boris worked hard to smooth the sometimes difficult relations between Field Marshal Mackensen and Lieutenant General Stefan Toshev, the commander of the Third Army. Through his courage and personal example, he earned the respect of the troops and the senior Bulgarian and German commanders, even that of the Generalquartiermeister of the German Army, Erich Ludendorff, who preferred dealing personally with Boris and described him as excellently trained, a thoroughly soldierly person and mature beyond his years. In 1918, Boris was made a major general.\\n Passage 3:Poliovirus is an enterovirus. Infection occurs via the fecal–oral route, meaning that one ingests the virus and viral replication occurs in the alimentary tract. Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as brown fat, reticuloendothelial tissue, and muscle. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads to the development of minor symptoms such as fever, headache, and sore throat. Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates in motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent paralysis. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to respiratory arrest and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis. Paralysis typically persists from days to weeks prior to recovery.","target":"1","rationale":"The question asks about the NFL careers of two running backs who played with Joyner at St. Thomas Aquinas.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business.

In 2016, he was knighted for his musical achievements and his services to tourism and charitable causes in Northern Ireland. Known as \\"Van the Man\\", Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \\"Gloria\\".\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, Morrison developed a close association with two vocal talents at opposite ends of their careers: Georgie Fame (with whom Morrison had already worked occasionally) lent his voice and Hammond organ skills to Morrison's band; and Brian Kennedy's vocals complemented the grizzled voice of Morrison, both in studio and live performances.  The 1990s also saw an upsurge in collaborations by Morrison with other artists, a trend continuing into the new millennium. He recorded with Irish folk band the Chieftains on their 1995 album, The Long Black Veil. Morrison's song, \\"Have I Told You Lately\\" won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals in 1995.  He also produced and was featured on several tracks with blues legend John Lee Hooker on Hooker's 1997 album, Don't Look Back. This album won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album in 1998 and the title track \\"Don't Look Back\\", a duet featuring Morrison and Hooker, also won a Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals in 1998. The project capped a series of Morrison and Hooker collaborations that began in 1971 when they performed a duet on the title track of Hooker's 1972 album Never Get Out of These Blues Alive. On this album, Hooker also recorded a cover of Morrison's \\"T.B. Sheets\\".  Morrison additionally collaborated with Tom Jones on his 1999 album Reload, performing a duet on \\"Sometimes We Cry\\", and he also sang vocals on a track entitled \\"The Last Laugh\\" on Mark Knopfler's 2000 album, Sailing to Philadelphia. In 2004, Morrison was one of the guests on Ray Charles' album, Genius Loves Company, featuring the two artists performing Morrison's \\"Crazy Love\\".

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert.

However, drawbacks of end-to-end learning approaches in comparison to classical variational methods are the requirement of expensive retraining for even slightly different problem statements and the lack of provable error bounds during inference. Recent works tackled the first problem by using networks trained for Gaussian image denoising as generic plug-and-play regularizers in energy minimization algorithms. Even though this obtains state-of-the-art results on many tasks, heavy restrictions on the network architecture have to be made if provable convergence of the underlying fixed point iteration is a requirement. More recent work has proposed to train networks to output descent directions with respect to a given energy function with a provable guarantee of convergence to a minimizer of that energy. However, each problem and energy requires the training of a separate network.\\n In this paper we consider the combination of both approaches by projecting the outputs of a plug-and-play denoising network onto the cone of descent directions to a given energy. This way, a single pre-trained network can be used for a wide variety of reconstruction tasks. Our results show improvements compared to classical energy minimization methods while still having provable convergence guarantees.","target":"We use neural networks trained for image denoising as plug-and-play priors in energy minimization algorithms for image reconstruction problems with provable convergence","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe use neural networks trained for image denoising as plug-and-play priors in energy minimization algorithms for image reconstruction problems with provable convergence."},{"source":"You are given a sentence from a conversation between a human and a virtual assistant.

To understand the elements of the periodic table better he categorized them into three groups, cat A, cat B, and cat C. In cat A he placed all the elements with atomic numbers lower than 83. In cat B he put the elements with atomic numbers from 83 to 94. Finally, in cat C he placed the elements with atomic numbers over 94. He found it easier to see their differences after he categorized them.\\n\\nHint: Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 82 each have at least one stable isotope (except for technetium, element 43 and promethium, element 61, which have no stable isotopes). Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our Solar System. At over 1.9×1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements. The very heaviest elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with half-lives so short that they are not found in nature and must be synthesized.","target":"cat B","rationale":"The question asks which category of elements is unlikely to have stable isotopes. According to the hint, all of the known naturally occurring stable isotopes are found in cat A and C. This implies that there would be no stable isotopes among those with atomic numbers 83 through 94 (cat B) because they undergo radioactive decay. So, Cat B is the answer option we should pick for this question."},{"source":"UN forces retreated to Suwon in the west, Wonju in the center, and the territory north of Samcheok in the east, where the battlefront stabilized and held.

Other Cubists, by contrast, especially František Kupka, and those considered Orphists by Apollinaire (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs and Amorpha chromatique chaude, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled Simultaneous Windows, followed by a series entitled Formes Circulaires, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled Contrasts of Forms, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in Les Peintres cubistes (1913), writing of a new \\"pure\\" painting in which the subject was vacated.

Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to confirm and expand our knowledge by combining and studying at one time a vast set of independent studies creating large datasets with increased statistical power. In this study, we performed two metaanalyses of porcine transcriptomic data: i) scrutinized the global immune response to different challenges, and ii) determined the specific response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection. To gain an in-depth knowledge of the pig response to PRRSV infection, we used an original approach comparing and eliminating the common genes from both meta-analyses in order to identify genes and pathways specifically involved in the PRRSV immune response. The software Pointillist was used to cope with the highly disparate data, circumventing the biases generated by the specific responses linked to single studies. Next, we used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software to survey the canonical pathways, biological functions and transcription factors found to be significantly involved in the pig immune response. We used 779 chips corresponding to 29 datasets for the pig global immune response and 279 chips obtained from 6 datasets for the pig response to PRRSV infection, respectively. Conclusions: This work reveals key genes, canonical pathways and biological functions involved in the pig global immune response to diverse challenges, including PRRSV infection. The powerful statistical approach led us to consolidate previous findings as well as to gain new insights into the pig immune response either to common stimuli or specifically to PRRSV infection. \\n Title: Pig immune response to general stimulus and to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection: a meta-analysis approach","target":"True","rationale":"The title provides a short summary of the main findings and conclusions of the research paper.

Petro Doroshenko Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, aiming to gain control of Ukraine but facing defeats from other factions struggling over control of that region, in a final bid to preserve his power in Ukraine, signed a treaty with Sultan Mehmed IV in 1669 that recognized the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire.:273 In the meantime, Commonwealth forces were trying to put down unrest in Ukraine, but were weakened by decades long wars ). Trying to capitalize on that weakness, Tatars, who commonly raided across the Commonwealth borders in search of loot and plunder, invaded, this time allying themselves with Cossacks under hetman Doroshenko. They were however stopped by Commonwealth forces under hetman John Sobieski, who stopped their first push , defeating them several times, and finally gaining an armistice after the Battle of Podhajce. In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried once again to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, supportive of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but again like in 1666-67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed. Thus an irregular border conflict escalated into a regular war in 1671, as the Ottoman Empire was now prepared to send its regular units onto the battlefield in a bid to try to gain control of that region for itself.:646\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The objective of this study was to determine the factors that hinder midwives and parturient women from using hospitals when complications occur during home birth in Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran, where 23% of all deliveries take place in non- hospital settings.   \\n METHODS In the study and data management, a mixed-methods approach was used. In the quantitative phase, we compared the existing health-sector data with World Health Organization (WHO) standards for the availability and use of EmOC services. The qualitative phase included collection and analysis of interviews with midwives and traditional birth attendants and twenty-one in-depth interviews with mothers. The data collected in this phase were managed according to the principles of qualitative data analysis.   \\n RESULTS The findings demonstrate that three distinct factors lead to indecisiveness and delay in the use of EmOC by the midwives and mothers studied. Socio-cultural and familial reasons compel some women to choose to give birth at home and to hesitate seeking professional emergency care for delivery complications. Apprehension about being insulted by physicians, the necessity of protecting their professional integrity in front of patients and an inability to persuade their patients lead to an over-insistence by midwives on completing deliveries at the mothers' homes and a reluctance to refer their patients to hospitals. The low quality and expense of EmOC and the mothers' lack of health insurance also contribute to delays in referral.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Women who choose to give birth at home accept the risk that complications may arise. Training midwives and persuading mothers and significant others who make decisions about the value of referring women to hospitals at the onset of life-threatening complications are central factors to increasing the use of available hospitals. The hospitals must be safe, comfortable and attractive environments for parturition and should give appropriate consideration to the ethical and cultural concerns of the women. Appropriate management of financial and insurance-related issues can help midwives and mothers make a rational decision when complications arise.","target":"True","rationale":"This abstract has a structured format and provides a clear summary of the research.

The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.\\n\\n- The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia.\\n\\n- A gable is the generally triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches. The shape of the gable and how it is detailed depends on the structural system used, which reflects climate, material availability, and aesthetic concerns. A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall, including the gable and the wall below it.\\n\\n- Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.\\n\\n- Fieldstone is a building construction material. Strictly speaking, it is stone collected from the surface of fields where it occurs naturally. Collections of fieldstones which have been removed from arable land or pasture to allow for more effective agriculture are called clearance cairns.\\n\\n- Henrietta Maria of France (25 November 1609  10 September 1669) was queen consort of England, Scotland, and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I. She was mother of his two immediate successors, Charles II and James II.\\n\\n- West Virginia is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States.

Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920.

Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, over the course of a year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates.\\n\\nQ: What is more cost-effective, heat from incandescent bulbs or heat from a building's heating system?","target":"heat from the heating system","rationale":"The question asks about the cost-effectiveness of heat from incandescent bulbs versus heat from a building's heating system.

In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was abolished; no new taxes could be raised without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, also, district offices (Polish: \\"urzędy ziemskie\\") were reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights.

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys. \\nBased on the previous passage, Who called HUD to make sure she was allowed to kick out the tenants? \\nIs \\"Penny\\" a correct answer?","target":"No","rationale":"The passage mentions that Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing in an attempt to find more information regarding her grandmothers rights.

The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut\\n\\nAfter releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2.  1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, \\"Burning Down the House\\". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last.  Three more albums followed: 1985's Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles \\"And She Was\\" and \\"Road to Nowhere\\"), 1986's True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne's musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988's Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group's most successful hits, \\"Wild Wild Life\\", and the accordion-driven track \\"Radio Head\\", which became the etymon of the band of the same name. Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne's control and, after Naked, the band went on \\"hiatus\\".  It took until December 1991 for an official announcement to be made that Talking Heads had broken up. Their final release was \\"Sax and Violins\\", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World. During this breakup period, Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in the summer of 1990.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Talking Heads","rationale":"The context describes the beginning, rise and eventual disbanding of \\"Talking Heads\\".

This opinion holds a certain appeal because if it were true, then we could instantly become ten times more intelligent just by firing up that sleepy majority of the brain!\\nThe idea that we use only a small part of the brain dates back to animal experiments in the 19th century. When scientists stimulated   a specific part of the brain,  the animal moved its leg or tail. If a tiny part of the brain could do something so great, what was the use of the rest of the brain? Some scientists assumed that large parts of the brain were simply useless.\\nThen, in the early 20th century, scientists observed that stimulating certain parts of the brain had no physical effects. They named these seemingly useless parts of the brain the \\"silent cortex.\\" Today we know that in humans, much of the \\"silent cortex\\" is actually devoted to complex activities like language, learning, and imagining.\\nBrain scans have shown that different parts of the brain become much more active as we shift   our attention and focus, but even as we sleep, many areas of the brain are extremely active.

Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.\\n\\nWhich gardener had a soil that takes longer to dry in spring?\\n\\nHint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.","target":"Joe","rationale":"The question asks which gardener, Kat or Joe, had a soil that takes longer to dry in spring. The hint provides information about the benefits and disadvantages of no-tillage farming compared to conventional gardening methods. \\nIt states that “in places with rigorous winter” untilled soil can take longer to warm up and dry out than tilled soils do. Therefore it is more likely for Joe's garden, where he applied the no-tilling method (untilled), will have a slower drying time at the beginning of the growing season than Kat's garden, who used conventional methods (tilled).\\nSo based on this information we can conclude that Joe was most likely using an untilled soil system during his vegetable gardening practice; therefore making him our answer choice!"},{"source":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: During the main titles, Danny Kaye, dressed as a jester, sings the clever song, Life Could Not Better Be, with lyrics that are apropos to the actors or technicians who are being introduced.

The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the church being \\"governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre\\" and established \\"its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler\\", in the words of historian Richard Huscroft. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome. These changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. Pope Innocent was, according to historian Ralph Turner, an \\"ambitious and aggressive\\" religious leader, insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"kings","rationale":"The context of this question is about the relationship between kings and popes, as well as how power was divided in feudal Europe.

According to another study , the Gross-functional product development teams, can achieve a great quality and better cost benefits from socializing and interacting with individuals who work for their suppliers.\\nThe first, Dr. Bohlmann's study analyzed cross-functional product development teams, which combine together engineers, researchers and business personnel. The point to involve people with various backgrounds was to show that there was a focus on finance, marketing, and also on a design and functionality, right from the start of the product-development process. In addition to all this, this diversity also helped to make communication more effective in order to ensure that all members of the team were socializing and cooperating, and not just working at cross-purposes.\\nAs a result, it indicated that \\"interactional fairness awareness\\" indeed had an effect on a \\"cross-functional communication.\\" In other words, all the team members who thought that they had been treated well and respected, showed a great increase in their commitment to the success of the project they had been working on in cooperation with other team members, and, in particular, when they realized their project manager or supervisor to be a kind, nice and honest guy.\\nAccording to Dr. Bohlmann, the increase in such commitment is very essential and important because it could improve performance that would result in the achievement of team goals.

The group was founded by Suffa (Matthew David Lambert) and MC Pressure (Daniel Howe Smith), who were joined by DJ Debris (Barry John M. Francis) after fellow founder, DJ Next (Ben John Hare), left in 1999. The group released its first extended play, Back\\n\\nOn 22 September 2003, Hilltop Hoods released their third album, The Calling, which became a commercial breakthrough. In an interview after the release of their fourth album, Suffa revealed that The Calling was recorded on his mother's computer and the simplicity of their 'studio' is the reason why some of the music on the album is in monaural ('mono') sound.  The Calling entered the ARIA Albums Chart in March 2004 and reached No. 53 before exiting the top 100 in September of the same year. By December 2006 it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 units, becoming the first Australian hip hop album to achieve platinum status. In March 2012, it re-entered the chart and peaked at No. 50 - eight-and-a-half years after its first release. It featured two singles, \\"The Nosebleed Section\\" and \\"Dumb Enough\\", which were listed in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003. \\"The Nosebleed Section\\" was ranked No. 17 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009. Hilltop Hoods' chart and commercial success was a turning point in the Australian Hip Hop scene because it demonstrated widespread support for the genre that reached beyond an underground fan base.  On 1 April 2006, the group followed with their fourth album, The Hard Road, which peaked at number one. It was the first Australian hip hop album to do so. It was certified gold within a week of being released. Its lead single, \\"Clown Prince\\", reached the top 30 on the related ARIA Singles Chart. It featured guest verses from New York rapper, Omni, and British MCs, Mystro and Braintax. The Hilltop Hoods received the inaugural Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for Independent Artist of the Year and Best Performing Independent Album for The Hard Road in 2006. The track, \\"The Blue Blooded\\", is a collaboration with Australian MCs: Funkoars, Hau from Koolism, Mortar, Vents, Drapht, Muph & Plutonic, Pegz and Robby Balboa. On 27 April of the same year, Hilltop Hoods performed at the Bass in the Grass music festival in Darwin alongside fellow hip hop group, The Herd. That same day they issued a second single, the title track from the album. Its video includes fellow members from the Certified Wise Crew - Cross Bred Mongrels, Terrafirma and Funkoars.  Following the success of The Hard Road Tour in early 2006, the Hilltop Hoods began their second national tour for the year, The Stopping All Stations Tour, which visited more regional areas of Australia as well as the capital cities. They were supported by Koolism and Mystro. Late that year, Hilltop Hoods released their third single from the album, \\"What a Great Night\\". The video shows the group at a club with camera shots panning up and down to reveal a new location. It used special effects and is one of the most expensive video clips for an Australian hip hop group, mirroring the group's rise in success and popularity.

The dilution ratio was determined during each calibration by diluting air with oxygen and noting the reduction in the ratio of nitrogen to oxygen. Empiric correction was made by the computer for the effects of density and viscosity, relative to air, on the flow of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and the saturated vapors of the three anesthetics through the capillary resistor. The computer was programmed to control solenoid valves both for calibration and for the multiplexed sampling of operating rooms. Oxygen, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were used as pure gases, and halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane were vaporized at room temperature in 50-ml vaporizers.

This makes learning easy and fun. Students and teachers are excited about the good results it has had on exam marks.

In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, \\"His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'.\\" They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes \\"cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning\\". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with \\"an eye on Mein Kampf\\". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, \\"proving both that it is not just the early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator\\".Vikernes himself has connected the church burnings to an idea of resurgent Viking paganism. The first such burning, that of Fantoft Church on June 6, 1992, was thought by many to be related to Satanism, since the burning occurred on the sixth day of the week, on day six of the sixth month and was thus a reference to the Number of the Beast.

Anggun was awarded Le grand coeur de l'annee (The Great Heart of the Year) by French television network Filles TV for her contribution to social and environmental events.  In February 2007, Anggun was invited as the guest star on one episode of the fourth season of Star Academy Arab World in Lebanon. She returned to another episode of the show's fifth season in the following year. In December 2007, she received her second invitation from the Vatican to perform in the Christmas concert in Verona, Italy, along with Michael Bolton.

She was also featured on the remix version of DJ Laurent Wolf's number-one hit \\"No Stress\\" for the deluxe edition of his album Wash My World. Anggun and Wolf performed the song at the 2008 World Music Awards in Monaco.  In late 2008, Anggun released her fourth international studio album, Elevation, which shares the same title in both English and French. A departure from the style of her previous efforts, the album experimented with urban music and hip hop. Elevation was produced by hip hop producer pair Tefa & Masta and features collaboration with rappers Pras Michel from the Fugees, Sinik, and Big Ali. \\"Crazy\\" was released as the lead single from the album, with its French and Indonesian versions, \\"Si tu l'avoues\\" and \\"Jadi Milikmu\\", serving as the first single in the respective territories. In Russia, Elevation was released with an additional song, \\"O Nas S Toboyu\\", which was recorded as a duet with Russian singer Max Lorens. Prior to its official release, the album had already been certified double platinum, making it the fastest-selling album of her career in Indonesia. In France, the album debuted at number 36 on the French Albums Chart.  Anggun's four-year ambassadress contract with Audemars Piguet was subsequently extended.

Radford, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, envisioned an naval base in the Western Pacific to enhance Seventh Fleet capabilities. The Korean War began and the Navy realized it had a need for an air station in the region. Cubi Point in the Philippines was selected, and civilian contractors were initially approached for the project. After seeing the Zambales Mountains and the surrounding jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The U.S. Navy then turned to the Seabees and was told no problem, Can do. The first Seabees to arrive were surveyors of Construction Battalion Detachment 1802. Moblie Comstruction Battalion 3 arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 also contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the Panama Canal. Seabees there moved of dry fill plus another 15 million that was hydraulic fill. The $100 million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station with an adjacent pier capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. Adjusted-for-inflation, today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53. After decades of use by American forces, Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, burying Cubi Point in 18-36 inches of ash. Despite this, the American government wished to keep the Subic Naval Base and signed a treaty with the Philippine government. The treaty was not ratified, however, failing by a slim margin in the Philippine Senate. Attempts to negotiate a new treaty were soon abandoned and the United States was informed that it was to withdraw within one year. U.S. forces withdrew in November 1992, turning over the facility with its airport to the Philippine government.\\n Passage 3:Zabica started his career with Cockburn City before joining Adelaide City for seven seasons, winning National Soccer League championships in 1992 and 1994.

A nagging knee injury forced his international retirement, but he made a comeback in 1995 with Dalmatinac with whom he won the D'Orsogna Cup. He made his State debut at the age of 31, captaining the side that beat West Ham United in 1995, and went on to play a further five times for Western Australia.

In the second quarter, the Browns got on the board as QB Derek Anderson completed a 19-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  The Texans would regain the lead as kicker Kris Brown managed to get a 41-yard field goal.  However, Cleveland would regain the lead as Anderson completed a 7-yard TD pass to TE Kellen Winslow. In the third quarter, Houston started to fall behind as Browns kicker Phil Dawson managed to get a 25-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Cleveland sealed the win with Dawson nailing a 27-yard field goal and RB Jamal Lewis getting a 1-yard TD run.  The Texans' only response would be Schaub's 6-yard TD pass to TE Owen Daniels.

Nelson Blount, the heir to the largest seafood processor in the United States, was an avid railroad enthusiast.  When he was just seventeen years old he wrote a book on steam power.  Acquiring the narrow-gauge Edaville Railroad in Carver, Massachusetts in 1955, he began amassing one of the largest collections of antique steam locomotives in the United States.  By 1964, another part of his collection housed at North Walpole, New Hampshire consisted of 25 steam locomotives from the United States and Canada, 10 other locomotives, and 25 pieces of rolling stock.  The Monadnock, Steamtown & Northern Railroad, as the enterprise was then called, ran excursions between Keene and Westmoreland, New Hampshire.  In addition to Edaville Railroad and Steamtown, Blount also ran excursions at Pleasure Island in Wakefield, Massachusetts and Freedomland U.S.A. in New York City.  In the early 1960s, Blount came close to entering into an agreement with the state of New Hampshire in which he would donate 20 locomotives to a museum which was to be located in Keene.  However, the plan, which was originally approved by New Hampshire governor Wesley Powell, in 1962, was later rejected by the new governor, John W. King.

But that didnât keep the 5-foot-10  160-pound  Martinez  from tangling with the teamâs biggest star â both in stature and notoriety.\\nCall him Dave or Davey. Doesnât matter. After years of waiting to manage a big league club   Dave Martinez  is just happy to get  his  shot with the Nationals. âI really felt it was time â  Martinez  said. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\\nFists formed. A confrontation brewed. Then  legend has it  in charged  Martinez .\\nâNext thing you know  [Thomas] snapped at me â  Martinez  said of the man known as âThe Big Hurt.â âI was like  âNope. Uh uh.â We both went to the ground.â\\nAccounts of the outcome vary  but most include  Martinez  subduing all 6-feet-5  240 pounds of Thomas in time to spare Ventura.\\nThose who played with him and those who watched him coach at Joe Maddonâs side for the past decade describe  Martinez  as a genuinely friendly guy with a magnetic personality â and an undeniable edge. They said  Martinez  is fearless  not just in the sense that  he  backs down from no one  but also in  his  willingness to stand up to those close to  him .\\nâ Dave Martinez  was always  always  trying to be in the middle just for the good of the team â said Ozzie Guillen  a former manager who is now an ESPN Deportes analyst. â He âs a tough guy.  He âll fight anybody. On the other hand   he  would invite everyone to  his  party. Thatâs the kind of guy  he  is.â\\n Martinez  became Maddonâs most trusted dugout adviser â and one of the most talked-about managerial prospects in the game â over seven seasons with the Tampa Bay Rays and three with the Chicago Cubs because of a unique ability to relate to players. After all  telling opponents they are wrong is one thing. Delivering tough messages to teammates â or  as a coach  to oneâs own  potentially high-profile players â is another.\\nâThe thing Iâve always liked about [ Martinez ] is  he âs never been afraid to have difficult conversations â said Maddon  the Cubs manager. âIt doesnât mean yelling or screaming. It just means being straight up with guys. . . .  He âs not worried about hurting somebodyâs feelings or saying the wrong thing.

At 53   he  has never managed in the minors.  He  has never managed at all.\\nMaddon had his eye on  Martinez  for two decades before their partnership began. He first chased him down in 1983 when  Martinez  was playing in instructional league.  Martinez  was 19  and his play spoke louder than he did.\\nHe was fresh off an uncomfortable stint in Puerto Rican winter ball. Though born to Puerto Rican parents in Brooklyn   Martinez  didnât grow up speaking Spanish  other than occasionally with  his  grandmother. When  he  was 12   his  father sent  him  to live with an uncle in Florida so  he  could play baseball year round  but  he  never quite picked up the language. This was a surprise to Cubs staff when  he  arrived at winter league. The veterans never let  him  live it down.\\nâI like the way you play â  Martinez  said  he  remembers Maddon saying. He all but shrugged it off  not thinking much of the compliment.\\nAlmost 25 years later  a half-decade after  Martinez âs playing career had ended  Maddon asked him to be a guest instructor at Rays spring training in 2006.

The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.\\nIn what year did Lange die?","target":"1900","rationale":"The passage states that Carl Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist who developed the James–Lange theory.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising.

The band currently comprises Tom Chaplin (lead vocals, electric/acoustic guitar), Tim Rice-Oxley (piano, synthesisers, bass guitar, backing vocals), Richard Hughes (drums, percussion, backing vocals), and Jesse Quin (bass guitar, acoustic/electric guitar, backing vocals). Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001. Keane achieved mainstream, international success with the release of their debut album, Hopes and Fears, in 2004.\\n\\nTom Chaplin and Tim Rice-Oxley became friends when very young. Chaplin's father David was the headmaster of Vinehall School in Robertsbridge, East Sussex, (owned by Chaplin's family) for 25 years, the school all three attended until the age of 13. They later attended Tonbridge School in Kent, where Rice-Oxley met Dominic Scott; both of them discovered rapidly their liking for music. Richard Hughes, Keane's future drummer, also attended Tonbridge. Chaplin had also learned to play the flute but none of them considered music as a proper career at the time.  In 1995, while studying at University College London for a degree in classics, Rice-Oxley formed a rock band with Scott, and invited Hughes to play drums. The band, named \\"Lotus Eaters\\", started as a cover band, playing songs by the members' favourite bands, including U2, Oasis, and The Beatles, and rehearsing at home.  After listening to Rice-Oxley's piano playing during a weekend at Virginia Water, Surrey in 1997, Chris Martin invited him to join his newly formed band Coldplay. However, Rice-Oxley declined because he did not want to leave \\"The Lotus Eaters\\", stating, \\"I was seriously interested, but Keane were already operational and Coldplay's keyboard player idea was dropped.\\" Because of Martin's offer, and although Hughes and Scott were originally opposed to it, Chaplin joined the band in 1997, taking Rice-Oxley's place as vocalist and adding himself as the acoustic guitarist. Chaplin's recruitment also marked a change of name from \\"The Lotus Eaters\\" to \\"Cherry Keane\\", after a friend of Chaplin's mother, whom Rice-Oxley and Chaplin knew when they were young. She took care of them and would tell them to go for their dreams. At her death from cancer, she had left money for Chaplin's family. Chaplin commented: \\"I used some of the money to see me through the harder times with the music.\\" The name was shortened to Keane soon afterward.  Chaplin departed for South Africa in the summer of 1997 to work as a volunteer during his gap year. Chaplin's early experiences there would later be reflected in the band's position for the Make Poverty History campaign. Returning a year later, in July 1998, following a meeting with friend David Lloyd Seaman, Hughes' first words when the band picked up Chaplin at the airport were, \\"we've got a gig in ten days.\\" With original material, Keane made their debut live appearance at the \\"Hope & Anchor\\" pub on 13 July 1998. In this same year, Chaplin went to Edinburgh University to study for a degree in art history.

She also stated that the group were in talks to star in their own reality television show regarding the comeback, following on the success of the 2011 Steps reunion and reality show. Hamilton stated that she hoped Katona, who quit the band in 2001, would join her, McClarnon and Frost on stage for a performance. The reunion was later dismissed by all members due to the tension between Katona and Frost. However, on 18 October 2012, it was announced that the 1999 line-up of Atomic Kitten (McClarnon, Katona and Hamilton) would reunite for an ITV2 series, The Big Reunion, along with five other pop groups of their time: 911, Honeyz, B*Witched, Five and Liberty X. Frost had been involved in the early meetings to reform the group, but decided to focus on her pregnancy and was not involved in the reunion.  The groups in The Big Reunion, including Atomic Kitten, were originally supposed to perform a one-off comeback concert at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. Atomic Kitten's setlist for the Hammersmith Apollo concert consisted of \\"Right Now\\", \\"The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)\\", and \\"Whole Again\\". It was confirmed on 11 February that due to high ticket demands and the popularity of the series, a UK arena tour would take place from 3 to 14 May 2013. Two more dates were later added for 16 and 17 May, taking the tour total to 14 shows.  Due to the massive success of The Big Reunion, it was announced that the reunited groups would also be going on a \\"Christmas party tour\\" in December 2013. In December 2013, Atomic Kitten recorded their first new material in ten years when, along with the other groups from the show, they recorded a Christmas charity single for Text Santa, a cover of Wizzard's \\"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\\".

So our mother's characteristics leave an indelible impression, and we are forever after attracted to people with her facial features, body type, personality, even sense of humor. If our mother is warm and giving, as adults  we tend to be attracted to people who are warm and giving. If our mother is strong and even-tempered, we  are going to be attracted to a fair-minded strength in our mates.\\nThe mother has an additional influence on her sons: she not only gives them clues to what they will find attractive in a mate, but also affects how they feel about women in general. So if she is warm and nice, her sons are going to think that's the way women are. They will probably grow up to be warm and responsive lovers and also be cooperative around the house.\\nConversely, a mother who has a depressive personality, and is sometimes friendly but then suddenly turns cold and rejecting, may raise a man who becomes a \\"dance-away lover\\". Because he's been so scared about love from his mother, he's afraid of commitment and may pull away from a girlfriend for this reason.\\nWhile the mother determines in large part what qualities attract us in a mate, it's the father--the first male in our lives--who influences how we relate to the opposite sex. Fathers have an enormous effect on their children's personalities and chances of marital happiness.\\nJust as mothers influence their son's general feelings toward women, fathers influence their daughter's general feelings about men. If a father _ praise on his daughter and demonstrates that she is a worthwhile person, she'll feel very good about herself in relation to men. But if the father is cold, critical or absent, the daughter will tend to feel she's not very lovable or attractive.\\nIn addition, most of us grow up with people of similar social circumstances.

Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial.

Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\".

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

Charlie Baker administered oaths to the 40-member Senate and 160-member House in ceremonies signaling the start of the 191st term for one of America’s oldest legislative bodies. Formally known as the General Court, the Legislature traces its roots to the Colonial era. The first order of business in each chamber — both firmly controlled by Democrats — was the re-election of presiding officers. Rep. Robert DeLeo, of Winthrop, already the longest-serving House speaker in the state’s history having first taken the gavel in 2009, returned for another two-year term. Ashland Democrat Karen Spilka will serve her first full term as Senate president after first assuming the post in July. Speaking in the ornate Senate chamber, which reopened Wednesday for the first time in more than 18 months following a $20 million renovation, Spilka called for several “bold” initiatives in response to what she said were demands from Massachusetts residents to move beyond “small ideas and incremental change.” Spilka said her priorities would include legislation to better control health care spending by reining in the high cost of prescription drugs and redistribute state education funding to better serve children who live in poorer school districts. Recalling the untreated psychological trauma her father suffered as a result of his military service, the Senate leader also appealed for a broad expansion of mental health services throughout the state. “We simply cannot end the epidemic of addiction or solve the problems of chronic homelessness and unemployment, child abuse and neglect, veteran and first responder PTSD, childhood bullying, or repeated incarceration, without first addressing the underlying issue of mental health,” said Spilka. While not specifically calling for tax increases, Spilka said the state would need to “capture new revenues” to support new and existing programs. Spilka, a liberal Democrat, was widely expected to stake out a progressive agenda that could meet resistance in the House, which is also controlled by Democrats but is seen as more conservative than the Senate. Baker, a moderate Republican who remains opposed to any broad-based tax hikes, could also prove a stumbling block. In brief comments following his re-election on Wednesday, DeLeo declared that “no one’s rights will be infringed upon in Massachusetts,” an apparent swipe at the policies of President Donald Trump and other Republicans in Washington. DeLeo generally waits until a few weeks into a new session before outlining his legislative priorities. Sen. Bruce Tarr, of Gloucester, and Rep.

The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\".\\n\\nWith Cain on board, the band began writing material that would eventually lead up to Journey's biggest studio album, \\"Escape\\". Recording sessions began in April 1981, and lasted until the middle of June. Escape was released on July 31, 1981, and immediately the album became a mainstream success. The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts later that year, and included three top-ten hits: \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Open Arms\\". The last is Journey's highest-charting single to date, staying at No. 2 for six consecutive weeks and ranking at No.34 on Billboard's 1982 year-end Hot 100. MTV videotaped one of their two sold-out shows in Houston on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans.  Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600.  This success was met with criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band's albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that \\"Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock.\\" Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time.  Journey's next album, Frontiers (1983), continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts, selling nearly six million copies. The album generated four Top 40 hits, \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\", which reached No. 8, \\"Faithfully\\", which reached No. 12, \\"Send Her My Love\\" and \\"After the Fall\\", both of which reached No. 23. By this time, Journey had become one of the top touring and recording bands in the world.

His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker, where he made several high-profile and sometimes controversial covers. He is married to designer and editor\\nContext: Hired by Tina Brown as a contributing artist in 1992, Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years. Spiegelman's first cover appeared on the February 15, 1993, Valentine's Day issue and showed a black West Indian woman and a Hasidic man kissing. The cover caused turmoil at The New Yorker offices. Spiegelman intended it to reference the Crown Heights riot of 1991 in which racial tensions led to the murder of a Jewish yeshiva student. Spiegelman had twenty-one New Yorker covers published, and submitted a number which were rejected for being too outrageous.  Within The New Yorker's pages, Spiegelman contributed strips such as a collaboration titled \\"In the Dumps\\" with children's illustrator Maurice Sendak and an obituary to Charles M. Schulz titled \\"Abstract Thought is a Warm Puppy\\". An essay he had published there on Jack Cole, the creator of Plastic Man, called \\"Forms Stretched to their Limits\\" was to form the basis for a book in 2001 about Cole called Jack Cole and Plastic Man: Forms Stretched to their Limits.  The same year, Voyager Company published a CD-ROM version of Maus with extensive supplementary material called The Complete Maus, and Spiegelman illustrated a 1923 poem by Joseph Moncure March called The Wild Party. Spiegelman contributed the essay \\"Getting in Touch With My Inner Racist\\" in the September 1, 1997 issue of Mother Jones.  Spiegelman's influence and connections in New York cartooning circles drew the ire of political cartoonist Ted Rall in 1999. In an article titled \\"The King of Comix\\" in The Village Voice, Rall accused Spiegelman of the power to \\"make or break\\" a cartoonist's career in New York, while denigrating Spiegelman as \\"a guy with one great book in him\\". Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded by sending a forged email under Rall's name to thirty professionals; the prank escalated until Rall launched a defamation suit against Hellman for $1.5 million. Hellman published a \\"Legal Action Comics\\" benefit book to cover his legal costs, to which Spiegelman contributed a back-cover cartoon in which he relieves himself on a Rall-shaped urinal.  In 1997, Spiegelman had his first children's book published: Open Me... I'm a Dog, with a narrator who tries to convince its readers that it is a dog via pop-ups and an attached leash. From 2000 to 2003 Spiegelman and Mouly edited three issues of the children's comics anthology Little Lit, with contributions from Raw alumni and children's book authors and illustrators.\\nQuestion: What was \\"In the Dumps\\"?.

Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52 of the intended 120 spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940. By then the decline in the population of the City of London had reduced the congregation to less than 80, and the parishes of St Leonard, Foster Lane and Christ Church Greyfriars were merged with nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.St Botolph's Aldersgate remains open as a functioning church.

If you are married, company pension plans generally require a notarized signature of your spouse, who will be giving up his/her right to an annuity interest, in order for you to move the money into your IRA. When planning for a rollover, there are several other rules to keep in mind. For example, if you are age 55 or older when the separation from service occurs, you may take your company pension as a lump sum distribution without paying the 10% early withdrawal excise tax. You will be taxed on the distribution as ordinary income. What is a pension? Do I have to do anything to manage my pension? What if I leave my company before I retire? How does vesting work? When can I access my pension money? Can I take out a loan from my pension plan? Should I take a lump-sum payout or monthly payments? What are the advantages of taking a lump sum? Should I invest my lump-sum payout in an annuity? What's the difference between a single-life annuity and a joint-and-survivor annuity? Will I pay tax on my pension payouts? How should my pension affect my retirement planning? While you can opt to tap your 401k at any time you can’t collect your pension until you’ve reached the predetermined retirement age. Nope. While you can opt to tap your 401(k) at any time (though you’ll pay a huge penalty to do so before age 59.5), you… Not until you reach retirement age. Typically that's 65, though many pension plans allow you to start collecting early retirement benefits as early as age 55. If you decide to start receiving benefits before you reach full retirement age, the size of your monthly payout will be less than it would have been if you'd waited. Ask the folks who run your plan to create a simple table showing you how your payments will vary depending on when you start. However, pension plans are required to withhold 20% of the proceeds if the check is made payable to you. This means in order to roll 100% of your pension distribution into an IRA, you will need to come up with the tax withholding out of your own pocket. Otherwise you will owe taxes on the money you didn’t rollover and possibly a tax penalty if you are under age 55. Nope.

A further split of the radicales faction into two sub-factions led by Manuel Gondra and Eduardo Schaerer respectively, gradually escalated into a full-scale civil war. In 1920, Gondra came out victorious in the presidential election. Schaerer immediately attempted to undermine Gondra by forcing the resignation of Interior Minister José Guggiari, Gondra's most vocal supporter. After Gondra's refusal to dismiss Guggiari, Gondra himself resigned, due to the emergence of a split in Paraguay's armed forces. After Vice President Félix Paiva's refusal to assume office, the congress placed senator Eusebio Ayala, a moderate Gondra supporter into interim presidency. Another crisis ensued when Adolfo Chirife, a supporter of Schaerer, became a presidential candidate.

He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album Pru.Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: \\"From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio.

At the moment, the majority of cloned mice, sheep and other animals die before birth. It is thought this is because the adult DNA is not properly 'reprogrammed'.\\nUsing flies, researchers might discover genes that are important for this reprogramming, and that have matches in other animals. That is because it is relatively easy in flies to knock out the function of a single gene and then attempt cloning with these cells, which will test whether that gene is important. If such genes are confirmed, then in theory cloned mammalian embryos  might be grown in selected solutions that change the activity of those genes to improve the technique's success rate.

The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 °C (69.8 °F). In winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 °C (33.8 °F) or 2 °C (35.6 °F) are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around 700 mm (28 in).

The Greek campaign was launched primarily because the western Allies, particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, recently defeated in World War I. The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in Smyrna , on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, including the cities of Manisa, Balıkesir, Aydın, Kütahya, Bursa and Eskişehir. Their advance was checked at the Battle of Sakarya in 1921 by forces of the Turkish national movement. The Greek front collapsed with the Turkish counter-attack in August 1922, and the war effectively ended with the recapture of Smyrna by the Turkish forces and the Great Fire of Smyrna. As a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish national movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving East Thrace and Western Anatolia to Turkey.

Projected coronary arteriograms were digitized into 512 X 512 pixel mode and percent stenosis was calculated by comparing background-corrected videodensitometric values over stenotic and normal segments. Subjects underwent repeat coronary arteriography because of worsening symptoms of angina or heart failure; subjects with renal failure, coronary artery bypass grafts or cardiac transplant were excluded. Clinical variables determined at the time of the first arteriogram included age, sex, serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and presence or absence of cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus and left ventricular hypertrophy. The mean interval between arteriograms was 29.3 months. Overall progression of coronary stenosis was observed in 40 of the 44 subjects; the mean progression at 24 months was 39% (90% confidence interval, 33 to 45%) and at 36 months was 48% (40 to 56%). The degree of overall progression was related to the length of time between arteriograms (F = 5.81, p less than 0.05) and to serum cholesterol level (F = 4.37, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that using an accurate, quantitative method, it is possible to measure progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis within 2 to 3 years of the initial arteriogram. Serum cholesterol appears to be an important determinant of disease progression. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Child, Preschool","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that measured progression of coronary artery stenosis in 144 arterial segments from 44 subjects with coronary artery disease.

Passage 1:The conflict emerged from the First Indochina War against the communist-led Viet Minh. Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. After the French quit Indochina in 1954, the US assumed financial and military support for the South Vietnamese state. The Việt Cộng, also known as or NLF (the National Liberation Front), a South Vietnamese common front under the direction of North Vietnam, initiated a guerrilla war in the south. North Vietnam had also invaded Laos in the mid-1950s in support of insurgents, establishing the Ho Chi Minh Trail to supply and reinforce the Việt Cộng. U.S. involvement escalated under President John F. Kennedy through the MAAG program from just under a thousand military advisors in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. By 1963, the North Vietnamese had sent 40,000 soldiers to fight in South Vietnam. North Vietnam was heavily backed by the USSR and the People's Republic of China. China also sent hundreds of PLA servicemen to North Vietnam to serve in air-defense and support roles.\\n Passage 2:Born in Philadelphia, Day studied at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University and at the Curtis Institute of Music where she was a pupil of Margaret Harshaw.

Remix album Money Is Still a Major Issue was released in November 2005; it included new track \\"Everybody Get Up\\", a duet with hip-hop/R&B group Pretty Ricky.  TVT Records, Pitbull's label at the time, and Slip-n-Slide Records disputed over the release of Welcome to the 305, an unreleased album by Slip-n-Slide that Pitbull had recorded in 2001. A Miami judge ruled that Slip-n-Slide had a legal right to release the album as it was recorded when Pitbull was a Slip-N-Slide artist, and prior to him signing with TVT Records. A U.S. District Court judge affirmed the decision further. TVT was then ordered in March 2007 to pay Slip-n-Slide $9.1 million for attempting to block the album's release to record stores and digital download entities.

The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.\\n\\n- The Southern United States, commonly referred to as the American South, Dixie, or simply the South, is a region of the United States of America. The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations. However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South.\\n\\n- Greenwich is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 61,171. The largest town on Connecticut's Gold Coast, it is home to many hedge funds and other financial service companies. Greenwich is the southernmost and westernmost municipality in Connecticut as well as the six-state region of New England. It is 38+ minutes by train (express) from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. CNN/Money and \\"Money\\" magazine ranked Greenwich first on its list of the \\"100 Best Places to Live in the United States\\" in 2005. The town is named after Greenwich, a borough of London in the United Kingdom.\\n\\n- Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York to northern Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. While the Appalachian Mountains stretch from Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador) in Canada to Cheaha Mountain in Alabama, the cultural region of Appalachia typically refers only to the central and southern portions of the range. As of the 2010 United States Census, the region was home to approximately 25 million people.\\n\\n- Townsquare Media (formerly Regent Communications until 2010) is an American media company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The company started in radio and expanded into digital media toward the end of the 2000s, starting with the acquisition of the MOG Music Network and later a group of former blogs owned by AOL. As of 2016, Townsquare was the third-largest AMFM operator in the country, owning over 310 radio stations in 66 markets.\\n\\n- KXGE ( 102.3 FM ) is a radio station broadcasting a mainstream rock format serving the Dubuque , Iowa , USA community .

The membrane, or head, is typically made of plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally but rarely used, and the frame is typically circular. Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by Africans in America, adapted from African instruments of similar design.\\n\\n- A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.\\n\\n- AOL Inc. (simply known as AOL, originally known as America Online) is an American multinational mass media corporation based in New York, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications. The company owns and operates websites such as \\"The Huffington Post\\", TechCrunch and Engadget, and spans digital distribution of content, products, and services, which it offers to consumers, publishers, and advertisers.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n- Dubuque is the county seat of Dubuque County, Iowa, United States, located along the Mississippi River. In 2013, its population was 58,253, making it the tenth-largest city in the state\\n\\n- The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\\n\\n- Hillbilly is a term (often derogatory) for people who dwell in rural, mountainous areas in the United States, primarily in Appalachia and the Ozarks, Uwharrie Mountains, and Caraway Mountains. Due to its strongly stereotypical connotations, the term can be offensive to those Americans of Appalachian or Ozark heritage. The first known instances of \\"Hillbilly\\" in print were in \\"The Railroad Trainmen's Journal\\" (vol. ix, July 1892), a 1899 photograph of men and women in West Virginia labeled \\"Camp Hillbilly\\" andin a 1900 \\"New York Journal\\" article, with the definition: \\"a Hill-Billie is a free and untrammeled white citizen of Tennessee, who lives in the hills, has no means to speak of, dresses as he can, talks as he pleases, drinks whiskey when he gets it, and fires off his revolver as the fancy takes him\\". The stereotype is twofold in that it incorporates both positive and negative traits: \\"Hillbillies\\" are often considered independent and self-reliant individuals who resist the modernization of society, but at the same time they are also defined as backward and violent. Scholars argue this duality is reflective of the split ethnic identities in white America.\\n\\n- The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.\\n\\n- Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. \\n\\n- A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world.\\n\\n- Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music.\\n\\n- Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions.\\n\\n- Mainstream rock (also known as heritage rock) is a radio format used by many commercial radio stations in the United States and Canada.\\n\\n- Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.\\n\\n- The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'kxge' exhibits the relationship of 'located in the administrative territorial entity'.

For most of us, pain avoidance isn't limited to one situation. It applies to almost anything that's painful. Most of us try our best never to leave a comfort zone.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death.\\nThe daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.\\nIn 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia.

A typical clause consists of a subject and a predicate, the latter typically a verb phrase, a verb with any objects and other modifiers. However, the subject is sometimes not expressed, often the case in null-subject languages if the subject is retrievable from context, but it sometimes also occurs in other languages such as English (as in imperative sentences and non-finite clauses).\\n\\n- In written language, a logogram or logograph is a written character that represents a word or phrase. Chinese characters and Japanese kanji are logograms; some Egyptian hieroglyphs and some graphemes in cuneiform script are also logograms. The use of logograms in writing is called \\"logography\\". A writing system that is based on logograms is called a \\"logographic system\\".\\n\\n- A planned or constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary have been consciously devised for human or human-like communication, instead of having developed naturally. It is also referred to as an artificial or invented language. There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as: to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code), to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning, for artistic creation, and for language games.\\n\\n- Esperanto (or ; in Esperanto: ) is a constructed international auxiliary language. It is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world. The Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof published the first book detailing Esperanto, \\",\\" on 26 July 1887. The name of Esperanto derives from \\" (\\"\\" translates as \\"one who hopes\\"), the pseudonym under which Zamenhof published Unua Libro.\\n\\n- Esperanto is written in a Latin alphabet of twenty - eight letters , with upper and lower case . This is supplemented by punctuation marks and by various logograms , such as the numerals 0 -- 9 , currency signs such as $ , and mathematical symbols . Twenty - two of the letters are identical in form to letters of the English alphabet ( q , w , x , and y being omitted ) . The remaining six have diacritic marks ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  ( that is , c , g , h , j , and s circumflex , and u breve ) . The full alphabet is : In handwritten Esperanto , the diacritics pose no problem . However , since they do n't appear on standard alphanumeric keyboards , various alternate methods have been devised for representing them in printed and typed text . The original method was a set of digraphs now known as the \`\` h - system '' , but with the rise of computer word processing a so - called \`\` x-system '' has become equally popular . These systems are described below . However , with the advent of Unicode , the need for such work - arounds has lessened . Unique to the Esperanto script is the spesmilo ( 1000 specie ) sign , an Sm monogram for a now - obsolete international unit of auxiliary Esperanto currency used by a few British and Swiss banks before World War I. It has been assigned the Unicode value U +20B7 , though in ordinary fonts it is often transcribed as Sm , usually italic .\\n\\n- Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof (), usually credited as L. L. Zamenhof, was a Polish-Jewish medical doctor, inventor, and writer. He is most widely known for creating Esperanto, the most successful constructed language in the world. He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war and believed that this could happen with the help of a new international auxiliary language, which he first developed in 1873 while still in school.\\n\\n- Dr. Esperanto's International Language, usually referred to as Unua Libro, was the first publication to describe Esperanto, then called the International Language. It was first published in Russian on July 26, 1887 in Warsaw, by Polish oculist L. L. Zamenhof. Over the next few years editions were published in Polish, Russian, Hebrew, French, German, and English. This booklet included the Lord's Prayer, some Bible verses, a letter, poetry, the sixteen rules of grammar and 900 roots of vocabulary. In the book Zamenhof declared, \\"an international language, like a national one, is common property\\" and renounced all rights to the language, effectively putting it into the public domain. Zamenhof signed the work as \\"Doktoro Esperanto\\" (Doctor One-Who-Hopes). Those who learned the new language began to call it \\"Esperanto\\" after Zamenhof's pen name, and Esperanto soon became the official name of the language.\\n\\n- An international auxiliary language (sometimes abbreviated as IAL or auxlang) or interlanguage is a language meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language. An auxiliary language is primarily a second language.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'esperanto orthography' has the relation 'instance of' with?","target":"writing","rationale":"Esperanto orthography is a writing system that was proposed by Zamenhof and adopted in 1887. It contains four main types of linguistics entities: punctuation, logogram, diacritic mark and letter. A typical clause consists of both subject(subjective) and predicate (objective). However , the thing that makes esperanto stand out from other language systems are its usages for written communication between people who do not speak each others' languages . In order to express their thoughts clearly when they write it down on paper or type it on computer screen , one must use some kind of grammar structure which has been designed specifically with this purpose in mind .

Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.","target":"Sarahn","rationale":"The continents on Sarahn are breaking apart, forming new oceanic crust. This newly formed volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than the old oceanic crust that has been stable for a long time on Timon. Therefore, the answer is Sarahn."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a context, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and an answer term.

It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to Britain via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route.

His father, born in Bangor, Maine, ran a harness shop (after an erratic career as a salesman, prospector, storekeeper and bowling-alley operator), but his real passion was bowling, and he eventually returned to it as a business. Anna Hopkins, born in Hamilton, Ontario, had moved at an early age to Vermillion, South Dakota, where she married David. She was deeply religious and active in the affairs of the Methodist church.\\n\\nIn March 1933, Roosevelt summoned Hopkins to Washington as federal relief administrator. Convinced that paid work was psychologically more valuable than cash handouts, Hopkins sought to continue and expand New York State's work-relief programs, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration. He supervised the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Over 90% of the people employed by the Hopkins programs were unemployed or on relief. He feuded with Harold Ickes, who ran a rival program--the Public Works Administration--which also created jobs but did not require applicants to be unemployed or on relief.  FERA, the largest program from 1933 to 1935, involved giving money to localities to operate work relief projects to employ those on direct relief. CWA was similar but did not require workers to be on relief in order to receive a government sponsored job. In less than four months, the CWA hired four million people, and during its five months of operation, the CWA built and repaired 200 swimming pools, 3,700 playgrounds, 40,000 schools, 250,000 miles (400,000 km) of road, and 12 million feet of sewer pipe.  The WPA, which followed the CWA, employed 8.5 million people in its seven-year history, working on 1.4 million projects, including the building or repair of 103 golf courses, 1,000 airports, 2,500 hospitals, 2,500 sports stadiums, 3,900 schools, 8,192 parks, 12,800 playgrounds, 124,031 bridges, 125,110 public buildings, and 651,087 miles (1,047,823 km) of highways and roads. The WPA operated on its own, and on selected projects in cooperation with local and state governments, but always with its own staff and budget. Hopkins started programs for youth (National Youth Administration) and for artists and writers (Federal One Programs). He and Eleanor Roosevelt worked together to publicize and defend New Deal relief programs. He was concerned with rural areas but increasingly focused on cities in the Great Depression.  Before Hopkins began to decline from his struggle with stomach cancer in the late 1930s, FDR appeared to be training him as a possible successor.

In history, scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. In literature and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. In communication studies, scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in ethology, a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

The concentrations of the elements Cs, Cu, Fe, and Mn in serum and packed cells appeared to be maintained within the normal range, while the levels of the non-essential element Br in both serum and packed cells were subnormal. The serum Cr values were extremely high (20 to 50 times higher than the normal serum level). The amount of Cr absorbed from the dialysate was calculated to be ten times higher than the daily dietary uptake. The Co concentrations were normal in packed cells but were significantly increased in serum. The Rb content in packed cells was slightly lower than normal, while the serum value was normal. Se was maintained within the normal range in packed cells, but the serum concentration was slightly lower than normal. The concentrations of Zn were low in serum and appeared to be higher than normal in packed cells. In conclusion, this analysis of the trace element status of CAPD patients reveals two major abnormalities. There is an apparent loss of Br from the blood towards the dialysate and on the other hand, a dramatic accumulation of Cr into the blood as a result of the very high Cr content in the dialysate. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Trace elements in serum, packed cells, and dialysate of CAPD patients. option2: Are the holidays hazardous to your patients' health?

Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, scientist, engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar. Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court.\\n\\nZhang Heng's mechanical inventions influenced later Chinese inventors such as Yi Xing, Zhang Sixun, Su Song, and Guo Shoujing. Su Song directly named Zhang's water-powered armillary sphere as the inspiration for his 11th-century clock tower. The cosmic model of nine points of Heaven corresponding with nine regions of earth conceived in the work of the scholar-official Chen Hongmou (1696-1771) followed in the tradition of Zhang's book Spiritual Constitution of the Universe. The seismologist John Milne, who created the modern seismograph in 1876 alongside Thomas Gray and James A. Ewing at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, commented in 1886 on Zhang Heng's contributions to seismology. The historian Joseph Needham emphasized his contributions to pre-modern Chinese technology, stating that Zhang was noted even in his day for being able to \\"make three wheels rotate as if they were one.\\" More than one scholar has described Zhang as a polymath. However, some scholars also point out that Zhang's writing lacks concrete scientific theories. Comparing Zhang with his contemporary, Ptolemy (83-161) of Roman Egypt, Jin Guantao, Fan Hongye, and Liu Qingfeng state:  Based on the theories of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on the basis of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.  Here we can see how important the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as a model for the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Zhang Heng","rationale":"Zhang Heng is the subject of the text.

On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \\"Leo\\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matias, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.\\n\\nMessi's place in Argentina's Copa America Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1-0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa America warm-up match on 27 May 2016. It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region, but that he would remain in Martino's squad for the tournament, although he was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2-1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness. Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernandez in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Aguero's goal, as the match ended in a 5-0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition; he was elected man of the match for his performance.  On 18 June 2016, in the quarter-final of the Copa America against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance, assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4-1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches. This record was broken three days later when Messi scored in a 4-0 win in the semi-final of the Copa America against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year, and was named man of the match once again.  During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0-0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football. Sources reported that other Argentine players - Sergio Aguero, Javier Mascherano, Gonzalo Higuain, Lucas Biglia, Ever Banega, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Angel Di Maria - could follow their captain in retiring from international football. Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, \\"My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.\\" Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sanchez.\\n\\nWho coached the team at the time?","target":"Martino's","rationale":"The question asks about the coach at a specific time: \\"at the time\\".

The Creeks rose up as the largest deerskin supplier, and the increase in supply only intensified European demand for deerskins. Native Americans continued to negotiate the most lucrative trade deals by forcing England, France, and Spain to compete for their supply of deerskins. In the 1750s and 1760s, the Seven Years' War disrupted France's ability to provide manufactures goods to its allies, the Choctaws and Chickasaw. The French and Indian War further disrupted trade, as the British blockaded French goods. The Cherokees allied themselves with France, who were driven out from the southeast in accordance with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The British were now the dominant trading power in the southeast.  While both the Cherokee and the Creek were the main trading partners of the British, their relationships with the British were different. The Creeks adapted to the new economic trade system, and managed to hold onto their old social structures. Originally Cherokee land was divided into five districts; however, the number soon grew to thirteen districts with 200 hunters assigned per district due to deerskin demand.  Charleston and Savannah were the main trading ports for the export of deerskins. Deerskins became the most popular export, and monetarily supported the colonies with the revenue produced by taxes on deerskins. Charleston's trade was regulated by the Indian Trade Commission, composed of traders who monopolized the market and profited off the sale of deerskins. From the beginning of the 18th century to mid-century, the deerskin exports of Charleston more than doubled in exports. Charleston received tobacco and sugar from the West Indies and rum from the North in exchange for deerskins. In return for deerskins, Great Britain sent woolens, guns, ammunition, iron tools, clothing, and other manufactured goods that were traded to the Native Americans.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Were there any wars or conflicts that disrupted the fur trade during this period?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"Seven Years' War","rationale":"The answer is Seven Years' War, since the context states that this war disrupted France's ability to provide manufactured goods.\\n\\"\\""},{"source":"In this task, you are given inputs i,j, and A, where i and j are integers and A is a list.

His parents were Rabbi Mayer Samuel Weisz (1829-1892) and Cecilia Steiner (1841-1913). Houdini was one of seven children: Herman M. (1863-1885) who was Houdini's half-brother, by Rabbi Weisz's first marriage; Nathan J. (1870-1927); Gottfried William (1872-1925); Theodore (1876-1945); Leopold D. (1879-1962); and Carrie Gladys (1882-1959), who was left almost blind after a childhood accident. Weisz arrived in the United States on July 3, 1878, on the SS Fresia with his mother (who was pregnant) and his four brothers.\\n\\nHoudini performed at least three variations on a buried alive stunt during his career. The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, and it almost cost Houdini his life. Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep. He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig his way to the surface and called for help. When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants. Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was \\"very dangerous\\" and that \\"the weight of the earth is killing.\\"  Houdini's second variation on buried alive was an endurance test designed to expose mystical Egyptian performer Rahman Bey, who had claimed to use supernatural powers to remain in a sealed casket for an hour. Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining in a sealed casket, or coffin, submerged in the swimming pool of New York's Hotel Shelton for one and a half hours. Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing. He repeated the feat at the YMCA in Worcester, Massachusetts on September 28, 1926, this time remaining sealed for one hour and eleven minutes.  Houdini's final buried alive was an elaborate stage escape that featured in his full evening show. Houdini would escape after being strapped in a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then buried in a large tank filled with sand. While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting \\"Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!\\"), it is unclear whether Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage. The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926. The bronze casket Houdini created for buried alive was used to transport Houdini's body from Detroit to New York following his death on Halloween.

One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries.\\nJeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular abilities such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog, Ellington), and telekinesis. Confiding this to his parents Ted and Maxine, they convince him to use his powers to help the community. His mother designs a costume and as the Meteor Man, he takes on the Golden Lords.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3).

All subjects had documented progression of deformity, with an average curvature of 34 degrees. The average ages for scoliotics and 18 control subjects were 16.1 and 20.8 years, respectively. Controls had no spinal deformity and underwent identical test procedures. The test results showed that scoliotic subjects had significant asymmetry between right and left limbs in their threshold for detection of joint motion (p less than or equal to 0.005) and in their ability to reproduce angles to which their elbow joint had been previously positioned (p less than or equal to 0.025). Slight asymmetry also was observed in the reproduction tests of the control group (p less than or equal to 0.013); however, there was no significant asymmetry seen in this group for the threshold test. Performance of bilateral limbs was designated good and bad for both groups; the limb that performed better in proprioceptive function was designated good limb. Analysis of data showed that the scoliotics' good and bad limbs performed inferiorly in both threshold and angle reproduction tests when compared with normal controls.

Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game, and unlike movie rentals, a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day. Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals, but didn't take any formal legal action until Blockbuster Video began to make game rentals a large-scale service. Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive up the cost of games. Nintendo lost the lawsuit, but did win on a claim of copyright infringement. Blockbuster was banned from including original, copyrighted instruction booklets with their rented games. In compliance with the ruling, Blockbuster produced their own short instructions—usually in the form of a small booklet, card, or label stuck on the back of the rental box—that explained the game's basic premise and controls. Video rental shops continued the practice of renting video games and still do today.","target":"Nintendo Entertainment System","rationale":"The paragraph is about the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and how it grew in popularity.

There are similarities, of course, but the cops (policemen) don't think much of them.\\n       The first difference is that a policeman's real life revolves round (......) the law. Most of his training is in criminal law. He has to know exactly what actions are crimes and what evidence can be used to prove them in court. He has to know nearly as much law as a professional lawyer, and what is more, he has to apply it on his feet, in the dark and rain, running down an alley   after someone he wants to talk to.\\n       Little of his time is spent in chatting to charming ladies or in dramatic confrontations   with desperate criminals. He will spend most of his working life typing millions of words on thousands of forms about hundreds of sad, unimportant people who are guilty -- or not -- of stupid crimes of little importance.\\n       Most television crime drama is about finding the criminal: as soon as he's arrested, the story is over. In real life, finding criminals is seldom much of a problem. Except in very serious cases like murders and terrorist attacks-- where failure to produce results reflects on the standing of the police -- little effort is spent on searching. The police have detailed machinery which eventually shows up most wanted men.\\n       Having made an arrest, a detective really starts to work. He has to prove his case in court and to do that he often has to gather a lot of different evidence. Much of this has to be given by people who don't want to get involved in a court case. So, as well as being overworked, a detective has to be out at all hours of the day and night interviewing his witnesses and persuading them, usually against their own best interests, to help him.\\n       A third big difference between the drama detective and the real detective is that the real detective lives in an unpleasant moral twilight  .

Their debut album Emmerdale (1994) gave them a solid base in their home country and enjoyed some success abroad, especially in Japan. It was not until their second album Life (1995) that an international reputation was secured. Their popularity rose when their single \\"Lovefool\\", from the album First Band on the Moon (1996), was included in the soundtrack to the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet.\\nContext: The Cardigans returned in 2002 to record Long Gone Before Daylight (2003), a collection of songs mainly written by Persson and Svensson. Long Gone Before Daylight became one of the best selling albums in Sweden in 2003. After a two-year hiatus from their last album, it was released in Japan on March 19, 2003 and in Europe on March 24, 2003. Later it was also released in Canada (April 22, 2003) and the United States (May 25, 2004).  The album differs from the band's earlier works. Their familiar \\"happy\\" pop sound takes on a change to pop songs with more of an American country music influence. It is a much darker album than their previous works, and quieter than Gran Turismo. Indeed, even lead singer Nina Persson dyed her once light blonde hair to jet black, reflecting the band's change of mood. The album was produced by Per Sunding after the group's regular producer Tore Johanssen stepped down, feeling himself unable to provide the country sound the group wanted.  Criticism was generally mixed to positive. Some found the change of direction welcome, and felt the band had matured, making songs that were even better than other experienced country-pop styled artists. Others missed the old pop sound, and accused the band of possibly being ashamed of their former \\"happy\\" pop sound. The first single of the album, \\"For What It's Worth\\" was released on February 17, 2003. The second single was \\"You're the Storm\\" released on June 2, 2003. The third and final single was \\"Live and Learn\\" released on December 3, 2003. In the summer of 2004, The Cardigans toured with Liz Phair, Katy Rose and Charlotte Martin on the Chicks With Attitude tour.  On 28 April 2005 the band's iTunes Originals album was released through iTunes. On 19 October 2005 the band released their sixth album Super Extra Gravity to generally favourable reviews. Super Extra Gravity went straight to the #1 spot on the Swedish album chart and was certified gold (sales over 40,000). After the band finished promotional activities in fall 2006, the band entered an extended hiatus and devoted themselves to other projects.\\nQuestion: was Long Gone Before Daylight a hit?.

According to legend , Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823 , thus creating the rugby - style of play . Although the story has become firmly entrenched in the sport 's folklore , it is not supported by substantive evidence , and is discounted by most rugby historians as an origin myth . The William Webb Ellis Cup is presented to the winners of the Rugby World Cup .\\n\\n- Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.\\n\\n- Thomas Arnold (13 June 1795  12 June 1842) was an English educator and historian. Arnold was an early supporter of the Broad Church Anglican movement. He was the headmaster of Rugby School from 1828 to 1841, where he introduced a number of reforms.\\n\\n- Rugby league football, usually called rugby league, is a full contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field. One of the two codes of rugby football, it originated in England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to players. Its rules gradually changed with the aim of producing a faster, more entertaining game for spectators.\\n\\n- Rugby is a market town in Warwickshire, England, close to the River Avon. The town has a population of 70,628\\n(2011 census) making it the second largest town in the county. The enclosing Borough of Rugby has a population of 100,500 (2011 census).\\n\\n- Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line.\\n\\n- Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word \\"football\\" is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called 'football' in certain places include: association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football codes.\\n\\n- Rugby School is a day and boarding public school (private and co-educational) in Rugby, Warwickshire, England. It is one of the oldest private schools in Britain. In many ways the stereotype of the English public school is a reworking of Thomas Arnold's Rugby. It is one of the original seven English public schools defined by the Public Schools Act 1868. Rugby School enrols boarding and day students, with a total student enrolment of 800 in day student grades 4 to 12. For the academic year 2015/16, Rugby charges boarders up to £10,995 per term, making it the 39th most expensive HMC boarding school.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'william webb ellis' exhibits the relationship of 'sport'.

However, I always have this underlying fear that she'll revert back to the way she was before. On the other hand, my dad and stepmom currently have a great marriage, despite the hiccups.

She'd taken me coming out very well, and she supported me in all my hobbies, etc. I don't hate her by any means, but she just makes me uncomfortable.\\n\\nA week ago, my stepmom left for a few days to visit her son in Colorado, so my dad and I were by ourselves.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]","target":"specimen B","rationale":"A brown rot fungus is a type of wood-decay fungus that attacks dead trees.

Then we can replace the last character in password (\\".\\") with a new alphabetical character, \\"V\\". Then we can insert a new alphabetical character in front of the digit 2. We now have password = V2NHUQpHTlH5oSN1IcQIl5awxUGabhjK2MHus!AILu3erdl. Next, we can add one more lowercase letter at the end of password and then add one more uppercase letter at the end of password. Now we have: V2NHUQpHTlH5oSN1IcQIl5awxUGabhjK2MHus!AILu3erdlmP . At this point, there are two options for making our string stronger: (a) delete all characters from index 17 till 27; or (b) keeping all original characters and adding exactly 3 characters to make it stronger.

In order to make our string stronger by just adding 3 characters after index 16, we need 1 lowercase letter + 1 uppercase letter + 1 digit = 30 choices * 30 choices * 10 choices = 90000 possibilities per choice location -> 90000 * 90000 * 90000 = 729 billion combinations overall -> 729 billion / 60 seconds per minute / 60 minutes per hour / 24 hours per day ~= 5 days to try all combinations -> 5 days \\\\* 4 weeks/month \\\\* 12 months/year ~= 240 years.

If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'.\\n\\nAbstract: The origin of Merkel cells is still a matter of debate, specifically the question of whether they are derived from epithelial cells of the epidermis or from immigrated neural crest cells. As an argument for the latter hypothesis the occurrence of dermal, nerve-associated Merkel cells in human fetal skin has often been mentioned. Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of Merkel cells in epidermis and dermis of plantar skin of human embryos and fetuses, ranging in gestational age between 7 and 17 weeks. Merkel cells were identified by immunocytochemistry on frozen sections using antibodies against simple epithelium-type cytokeratins and by electron microscopy. In the 17-week-old fetus, 17% of the total cutaneous (epidermal and dermal) Merkel cells were located in the upper dermal compartment, whereas in the 14-week-old fetus only 3.9% of the Merkel cells were dermal, including some cells that seemed to be in the process of traversing the dermal-epidermal junction. Thirteen-week-old fetuses showed even fewer dermal Merkel cells. Twelve-week-old fetuses exhibited 660 epidermal Merkel cells per 100 mm total section length, but none in the upper or deep dermis. In 7- to 9-week embryos, no Merkel cells were recognized. However, at this stage, but not in later stages, the basal cells of the plantar epidermis expressed certain simple epithelium-type cytokeratin polypeptides. These results speak against an invasion of Merkel cells or putative neural crest-derived precursor cells into the epidermis via a dermal passage. They suggest that in plantar skin Merkel cells arise, between weeks 8-12, from precursor stages of epithelial cells of the early fetal epidermis which still express simple epithelium-type cytokeratins. The results further suggest that in subsequent stages of skin development some epidermal Merkel cells detach from the epithelium and migrate into the upper dermis where some of them may associate with small nerves. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Antibodies, Monoclonal 3)Mice","target":"No","rationale":"None of these three options are relevant to the topic of this abstract, namely \\"The origin and migration patterns of Merkel cells in human fetal skin\\".

The Patriots countered, marching 78 yards in 14 plays to the Jacksonville 2-yard line, but the Jags defense held and the Patriots settled for a 20-yard field goal, increasing their lead to 13-3.

Again, on the very next play, Brady was intercepted by Davon House who returned the ball 82 yards to the Patriots 26, however, the Jags were called for pass interference again, moving the ball to the 1-yard line. On the very next play, LeGarrette Blount ran it in for a touchdown and a 30-3 Patriots lead. The Jaguars finally struck for a touchdown on their next drive as Blake Bortles hit Allen Hurns for a 59-yard touchdown pass to end the 80-yard drive. The Patriots were relentless, though. Following Jacksonville's touchdown, the Patriots matched with one of their own. Midway through the 7 play, 80-yard drive, a horse-collar tackle at the end of a 17-yard Blount run moved the ball to the Jaguars 15. Two plays later Brady hit rookie receiver Keshawn Martin on a 13-yard touchdown pass, increasing the lead to 37-10.  After forcing the Jaguars into a turnover on downs, the Patriots didn't skip a beat marching 24 yards, needing only 5 plays, with Blount rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter making the score an embarrassing 44-10.

In a strong, apparently unscripted move on his recent visit to Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, on Sunday the pontiff suddenly waved to the driver of his Popemobile, asking to get out. Surrounded by guards and by children waving Palestinian flags, he got out, walked over to the wall that separates Israel from its Palestinian neighbors, and he did something remarkably simple but with astonishing power: He prayed. This symbolic gesture occurred at a well-known portion of the wall, a segment covered with graffiti. Somebody had spray-painted a message in black: \\"Pope we need some 1 to speak about justice Bethlehem look like Warsaw ghetto.\\" In bold red letters the Pope could read: \\"Free Palestine.\\" While Israeli guards looked anxiously down from a nearby tower, wondering what on Earth was going on, Francis touched the wall with his right hand, bent his head, and prayed for several minutes. Afterward, he kissed the wall, then walked slowly back to his vehicle.\\n\\n- \\nJay Parini: On Bethlehem trip, Pope makes significant gesture by praying at separation wall\\n\\n- \\nHe says Bethlehem hugely powerful for Christians, a place of pilgrimage for Palestinians\\n\\n- \\nBethlehem a long disputed site among Palestinians, Israel.

This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]","target":"High lake","rationale":"High lake had more dense layers of water because the mixing of fresh and saltwater created a lot of stratified layers.
