At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began to work as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong Competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody.\\nMary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something.

Most matter consists of mixtures of pure substances, which can behomogeneous (uniform in composition) or heterogeneous (different regions possess different compositions and properties). Pure substances can be either chemical compounds or elements. Compounds can be broken down into elements by chemical reactions, but elements cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. The properties of substances can be classified as either physical or chemical. Scientists can observe physical properties without changing the composition of the substance, whereas chemical propertiesdescribe the tendency of a substance to undergo chemical changes (chemical reactions) that change its chemical composition. Physical properties can be intensive or extensive. Intensive properties are the same for all samples; do not depend on sample size; and include, for example, color, physical state, and melting and boiling points. Extensive properties depend on the amount of material and include mass and volume.

Fourteen patients had ipsilateral TIAs, four occurred postoperatively and 10 occurred from 1 to 8 years later. Ten patients had contralateral TIAs and five patients then had a contralateral carotid endarterectomy. Another nine patients also had bilateral operations, three for bilateral TIAs, five as prophylactic procedures on the basis of arteriographic findings, and one for a contralateral cerebral event that occurred after arteriography. Thus, at the mean follow-up time (5.5 years) and including the operative complications, four deaths (4%) of cerebral origin and seven serious cerebral problems (7%) have occurred--an annual morbidity and mortality rate of less than 2%.

Because of the money, visibility, and chance to do his own television special, Kaufman acts on Taxi, but secretly hates it and works a second menial job as a restaurant busboy. Around this time, he gains popularity by making successful guest appearances on the new show 'Saturday Night Live'.At a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer named Tony Clifton, whom Andy wants to guest-star several times on Taxi on his terms, and whose bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. When Clifton meets Shapiro privately, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and we see that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a villain character created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti), both of whom...","target":"What character do audiences demand he performs?","rationale":"The movie plot is about the life of Andy Kaufman, a comedian who was famous for his acts like foreign man and impersonating Elvis Presley.

Glial and neuronal nuclear populations were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain except the cerebellum, followed by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in 2.4 and 2.2 M sucrose. For purposes of comparison, liver nuclei were prepared by centrifugation in 2.4 M sucrose. Microscopic examination of the nuclei confirmed the purity of the two nuclear fractions to be above 90% with minimal extranuclear contamination. T3 binding studies were performed on the washed nuclear fractions using saturation analysis techniques. Maximum binding (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. After 30 min incubation at 37 C, Bmax in neuronal nuclei was 1203 +/- 118 fmol/mg DNA (mean +/- SE) (n = 6), in comparison with 196 +/- 14 fmol/mg DNA in glial nuclei (n = 7). The corrected value for Bmax in glial nuclei, assuming 8% neuronal nuclear contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was 299 +/- 38 fmol/mg DNA (n = 6). The Kd values were 0.38 +/- 0.04 nM, 0.34 +/- 0.05 nM, and 0.33 +/- 0.04 nM in neuronal, glial, and liver nuclei, respectively. The specificity of T3 binding to the nuclear receptor in both neuronal and glial nuclei was studied in competition studies, and revealed closely similar relative binding affinities (T3 greater than T4 greater than rT3) in both. We conclude that the higher T3 binding capacity of neuronal nuclei may be related to their higher protein synthetic ability, suggesting that T3 may be of importance in a rapid structural turnover in these cells. The effect of T3 on myelination in glial cells may be mediated through the nucleus.","target":"Triiodothyronine binding in adult rat brain: compartmentation of receptor populations in purified neuronal and glial nuclei","rationale":"A good title for this paper should provide information about the focus of the research, such as T3 binding in adult rat brain and a novel technique used to separate nuclei from neuronal and glial cells.

This event has later received considerable attention from Swedish historians and is known as midsommarkrisen, the Midsummer Crisis.  Confirmation of the King's action is contained in German Foreign Policy documents captured at the end of the war. On 25 June 1941, the German Minister in Stockholm sent a \\"Most Urgent-Top Secret\\" message to Berlin in which he stated that the King had just informed him that the transit of German troops would be allowed. He added:  The King's words conveyed the joyful emotion he felt. He had lived through anxious days and had gone far in giving his personal support to the matter. He added confidentially that he had found it necessary to go so far as to mention his abdication.  According to Ernst Wigforss, both Gustaf V and Prince Gustav Adolf attempted to persuade the Swedish Government to allow the Allies to transport troops through Sweden, though this was rejected by the Government because it was felt it would cause retributions from Germany.\\n\\nwere they successful","target":"this was rejected by the Government because it was felt it would cause retributions from Germany.","rationale":"According to Ernst Wigforss, both Gustaf V and Prince Gustav Adolf attempted to persuade the Swedish Government to allow the Allies to transport troops through Sweden.

In fact, I write about both regularly.

Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness.\\nIt takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety.\\nDon’t stuff your emotions!\\nLet yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress.

A defect in BLM activity results in the cancer-predisposing Bloom syndrome (BS). Here, we report that BLM-deficient cell lines and primary fibroblasts display an endogenously activated DNA double-strand break checkpoint response with prominent levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX), Chk2 (p(T68)Chk2), and ATM (p(S1981)ATM) colocalizing in nuclear foci. Interestingly, the mitotic fraction of gamma-H2AX foci did not seem to be higher in BLM-deficient cells, indicating that these lesions form transiently during interphase. Pulse labeling with iododeoxyuridine and immunofluorescence microscopy showed the colocalization of gamma-H2AX, ATM, and Chk2 together with replication foci. Those foci costained for Rad51, indicating homologous recombination at these replication sites. We therefore analyzed replication in BS cells using a single molecule approach on combed DNA fibers. In addition to a higher frequency of replication fork barriers, BS cells displayed a reduced average fork velocity and global reduction of interorigin distances indicative of an elevated frequency of origin firing. Because BS is one of the most penetrant cancer-predisposing hereditary diseases, it is likely that the lack of BLM engages the cells in a situation similar to precancerous tissues with replication stress. To our knowledge, this is the first report of high ATM-Chk2 kinase activation and its linkage to replication defects in a BS model..

In 1514, Sultan Selim I, nicknamed \\"the Grim\\" because of his cruelty, ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Alevis (Qizilbash), whom he considered heretics, reportedly proclaiming that \\"the killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\\"[page needed] Selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East, especially through his conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, which included much of the region. With these conquests, Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic caliphate, although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with Murad I (reigned 1362 to 1389). The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Alevis","rationale":"The question asks which Muslim sect beginning with \\"Ale\\" were regarded even worse than Jews and Christians.

I actually think I am pretty humble about it and am actually making a name for myself through basketball. But anyway my families been campaigning pretty hard to get my dad back in office and, one day, my family holds a raffle for an event, and that morning my mom wakes me up and tells me to wake my girlfriend up to sign a couple raffles on her way out the door. Me being super groggy, thinks why wake my girlfriend? I'll just quickly sign this with MY name and crash back out instead of waking her up. And what do you know, I win the Grand Prize of a signed guitar by my dad lol! It's funny and badass that it's signed by my dad, but my older brother who's actually been working pretty hard on the campaign aswell, texts me saying everyone agrees he should keep it because he's been one of the hardest workers, and I'm thinking 'Fuck that, if they thought that, why don't they just pitch in and grab him one?' And also, i was a little pissed they just gave it away right off the bat without saying anything to me. So they get back, and we're all checkin it out, and I just straight up say it, 'it's my guitar, I won it man.', and he goes 'we already agreed dude' and 'it's not even supposed to be yours, mom said tell *girlfriend* to sign it. It doesn't look good having his son participate in the family raffle, it's for the people.' I understood that last part, but completely spaced it out when I was filling them out that morning. But to be fair, I won it under MY name. He gives it to me kinda pissed. Then I tell my girlfriend, now she says it should be hers and she can give it to her brother who plays guitar. But then again, it was won under MY name. I was just as hopeful as any other raffle and genuinely felt pretty ecstatic to win the GRAND PRIZE. I definitely wasn't gonna give it up that easy.

He has written extensively about the relationship between language, literature and society, and the impact of the Holocaust. An article in The Guardian described Steiner as a \\"polyglot and polymath\\", saying that he is either \\"often credited with recasting the role of the critic\\", or a \\"pretentious namedropper\\" whose \\"range comes at the price of inaccuracy\\" and \\"complacency\\". Among his admirers, Steiner is ranked \\"among the great minds in today's literary world.\\"\\n\\nIn 1956 Steiner returned to the United States, where for two years he was a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He also held a Fulbright professorship in Innsbruck, Austria from 1958 to 1959. In 1959, he was appointed Gauss Lecturer at Princeton, where he lectured for another two years. He then became a founding fellow of Churchill College at the University of Cambridge in 1961. Steiner was initially not well received at Cambridge by the English faculty. Many disapproved of this charismatic \\"firebrand with a foreign accent\\" and questioned the relevance of the Holocaust he constantly referred to in his lectures. Bryan Cheyette, professor of 20th-century literature at the University of Southampton said that at the time, \\"Britain [...] didn't think it had a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz, Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain.\\" While Steiner received a professorial salary, he was never made a full professor at Cambridge with the right to examine. He had the option of leaving for professorships in the United States, but Steiner's father objected, saying that Hitler, who said no one bearing their name would be left in Europe, would then have won. Steiner remained in England because \\"I'd do anything rather than face such contempt from my father.\\" He was elected an Extraordinary Fellow at Cambridge in 1969.  After several years as a freelance writer and occasional lecturer, Steiner accepted the post of Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva in 1974; he held this post for 20 years, teaching in four languages. He lived by Goethe's maxim that \\"no monoglot truly knows his own language.\\" He became Professor Emeritus at Geneva University on his retirement in 1994, and an Honorary Fellow at Balliol College at Oxford University in 1995. He has since held the positions of the first Lord Weidenfeld Professor of Comparative European Literature and Fellow of St Anne's College at Oxford University from 1994 to 1995, and Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University from 2001 to 2002.  Steiner has been called \\"an intelligent and intellectual critic and essayist.\\" He was active on undergraduate publications while at the University of Chicago and later become a regular contributor of reviews and articles to many journals and newspapers including the Times Literary Supplement and The Guardian. He has written for The New Yorker for over thirty years, contributing over two hundred reviews.

He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River.

It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes, (the coding regions), the noncoding DNA and the genomes of the mitochondria and chloroplasts.\\n\\n- Chloroplasts are organelles, specialized subunits, in plant and algal cells. Their discovery inside plant cells is usually credited to Julius von Sachs (18321897), an influential botanist and author of standard botanical textbooks  sometimes called \\"The Father of Plant Physiology\\".\\n\\n- The \\"Proteobacteria\\" are a major phylum of Gram-negative bacteria. The name of the phylum has never been validly published as no type genus has been proposed, thus it must be styled in quotation marks as the name has no standing in nomenclature. They include a wide variety of pathogens, such as \\"Escherichia\\", \\"Salmonella\\", \\"Vibrio\\", \\"Helicobacter\\", \\"Yersinia\\", and many other notable genera.\\nOthers are free-living (nonparasitic), and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation.\\n\\n- Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.\\n\\n- A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in living organisms. It is generally considered a field of biology, but intersects frequently with many other life sciences and is strongly linked with the study of information systems.\\n\\n- Molecular biology concerns the molecular basis of biological activity between biomolecules in the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins and their biosynthesis, as well as the regulation of these interactions. Writing in \\"Nature\\" in 1961, William Astbury described molecular biology as:\\n\\n- Nucleotides are organic molecules that serve as the monomers, or subunits, of nucleic acids like DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). The building blocks of nucleic acids, nucleotides are composed of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and at least one phosphate group. A nucleoside is a nitrogenuous base and a 5-carbon sugar. Thus a nucleoside plus a phosphate group yields a nucleotide. Nucleotides are also known as phosphate nucleotides.\\n\\n- The coding region of a gene, also known as the coding sequence or CDS (from coding DNA sequence), is that portion of a gene's DNA or RNA, composed of exons, that codes for protein. The region is bounded nearer the 5' end by a start codon and nearer the 3' end with a stop codon. The coding region in mRNA is bounded by the five prime untranslated region (5'-UTR) and the three prime untranslated region (3'-UTR), which are also parts of the exons. The CDS is that portion of an mRNA transcript that is translated by a ribosome.\\n\\n- Agar (pronounced ) or agar-agar is a jelly-like substance, obtained from algae. It was discovered in the late 1650s or early 1660s by Mino Tarzaemon in Japan, where it is called \\"kanten\\".\\n\\n- In genomics and related disciplines, noncoding DNA sequences are components of an organism's DNA that do not encode protein sequences. Some noncoding DNA is transcribed into functional non-coding RNA molecules (e.g. transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and regulatory RNAs). Other functions of noncoding DNA include the transcriptional and translational regulation of protein-coding sequences, scaffold attachment regions, origins of DNA replication, centromeres and telomeres.\\n\\n- Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.\\n\\n- A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.\\n\\n- Sorangium cellulosum is a soil - dwelling Gram - negative bacterium of the group myxobacteria . It is motile and shows gliding motility . Under stressful conditions this motility , as in other myxobacteria , the cells congregate to form fruiting bodies and differentiate into myxospores . These congregating cells make isolation of pure culture and colony counts on agar medium difficult as the bacterium spread and colonies merge . It has an unusually - large genome of 13,033,779 base pairs , making it the largest bacterial genome sequenced to date by roughly 4 Mb.\\n\\n- Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.\\n\\n- An RNA virus is a virus that has RNA (ribonucleic acid) as its genetic material. This nucleic acid is usually single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) but may be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Notable human diseases caused by RNA viruses include Ebola hemorrhoragic fever, SARS, the common cold, influenza, hepatitis C, West Nile fever, polio and measles.\\n\\n- The myxobacteria (\\"slime bacteria\\") are a group of bacteria that predominantly live in the soil and feed on insoluble organic substances.

E-cadherin stability depends on F-actin, but the mechanisms regulating actin polymerization at cell-cell junctions remain poorly understood. Here we investigated a role for formin-mediated actin polymerization at cell-cell junctions. We identify mDia1 and Fmnl3 as major factors enhancing actin polymerization and stabilizing E-cadherin at epithelial junctions. Fmnl3 localizes to adherens junctions downstream of Src and Cdc42 and its depletion leads to a reduction in F-actin and E-cadherin at junctions and a weakening of cell-cell adhesion. Of importance, Fmnl3 expression is up-regulated and junctional localization increases during collective cell migration. Depletion of Fmnl3 or mDia1 in migrating monolayers results in dissociation of leader cells and impaired wound repair. In summary, our results show that formin activity at epithelial cell-cell junctions is important for adhesion and the maintenance of epithelial cohesion during dynamic processes, such as wound repair.","target":"False","rationale":"There is no topic sentence that clearly states the main idea of the abstract.

At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

In the current study, we evaluated such genes after applying spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy.', 'Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6 per group) were randomized into test and control groups. The spared nerve injury model was used to simulate a neuropathic pain state. A 4-contact microelectrode was implanted at the L1 vertebral level and SCS was applied continuously for 72 hours.

Warbeck had seen the potential of the Cornish unrest in the 1st Cornish Rebellion of 1497 even though the Cornish had been defeated at the Battle of Blackheath on 17 June 1497. Warbeck proclaimed that he would put a stop to extortionate taxes levied to help fight a war against Scotland and was warmly welcomed in Cornwall. His wife, Lady Catharine, was left in the safety of St Michael's Mount and when he decided to attack Exeter his supporters declared him ‘Richard IV' on Bodmin Moor. Most of the Cornish gentry supported Warbeck's cause after their setback previously in June of that year and on 17 September a Cornish army some 6,000 strong entered Exeter, where the walls were badly damaged, before advancing on Taunton. Henry VII sent his chief general, Giles, Lord Daubeney, to attack the Cornish and when Warbeck heard that the King's scouts were at Glastonbury he panicked and deserted his army. Warbeck was captured at Beaulieu Abbey in Hampshire, where he surrendered. Henry VII reached Taunton on 4 October 1497, where he received the surrender of the remaining Cornish army. The ringleaders were executed and others fined an enormous total of £13,000. 'King Richard' was imprisoned, first, at Taunton, then in London, where he was ‘paraded through the streets on horseback amid much hooting and derision of the citizens'.

It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for pendant jewelry.\\n\\n- Sonata (Italian: , pl. \\"sonate\\"; from Latin and Italian: \\"sonare\\", \\"to sound\\"), in music, literally means a piece \\"played\\" as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\"), a piece \\"sung\\". The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and is vague. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regardedalongside the fugueas one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure.\\n\\n- DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system.\\n\\n- DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS.\\n\\n- The game was highly popular for Namco upon its release, and has been a focus of competitive gaming ever since. It spawned a successful sequel, \\"Galaga\\", in 1981, and the lesser known \\"Gaplus\\" and \\"Galaga '88\\" in 1984 and 1987 respectively, as well as many later ports and adaptations. Along with its immediate sequel, it was one of the most popular games during the golden age of arcade video games.\\n\\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\\n\\n- A trilogy (from Greek - \\"\\", \\"three\\" and - \\"-logia\\", \\"discourse\\") is a set of three works of art that are connected, and that can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works. They are commonly found in literature, film, or video games. Three-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, such as the triptych or the three-movement sonata, but they are not commonly referred to with the term \\"trilogy.\\"\\n\\n- Namco was a front-runner during the golden age of arcade video games. \\"Pac-Man\\" went on to become the best-selling arcade game in history and an international popular culture icon. Namco was also known for creating successful franchises such as \\"Galaxian\\", \\"Ridge Racer\\", \\"Ace Combat\\", \\"Tekken\\", as well as the \\"Soul\\" and \\"Tales\\" series.\\n\\n- x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.\\n\\n- \\"Galaga\\" is one of the most commercially and critically successful games from the golden age of arcade video games. The arcade version of it has been ported to many consoles, and it has had several sequels. In 2011, the game celebrated its 30th anniversary with the release of \\"Galaga 30th Collection\\" for iOS.\\n\\n- MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.\\n\\n- Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\\n\\n- The golden age of arcade video games was the era of greatest popularity and technological innovation for arcade video games. The exact time period is a matter of debate, but key moments include the release of \\"Space Invaders\\" in 1978 and the introduction of vector display technology in 1979. The golden age lasted until the late 1980s, when home video game consoles like the NES were introduced.\\n\\n- Kiloblaster is a space shooter video game trilogy written by Allen Pilgrim and published by Epic MegaGames in 1992 . It is based on the classic Galaxian game , with a few differences such as allowing greater player movement ( up and down as well as left and right ) , much faster enemy movement , power - ups , enemies that take more than one hit , and allies to assist in battle . It runs under MS - DOS , and took advantage of the still relatively new 256 - colour VGA standard , although like Jill of the Jungle before it , a 16 - colour EGA mode was also selectable in version 1.0 . Running in 256 - colour mode would place many obviously computer - generated backgrounds behind the main game levels , something common in games of this era keen to show off their graphical capabilities . The game also has Adlib music ( in CMF format ) and Sound Blaster sound effects . Allen Pilgrim declared the registered version freeware and released also the source code on August 4 , 2008 .\\n\\n- There are few known ports of this game. It appears on some multi-game cartridges, which were released long after its arcade release. It was ported to the Sony PlayStation in 1996 as one of the games featured in \\"Namco Museum Volume 2\\", using its original name, \\"Gaplus\\". It was also released on mobile phones with its \\"Galaga 3\\" title, and is also part of the \\"Namco Museum Remix\\" (2007) and \\"Namco Museum Megamix\\" (2010) for the Wii with its original title being used. The original version was later re-released under its original name for the Wii Virtual Console Arcade on March 25, 2009 in North America, at a cost of 600 Wii Points (500 Wii Points in Europe and Australia).\\n\\n- The backgrounds for Stages 1517 (the fourth block of stages) consist of the green hexagonal space stations first seen in the 1981 Namco game \\"Bosconian\\".

He has written or produced numerous worldwide hits including 18 No. 1 records in America and the UK, and over a hundred top-40 hits. Stock is one of the most successful songwriters of all time as recognised by the Guinness Book of Records. As part of Stock Aitken and Waterman, he is acknowledged as the most successful producer-songwriter in British chart history and holds the record for the most No. 1 records with different acts, with 11.\\n\\nIn 1993 Stock formed 'Love This Records', and built a brand new multimillion-pound recording studio in London. The first record released with 'Love This Records' was a dance cover of the track Total Eclipse of the Heart. It was a worldwide hit for Nicki French, reaching No. 2 in America and No. 1 in seven countries selling over 2 million copies. In 1994 Simon Cowell asked Stock to produce the record for the popular kid's TV show 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' which was a top 5 hit in the UK. Cowell had worked with Stock on previous occasions with artists such as Sinitta, for whom Stock wrote and produced various hits like Toy Boy in 1987. Stock again collaborated with Cowell in 1993 on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) album Wrestlemania which spawned the No. 4 hit 'Slam Jam'.  In 1994 Stock produced several artists for Simon Cowell including Kym Mazelle, Jocelyn Brown and Robson and Jerome. Their cover of Unchained Melody produced by Stock and Aitken became the highest selling non-charity single of the decade, remaining at No. 1 for 7 weeks in 1995 selling 2.5 million copies. Stock produced a further two No. 1 singles with Robson and Jerome and two No. 1 albums.  After several years producing hits for Stock's own label 'Love This Records' and with Simon Cowell for BMG/RCA, the structural integrity of Stock's studio became compromised by the tunnelling of the Jubilee Line extension, and the damage forced Stock to pursue legal action against London Underground. As a result, Stock was forced to pull out of a joint deal with Cowell and BMG to produce several artists including the band Westlife in 1996.  In 1998 Stock and Aitken teamed up with Steve Crosby who had created the group Steps, to form the band Scooch. Their first single 'When My Baby' reached No. 29 and their follow up, 'More Than I Needed To Know', was a top 5 hit in the UK in 2000 and went to No. 1 in Japan. Scooch's album 'Four Sure' spawned two more top 20 singles. Stock also scored a top 20 with 'Airhead' by girl band Girls@Play, with EastEnders' star Rita Simons that toured with Steps. In 2003 Stock formed the label Better the Devil Records and had a huge hit with the Fast Food Song selling 200,000 CD singles. Stock wrote and produced two further singles for the Fast Food Rockers including the top 10 'Smile Please'.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What is an album that he recorded there?","target":"The first record released with 'Love This Records' was a dance cover of the track Total Eclipse of the Heart.","rationale":"The question asks for an album that was recorded in the recording studio built by Michael Stock.

One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\\n\\n- The Fourth Crusade (120204) was a Western European armed expedition called by Pope Innocent III, originally intended to conquer Muslim-controlled Jerusalem by means of an invasion through Egypt.

France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.\\n\\n- Out of the Inkwell was a major animated series of the silent era produced by Max Fleischer from 1918 to 1929.\\nThe series was the result of three short experimental films that Max Fleischer independently produced in the period of 19141916 to demonstrate his invention, the Rotoscope, which was a device consisting of a film projector and easel used as an aid for achieving realistic movement for animated cartoons. The Rotoscope would project motion picture film through an opening in the easel, covered by a glass pane serving as a drawing surface. The image on the projected film was traced onto paper, advancing the film one frame at a time as each drawing would be made.

Once published news and information in books is in the public domain, although they may also be copyrighted. In the sense of intellectual property, works in the public domain are those whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable. For example, the works of Shakespeare and Beethoven, and most of the early silent films, are all now in the public domain by either being created before copyrights existed or leaving the copyright term. Examples for works not covered by copyright which are therefore in the public domain, are the formulae of Newtonian physics, cooking recipes and all software before 1974. Examples for works actively dedicated into public domain by their authors are reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms, NIH's ImageJ, and the CIA's \\"World Factbook\\".

Changes in organelle distribution within the dendritic arbors of dynein mutant neurons correlate with a proximal shift in dendritic branch position. Dynein is also necessary for the dendrite-specific localization of Golgi outposts and the ion channel Pickpocket.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.\\n\\n- Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

Its area is 1,140 km² and its greatest depth is 64 m. Mälaren spans 120 kilometers from east to west. The lake drains, from south-west to north-east, into the Baltic Sea through the Södertälje Canal, Hammarbyslussen, Karl Johansslussen and Norrström. The easternmost bay of Mälaren, in central Stockholm, is called Riddarfjärden. The lake is located in Svealand and bounded by the provinces of Uppland, Södermanland, Närke, and Västmanland. The two largest islands in Mälaren are Selaön (91 km²) and Svartsjölandet (79 km²).\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a collection of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The original manuscript of the \\"Chronicle\\" was created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. In one case, the \\"Chronicle\\" was still being actively updated in 1154.\\n\\n- Eric the Victorious (Old Norse: \\"Eiríkr inn sigrsæli\\", Modern Swedish: \\"Erik Segersäll\\") (c. 945?  c. 995) was the first Swedish king (c. 970995) about whom anything definite is known. Whether he actually qualifies as King of Sweden has been debated, as his son Olof Skötkonung was the first ruler documented to have been accepted both by the Svear around Lake Mälaren and by the Götar around Lake Vättern.\\n\\n- The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.\\n\\n- Stade is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany and part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region (\\"Metropolregion Hamburg\\"). It is the seat of the district named after it. The city was first mentioned in a document from 994.\\n\\n- King Cnut the Great (Old Norse: \\"Knútr inn ríki\\"; c. 995  12 November 1035), also known as Canute, was King of Denmark, England, and Norway, together often referred to as the Anglo-Scandinavian or North Sea Empire. After his death, the deaths of his heirs within a decade, and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, his legacy was mostly forgotten. The medieval historian Norman Cantor stated that he was \\"the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history\\", although Cnut himself was Danish and not a Briton or Anglo-Saxon.\\n\\n- witosawa was a Polish princess, daughter of Mieszko I of Poland and Dobrawa of Bohemia, and sister of Boleslaw I of Poland. She was married first to Eric the Victorious of Sweden and then Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, according to German chroniclers, and gave them the sons Olof, and Canute and Harald, respectively. The name is only known through an inscription that gives the name of Canute's sister and the assumption that this sister was named for her mother.\\n\\n- Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper.\\n\\n- Adam of Bremen (also: Adamus Bremensis) was a German medieval chronicler. He lived and worked in the second half of the eleventh century. He is most famous for his chronicle \\"Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum\\" (\\"Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church\\").\\n\\n- Harald \\"Blåtand\\" Gormsson (probably born c. 935) was a king of Denmark and Norway.\\n\\n- Mieszko I (ca. 930  25 May 992) was the ruler of the Polans from about 960 until his death. A member of the Piast dynasty, he was a son of Siemomys, and a grandchild of Lestek. He was the father of Bolesaw I the Brave (the first crowned king of Poland) and Gunhild of Wenden with his wife Oda. Most sources make Mieszko I the father of Sigrid the Haughty, a Nordic Queen, though one source identifies her father as Skoglar Toste, and the grandfather of Cnut the Great (Gundhild's son), and the great-grandfather of Gunhilda of Denmark, Canute the Great's daughter and wife of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor.\\n\\n- Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse: \\"Sveinn Tjúguskegg\\"; Danish: \\"Svend Tveskæg\\"; 960  3 February 1014) was king of Denmark, England, and parts of Norway. His name appears as Swegen in the \\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\". He was the son of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, and the father of Cnut the Great.\\n\\n- Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe.\\n\\n- Gunhilda of Wenden was a semi-legendary Polish or other Slavic princess and Danish Viking age queen consort, the supposed spouse of 10th-century King Sweyn I of Denmark (9861014).\\n\\n- Sigrid the Haughty , also known as Sigríð Storråda , is a queen appearing in Norse sagas as wife , first of Eric the Victorious of Sweden , then Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark . Sigrid appears in many sagas composed generations after the events they describe , but there is no reliable evidence as to her existence as they describe her . The figure of Sigrid appears mainly in late Icelandic sagas , while more contemporary sources such as Thietmar of Merseburg and Adam of Bremen instead claim that Sweyn was married to a Polish princess , identified as witosawa . Snorri Sturlason gives conflicting information and in one place says that Sweyn was married to Sigrid and in another that he was married to a Gunhild of Wenden . It is unclear if the figure of Sigrid was a real person , if the saga account of her is an amalgamation of the lives and deeds of several women , or if she is a completely fictional character . The latter view is held by some modern scholars such as Birgitta Fritz , who does not give much credibility to the Nordic sources , and thus considers Sigrid a mere myth .\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'sigrid the haughty' with the relationship of 'date of death'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1\\n - 10\\n - 100\\n - 1014\\n - 1022\\n - 1035\\n - 1154\\n - 12\\n - 120\\n - 1262\\n - 1468\\n - 16\\n - 1814\\n - 188\\n - 2\\n - 2016\\n - 25\\n - 25 may 992\\n - 267\\n - 284\\n - 39\\n - 443\\n - 466\\n - 49\\n - 64\\n - 7\\n - 82\\n - 930\\n - 935\\n - 945\\n - 960\\n - 970\\n - 975\\n - 980\\n - 986\\n - 994\\n - 995","target":"1014","rationale":"Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse: \\"Sveinn Tjúguskegg\\"; Danish: \\"Svend Tveskæg\\") was king of Denmark, England, and parts of Norway.

While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died. The new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.

But according to a psychology study by Dr. Richard Wiseman, there's one thing that'll greatly increase your odds of being reunited with a lost wallet: a photograph of a cute baby.\\nIn the study, hundreds of wallets were scattered  around the streets of Edinburgh, Scotland. The psychologists wanted to see how many strangers would take the trouble to return them to the addresses listed on the drivers' licenses inside--but more than that, they wanted to find out what would make a person more likely to help out a stranger.\\nTo finish this, they included personal things in most of the wallets: some included a photo of a happy elderly couple, some contained a cute puppy, some contained a family portrait, and some held a photo of a lovely baby. Others had receipts  showing that the wallet's owner had recently donated to a charity . Some contained no personal details.\\nAs the psychologists soon discovered, the sight of a smiling baby is enough to warm nearly any heart: only one in ten of the strangers who _ such wallets did not return them. In contrast, the second most successful image, the puppy, had a 53% return rate. When the wallet included no photograph, it stood only a one in seven chance of being returned to the owner.\\nThe success of the baby photograph shows a human compassion  for the young that's been passed down through the ages, according to Dr. Wiseman. \\"The baby kicked off a caring feeling in people, which is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective ,\\" he told theTimes.\\nTo ensure our species' survival, scientists think that we must feel empathy and compassion for our young.

At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios,  in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him \\"just a little wear on [his] tape heads\\". While completing the early recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments, except drums, himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989). The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.Reznor coined the name \\"Nine Inch Nails\\" because it \\"abbreviated easily\\", rather than for \\"any literal meaning\\".

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.","target":"Johnston","rationale":"The article mentions the name of a person, who is auditioned by the choirmaster.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.","target":"Dan","rationale":"The passage states that the two students learned about petroleum products.

Passage 1:Bullock served as the 46th Governor of Georgia from 1868 to 1871 during Reconstruction and was the first Republican governor of Georgia. After Georgia ratified the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Omnibus Act declared that states were entitled to representation in Congress as one of the states of the Union. Georgia again lost the right to representation in Congress because the General Assembly expelled twenty-eight black members and prevented blacks from voting in the 1868 presidential election (see Original 33). In response to an appeal from Bullock, Georgia was again placed under military rule as part of the Georgia Act of December 22, 1869. This made Bullock a hated political figure. After various allegations of scandal and ridicule, in 1871 he was obliged by the Ku Klux Klan to resign the governorship, and felt it prudent to leave the state. He was succeeded by Republican State Senate president Benjamin Conley, who served as Governor for the two remaining months of the term to which Bullock had been elected. Conley was succeeded by James M. Smith, a Democrat, and no Republican would serve as governor of Georgia again until Sonny Perdue in 2003.\\n Passage 2:While the first game imitated popular Spaghetti Western film soundtracks, the second game aimed to become more unique. Jackson estimated that he changed the music about four times throughout development, from extreme experimentation to classic Western sounds, ultimately blending to make \\"something different\\". Pavlovich felt that in order to find an effective result, they had to \\"push it almost until you break it, and then you swing back\\". To avoid imitating the bell used in Spaghetti Western soundtracks, Jackson instead used a mandolin used by the Wrecking Crew. The music team found reference points in Willie Nelson's album Teatro (1998) and the soundtrack for the 1971 film The Hired Hand. Session guitarist Matt Sweeney took inspiration from segments of other music—such as the insistent drums in the work of Ennio Morricone—without being derivative. While researching for the game's score, Jackson found that Morricone's work—particularly on Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy—was already a departure from typical Western music of the time, instead featuring sounds popular at the time such as \\"psychedelic guitars, lots of noises\\", so Jackson felt that he could also take such creative liberties with Red Dead Redemption 2. Similarly, he was even more influenced by Masaru Sato's score on Akira Kurosawa's film Yojimbo (1961), which he felt focused on emotion rather than trying to replicate the sound of feudal Japan, the film's setting.\\n Passage 3:Christ Church was built between 1855 and 1857 to a design by the London architect Henry Martin. It was built as a chapel for Lancaster Grammar School and the local workhouse. The church was paid for and endowed by Samuel Gregson, a local industrialist and MP. In 1889 a south aisle was added, designed by the local architects Paley and Austin. It provided 152 seats, and cost about £1,000. In 1894–95 a west baptistry was added by the same practice, then known as Paley, Austin and Paley. The same practice (by now Austin and Paley) converted the organ chamber into the Storey chapel, the organ having been moved into the south transept. In 1919 a war memorial was installed in the churchyard. It was in Derbyshire stone, high, and cost £400.

So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \\"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding?

Scientists discovered a skin-lighting mutation that partially accounts for the appearance of Light skin in humans (people who migrated out of Africa northward into what is now Europe) which they estimate occurred 20,000 to 50,000 years ago.

You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Tom and Jacob are carrying Geiger counters through an old abandoned city near a nuclear plant. Tom walks into a hotel and looks around at all the paintings and old couches in the lobby. His Geiger counter remains silent, but as he walks up the stairs toward the second floor it starts to slowly but steadily make more sound.

Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history. His tally sees him surpass the previous record of 210 set by the prolific Swedish striker Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan in the 1950s. \\"It's what I've always wanted, to wear this shirt and beat one record after another,\\" said Totti, AFP reported. \\"I've overtaken Nordahl and I'm proud of that. Now I'm aiming for Altafini,\\" he added, AFP reported. Brazilian Jose Altafini is the joint third highest scorer (along with Giuseppe Meazza) in Serie A history with 216 goals. Totti's early brace and a goal from Fabio Borini put Roma 3-0 up with only eight minutes played. Juan and Miralem Pjanic added further goals in the second half after CM Eder had pulled a goal back for Cesena on the hour mark. The win lifts Roma to sixth -- although Napoli will overtake them again if they win at Siena on Sunday -- and boosts their chances of qualifying for European football next season. Cesena, however, remain mired in trouble hovering just above the foot of the table in 18th place with 15 points. \\nQuestion: How many goals has Francesco Totti made for Roma as of Saturday? \\nIs it 210?","target":"No","rationale":"The context says that Francesco Totti set a new Serie A scoring record on Saturday as his side demolished Cesena 5-1.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles.\\nIt is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.\\nTeasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates.

It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.\\n\\n- West Bend is the county seat of Washington County, Wisconsin, United States, in southeastern Wisconsin.

The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.\\n\\n- A bulletin board system, or BBS, is a computer server running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web, social networks and other aspects of the Internet. Low-cost, high-performance modems drove the use of online services and BBSes through the early 1990s. \\"Infoworld\\" estimated there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services like CompuServe.\\n\\n\\n\\n'xmodem' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- airport\\n - base\\n - bulletin board system\\n - channel\\n - city\\n - collective\\n - communication\\n - communications protocol\\n - computer\\n - computer file\\n - country\\n - county\\n - county seat\\n - data\\n - device\\n - exchange\\n - factory\\n - february\\n - file\\n - four\\n - history\\n - information\\n - market\\n - message\\n - number\\n - ocean\\n - pen\\n - performance\\n - population\\n - river\\n - running\\n - seat\\n - set\\n - software\\n - state\\n - technology\\n - timeline\\n - tribe\\n - user\\n - variety\\n - ward","target":"communications protocol","rationale":"The question is asking what type of object entity \\"xmodem\\" is related to through the relation, instance of.

Almost two weeks later, on July 23, at 3:00 p.m. EDT, it relayed the first publicly available live transatlantic television signal. The broadcast was shown in Europe by Eurovision and in North America by NBC, CBS, ABC, and the CBC. The first public broadcast featured CBS's Walter Cronkite and NBC's Chet Huntley in New York, and the BBC's Richard Dimbleby in Brussels. The first pictures were the Statue of Liberty in New York and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The first broadcast was to have been remarks by President John F. Kennedy, but the signal was acquired before the president was ready, so engineers filled the lead-in time with a short segment of a televised game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. The batter, Tony Taylor, was seen hitting a ball pitched by Cal Koonce to the right fielder George Altman. From there, the video switched first to Washington, DC; then to Cape Canaveral, Florida; to the Seattle World's Fair; then to Quebec and finally to Stratford, Ontario.

However, during 1966 Red Guards led a crowd to break statues, burn scriptures and open the stupas containing the relics of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas, and throw them in the river.

Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\\n\\n- Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a Gram - positive , non-motile bacterium that plays an important role in the creation of Emmental cheese , and to some extent , Jarlsberg cheese , Leerdammer and Maasdam cheese . Its concentration in Swiss - type cheeses is higher than in any other cheese . Propionibacteria are commonly found in milk and dairy products , though they have also been extracted from soil . P. freudenreichii has a circular chromosome about 2.5 Mb long . When Emmental cheese is being produced , P. freudenreichii ferments lactate to form acetate , propionate , and carbon dioxide ( 3 C3H6O3  2 C2H5CO2 + C2H3O2 + CO2 ) . The products of this fermentation contribute to the nutty and sweet flavors of the cheese , and the carbon dioxide byproduct is responsible for forming the holes , or \`\` eyes '' in the cheese . Cheesemakers control the size of the holes by changing the acidity , temperature , and curing time of the mixture . An estimated one billion living cells of P. freudenreichii are present in one gram of Emmental . In contrast to most lactic acid bacteria , this bacterium mainly breaks down lipids , forming free fatty acids . Recent research has focused on possible benefits incurred from consuming P. freudenreichii , which are thought to cleanse the gastrointestinal tract . P. freudenreichii has also been suggested to possibly lower the incidence of colon cancer . This mutualistic relationship is unusual in propionibacteria , which are largely commensal . The performance and growth of P. freudenreichii is highly dependent on the presence of Lactobacillus helveticus , which provides essential amino acids . The degradation of L. helvecticus releases a variety of amino acids and peptides . While P. freudenreichii has been found to grow even in the absence of L. helvecticus , some strains of the bacteria were observed lysing in the absence of glutamine , lysine , or tyrosine . The autolysis of P. freudenreichii has been suggested to contribute further to the flavor of the Emmental cheese .

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.\\n\\n- Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth. This naturally occurring chemical compound is made up of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, in ice caps and glaciers and also in seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas.\\n\\n- Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.\\n\\n- In chemistry, a carbonate is a salt of carbonic acid (HCO), characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion, . The name may also mean an ester of carbonic acid, an organic compound containing the carbonate group C(=O)(O).\\n\\n- Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.\\n\\n- In chemistry, esters are chemical compounds derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an Oalkyl (alkoxy) group. Usually, esters are derived from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Glycerides, which are fatty acid esters of glycerol, are important esters in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids, and making up the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in essential oils and pheromones. Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules. Nitrate esters, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties, while polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties.\\n\\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- Lactose is a disaccharide sugar composed of galactose and glucose that is found in milk. Lactose makes up around 28% of milk (by weight), although the amount varies among species and individuals, and milk with a reduced amount of lactose also exists. It is extracted from sweet or sour whey. The name comes from ' (gen. '), the Latin word for milk, plus the \\"-ose\\" ending used to name sugars. It has a formula of CHO and the hydrate formula CHO·HO, making it an isomer of sucrose.\\n\\n- An acetate is a salt formed by the combination of acetic acid with an alkaline, earthy, or metallic base. \\"Acetate\\" also describes the conjugate base or ion (specifically, the negatively charged ion called an anion) typically found in aqueous solution and written with the chemical formula CHO. The neutral molecules formed by the combination of the acetate ion and a \\"positive\\" ion (called a cation) are also commonly called \\"acetates\\" (hence, \\"acetate of lead\\", \\"acetate of aluminum\\", etc.). The simplest of these is hydrogen acetate (called acetic acid) with corresponding salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion CHCO, or CHCOO.\\n\\n- A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.\\n\\n- Carbonate rocks are a class of sedimentary rocks composed primarily of carbonate minerals. The two major types are limestone, which is composed of calcite or aragonite (different crystal forms of CaCO) and dolostone, which is composed of the mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO)).\\n\\n- Colostrum (known colloquially as beestings, bisnings or first milk) is a form of milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals (including humans) in late pregnancy. Most species will generate colostrum just prior to calving. Colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease. In general, protein concentration in colostrum is substantially higher than in milk. Fat concentration is substantially higher in colostrum than in milk in some species, e.g. sheep and horses, but lower in colostrum than in milk in some other species, e.g. camels and humans. In swine, fat concentration of milk at 48 to 72 hours after parturition may be higher than in colostrum or in late-lactation milk. Fat concentration in bovine colostrum is extremely variable.\\n\\n- Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- Emmentaler or Emmental is a yellow, medium-hard Swiss cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, Canton Bern. It has a savoury, but mild taste. While the denomination \\"Emmentaler Switzerland\\" is protected, \\"Emmentaler\\" alone is not; similar cheeses of other origins, especially from France and Bavaria and even Finland, are widely available and sold by that name. Emmentaler dates to the time of ancient history.\\n\\n- Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\n\\n- Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.\\n\\n- Jarlsberg is a mild cow's-milk cheese with large regular holes, that originates from Jarlsberg, Norway. Although it originated in Norway, it is also produced in Ohio and Ireland under licenses from Norwegian dairy producers.\\n\\n- Maasdam cheese is a Swiss-style Dutch cheese. Made from cow's milk, it is aged for at least 4 weeks. It ripens faster than other Dutch cheeses. Maasdam has internal holes from the ripening process, and a smooth, yellow rind. Sometimes, it is waxed like Gouda. The cheese was created to compete with the popular Swiss Emmental by being less expensive and quicker to produce. In the process of making a cheese with the same general components as Swiss cheeses, the Dutch ended up with a cheese that is nutty and sweet, but softer than Emmental due to a higher moisture content.\\n\\n- Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.\\n\\n- Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.\\n\\n- A double bond in chemistry is a chemical bond between two chemical elements involving four bonding electrons instead of the usual two. The most common double bond, that is between two carbon atoms, can be found in alkenes. Many types of double bonds exist between two different elements. For example, in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. Other common double bonds are found in azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N) and sulfoxides (S=O). In skeletal formula the double bond is drawn as two parallel lines (=) between the two connected atoms; typographically, the equals sign is used for this. Double bonds were first introduced in chemical notation by prominent Russian chemist Alexander Butlerov.\\n\\n- Ancient history is the aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with Sumerian Cuneiform script, the oldest discovered form of coherent writing from the protoliterate period around the 30th century BC.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'taxon rank' with the subject 'propionibacterium freudenreichii'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- class\\n - form\\n - group\\n - kingdom\\n - section\\n - species\\n - variety","target":"species","rationale":"The subject entity is 'propionibacterium freudenreichii' which has a relation of \\"taxon rank\\" with the object entity.\\nLooking up in the list of choices, we see that there are various ranks such as class, form, kingdom and species etc., but only one among them matches our search criteria i.e., species."},{"source":"Dialogue:\\n\\nW: What size do you wear?\\n\\nM: A twelve.\\n\\nW: Oh, you're lucky.

Virginia Stephen was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London. She was the seventh child in a blended family of eight. Her mother, Julia Stephen, celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist's model, had three children from her first marriage, her father Leslie Stephen, a notable man of letters, had one previous daughter, and four children were born in her parents' second marriage, of whom the most well known was the modernist painter, Vanessa Stephen (later Vanessa Bell).\\n\\nLeslie Stephen was in the habit of hiking in Cornwall, and in the spring of 1881 he came across a large white house in St. Ives, Cornwall, and took out a lease on it that September. Although it had limited amenities, its main attraction was the view overlooking Porthminster Bay towards the Godrevy Lighthouse, which the young Virginia could see from the upper windows and was to be the central figure in her To the Lighthouse (1927). It was a large square house, with a terraced garden, divided by hedges, sloping down towards the sea. Each year between 1882 and 1894 from mid-July to mid-September the Stephen's leased Talland House as a summer residence. Leslie Stephen, who referred to it thus: \\"a pocket-paradise\\", described it as \\"The pleasantest of my memories... refer to our summers, all of which were passed in Cornwall, especially to the thirteen summers (1882-1894) at St. Ives. There we bought the lease of Talland House: a small but roomy house, with a garden of an acre or two all up and down hill, with quaint little terraces divided by hedges of escallonia, a grape-house and kitchen-garden and a so-called 'orchard' beyond\\". It was in Leslie's words, a place of \\"intense domestic happiness\\". Virginia herself described the house in great detail:  In both London and Cornwall, Julia was perpetually entertaining, and was notorious for her manipulation of her guests' lives, constantly matchmaking in the belief everyone should be married, the domestic equivalence of her philanthropy. As her husband observed \\"My Julia was of course, though with all due reserve, a bit of a matchmaker\\". While Cornwall was supposed to be a summer respite, Julia Stephen soon immersed herself in the work of caring for the sick and poor there, as well as in London. Both at Hyde Park Gate and Talland House, the family mingled with much of the country's literary and artistic circles. Frequent guests included literary figures such as Henry James and George Meredith, as well as James Russell Lowell, and the children were exposed to much more intellectual conversations than their mother's at Little Holland House. The family did not return, following Julia Stephen's death in May 1895.  For the children it was the highlight of the year, and Virginia's most vivid childhood memories were not of London but of Cornwall. In a diary entry of 22 March 1921, she described why she felt so connected to Talland House, looking back to a summer day in August 1890. \\"Why am I so incredibly and incurably romantic about Cornwall? One's past, I suppose; I see children running in the garden ... The sound of the sea at night ... almost forty years of life, all built on that, permeated by that: so much I could never explain\\". Cornwall inspired aspects of her work, in particular the \\"St Ives Trilogy\\" of Jacob's Room (1922), To the Lighthouse (1927), and The Waves (1931).\\n\\nWhat was Talland House?","target":"a large white house in St. Ives, Cornwall,","rationale":"In the given context, Talland House is described as a large white house in St. Ives, Cornwall, which Leslie Stephen took out a lease on it that September.

In experimental animals (primates, rats, and mice), VSV has been shown to lead to neurotoxicities, such as hind limb paralysis. The virus matrix protein (M) and glycoprotein (G) are both major pathogenic determinants of wild-type VSV and have been the major targets for the production of attenuated strains. Existing strategies for attenuation included: (1) deletion or M51R substitution in the M protein (VSV M51 or VSVM51R, respectively); (2) truncation of the C-terminus of the G protein (G 28). Despite these mutations, recombinant VSV with mutated M protein is only moderately attenuated in animals, whereas there are no detailed reports to determine the pathogenicity of recombinant VSV with truncated G protein at high dose. Thus, a novel recombinant VSV (VSV M51-G 28) as well as other attenuated VSVs (VSV M51, VSV-G 28) were produced to determine their efficacy as vaccine vectors with low pathogenicity. In vitro studies indicated that truncated G protein (G 28) could play a more important role than deletion of M51 ( M51) for attenuation of recombinant VSV. VSV M51-G 28 was determined to be the most attenuated virus with low pathogenicity in mice, with VSV-G 28 also showing relatively reduced pathogenicity. Further, neutralizing antibodies stimulated by VSV-G 28 proved to be significantly higher than in mice treated with VSV M51-G 28. In conclusion, among different attenuated VSVs with mutated M and/or G proteins, recombinant VSV with only truncated G protein (VSV-G 28) demonstrated ideal balance between pathogenesis and stimulating a protective immune response. These properties make VSV-G 28 a promising vaccine vector and vaccine candidate for preventing vesicular stomatitis disease. \\n Title: Evaluation of attenuated VSVs with mutated M or/and G proteins as vaccine vectors","target":"False","rationale":"The paragraph provides results from a study that evaluated different attenuated VSV strains with mutated M or/and G proteins as vaccine vectors.

Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.\\nBy the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him.

His brother Rick owned 40 acres of grasslands, with a poor soil. Rick decided to sell his land.\\n\\nWhich brother owned a land which had large amounts of fulvic acid?\\n\\nHint: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.","target":"Bill","rationale":"Based on the given context, it is possible to infer that the forest land would have soil with a high concentration of fulvic acid. Humus in well-developed soil retains nutrients and water for plant growth. Forests are likely to receive more precipitation than grasslands, allowing excess water to percolate downward through layers of humus; this process facilitates leaching which promotes chemical weathering by increasing concentrations of organic acids like fulvic acid in soils.\\nThe answer therefore is Bill's 40 acres of forest land.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you are given two sets, and you need to count the number of elements at the intersection of two given sets.

The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826.

On Chicago's final possession of the first half, Cutler completed all of his passes, and the Bears scored on Cutler's 11-yard pass to Marshall. In the second half, Charles Tillman intercepted Ryan Lindley, and had the pick returned 10-yards for a touchdown. The interception return is the eighth by the team, one shy of the NFL record. Lindley was later replaced by Brian Hoyer, who was also ineffective, having a pass intercepted by Kelvin Hayden, who took it 39 yards to the Arizona 10. The Bears failed to take advantage of the interception, as Olindo Mare's field goal was blocked by Adrian Wilson, which was recovered by Justin Bethel, who returned the blocked kick 82 yards for the Cardinals lone touchdown. With the win, the Bears kept their playoff hopes alive, as their record improved to 9-6.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break.

Elected governor in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, Kasich is a Republican. His second term ends on January 14, 2019; he cannot stand for reelection due to term limits. A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Kasich has lived much of his adulthood in Ohio, specifically the state capital of Columbus.\\nContext: Following the separate fatal police shootings of John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Ohio, while each were holding BB guns, where grand juries decided not to indict any of the officers involved, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board \\"to address what he described as frustration and distrust among some Ohioans toward their police departments, particularly among the black community.\\" The 23-member task force (with 18 members appointed by Kasich) was appointed in January 2015 and issued its 629-page final report and recommendations in April 2015. The report recommended greater accountability and oversight for police agencies and officers, further community education and involvement in policing, and new use-of-force and recruitment, hiring, and training standards for police agencies.  In April 2015, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board, a twelve-member board tasked (in conjunction with the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services and the Ohio Department of Public Safety) with developing statewide standards for the recruiting, hiring and screening of police officers, and for the use of force (including deadly force) by police. The advisory board, the first of its kind in Ohio, was also tasked by Kasich with developing \\"model policies and best practice recommendations to promote better interaction and communication between law enforcement departments and their home communities.\\" In August 2015, the board issued its recommendations, which placed \\"an emphasis on the preservation of human life and restrict officers to defending themselves or others from death or serious injury.\\"  In August 2015, Kasich said that he was open to the idea of requiring police officers to wear body cameras.\\nQuestion: What did the report recommend?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"The report recommended greater accountability and oversight for police agencies and officers, further community education and","rationale":"From the given context, the answer obviously seems to be: The report recommended greater accountability and oversight for police agencies and officers, further community education and involvement in policing"},{"source":"Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

At the same voltage, DC often has less loss than AC, and for this reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire. Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. A few railroads have tried 3-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle.

If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef.

TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995.

Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her.

After the first three possessions of the game ended in punts, the struck first blood, driving all the way to the Lions 2-yard line, but could only muster a 19-yard field goal by Shayne Graham. The Lions countered, driving 71 yards in 11 plays, scoring on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Shaun Hill to Calvin Johnson. After a Patriots punt, another long Lions drive, going 63 yards in 13 plays, ended with running back Maurice Morris punching through a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the Lions lead to 14-3. The Patriots answered their touchdown with one of their own, marching 83 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 15-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis with 0:45 seconds left in the half. The Lions appeared to have stopped the Patriots after Brady threw an incomplete pass on 3rd-and-6, but DeAndre Levy was called for pass interference, giving the Patriots a 1st down. Stefan Logan returned the ensuing kickoff 30 yards to the Lions 33. The return allowed the Lions to drive to the Patriots 26 and Dave Rayner was good on a 44-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-10 halftime lead. After forcing a Patriots punt, McCourty intercepted Hill on an underthrown pass, and returned it 23 yards to the Lions' 26. Five plays later, Brady threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Welker, tying the game 17-17. However, the Patriots weak defense couldn't catch a break. Aided by Logan's 42-yard return, the Lions countered, marching 58 yards in 9 plays, with Morris scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run, putting the Lions back out in front, 24-17. The Patriots needed just three plays to strike back, with Brady finding Branch deep on a 79-yard touchdown, capping off the 87-yard drive and tying the game 24-24. This was the Patriots' longest play from scrimmage of their 2010 season. After a 30-yard kick return by Logan, the Lions drove all the way to the Patriots 28, but Rayner missed a 46-yard field goal, keeping the game tied. The Patriots regained the lead on their ensuing drive, with Brady completing 3/3 passes for 59 yards on a 64-yard drive, finding Branch again on a 22-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter. After a Lions punt, the Patriots marched 84 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Welker, extending the lead to 38-24. On the third play of the Lions' next drive, Hill was intercepted by McCourty, who returned it 50 yards to the Lions 12. Four plays later, the Patriots put the game out of reach with a 1-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis, making the score 45-24. During the extra point and afterwards, the Lions were called for three personal fouls, including one on defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. This allowed the Patriots to kick off from the Lions' 40-yard line, and Graham was able to put the ball through the uprights, to a storm of boos from the Ford Field crowd. The Lions drove to the Patriots 6-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs and the Patriots took a knee to end the game. With the win, New England improved to 9-2.

Local housewives with Spanish relatives in the Campo area kept their radios tuned to the nearby Spanish stations for news of family members who were gravely ill.

Spain applied to join the European Economic Community (EEC) and NATO, for which it needed British support. In 1980, talks between British and Spanish ministers led to the Lisbon Agreement, a statement on co-operation between the two countries which committed them to starting negotiations on Gibraltar's future and lifting the Spanish restrictions on communications with Gibraltar. Although Britain promised to \\"honour the freely and democratically expressed wishes of the people of Gibraltar\\", Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher indicated in the House of Commons that sovereignty would be on the table, in a change from the previous policy. However, the border was not reopened due to \\"technical issues\\" – code for unresolved issues between the two governments – and the agreement was strongly opposed by many Gibraltarians, who did not wish their sovereignty to be under discussion and objected to the lack of Gibraltarian representatives at the talks.

Since there were two instances where there were eggplants involved but only one instance where someone had false beliefs about their location (Jack thinking his eggplant was inside of his blue bathtub), you can conclude that Emily's false belief matches with her actions since she moved what is really an eggplant into what she believes is not only empty but also happens to be conveniently named \\"green_bucket\\" -- thereby matching up with what we know so far about how this scenario works.\\""},{"source":"Answer the question below:\\n\\n\\nWill's pupils grew larger as the night grew darker.

One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.\\n\\n- In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.\\n\\n- Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties.

Holliday became one of the first 100 employees of Tracor in 1962 and quickly became Director of Analysis and Applied Research in the Electronic Systems Division . In 1965 Holliday left Austin to develop the Tracor facility in San Diego and began his doctorate in applied physics at the University of California , San Diego . In San Diego Holliday began his study in acoustics for which he is known . His study of transient flow in natural gas pipelines led to the publication of a textbook which is still used as a standard reference . In the 1970s Holliday began testing a revolutionary technique for the detection and size measurement of zooplankton in thin layers involving multi-frequency backscattering . The technique developed and after twenty years became the established framework for research in the field . In the early 1980s Holliday built the first prototype of the Tracor Acoustical Profiling System ( TAPS ) which has been described as decades ahead of its time by the Acoustical Society of America . TAPS is now the standard instrument for acoustical profiling of plankton in the sea . Holliday published hundreds of papers on underwater acoustics and acoustical oceanography and given dozens of talks and symposia in several countries .

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut.

In response, in February 1917, the German General Staff convinced Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after 5 to 6 months, before American intervention could make an impact. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000 tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000 tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced convoy system became effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated. On 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead.\\nAugustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s.

I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness.\\nBut when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker.\\nField recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.\\nQuestion: What desert did the author say was a fixture at Easter tables around Italy?\\nOptions:\\n- sugar cookies \\n - not enough information \\n - cotton candy \\n - colomba\\n===\\nThe correct answer is","target":"colomba","rationale":"The author mentions that the Easter equivalent to panettone is colomba and goes on to describe how it’s made.

Passage 1:The \\"three now cosmopolitan commensal rodent pest species\\" (the brown rat, the black rat and the house mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration, and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), have severely damaged island biotas around the world. For example, when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918, over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island, including the Lord Howe fantail, became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island (1943) and Big South Cape Island (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as brodifacoum. This approach has been successful on the island of Lundy in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of Manx shearwater and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near-extinction.\\n Passage 2:He began his studies in Poland and continued his education at the University of Leuven. His considerable wealth enabled him to establish his own private army, which suppressed Cossack riots and Tatar raids in Ukraine. In 1635 he became the first voivode of the Czernihów Voivodship. In 1646 he was appointed Field Crown Hetman. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, he was captured by the Tatars after the Battle of Korsun in 1648. He was a prisoner-of-war until 1650 when he was ransomed. On 12 May 1651 he commanded victorious Polish army in the Battle of Kopyczyńce between Poles and combined Cossack-Tatar forces under chief Asand Demko. In 1651, during the subsequent hostilities between the Commonwealth and Cossack-Tatar alliance, he was the nominal commander of the Polish army right wing at the great victorious Battle of Beresteczko (de facto commanded Jeremi Wiśniowiecki). Upon death of Grand Crown Hetman Mikołaj Potocki, who was his political and personal adversary, hetman Kalinowski commanded the choicest elements of the Commonwealth army and he had at the camp at Batoh about 10–12,000 soldiers and 10–15,000 servants and camp followers. This army was surprised by the combined Cossack-Tatar army, consequently defeated and then capture of Polish soldiers and servants resulted in a wholesale slaughter of the best elements of Commonwealth army and their retinues, the event known as Battle of Batoh. Hetman was killed on 2 June 1652, during the last day of the battle, when trying to escape from the Cossack-Tatars-filled burning Polish camp, in woods some 3 kilometers from the Polish camp. Hetman's severed head was carried around the Cossack-Tatar camps, allegedly by the Nuredin-Sultan himself.\\n Passage 3:In the late 1950s, Dunstan became well known for his campaign against the death penalty being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Premier Thomas Playford IV aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as a turning point in the Liberal and Country League's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy. Labor conducted an extensive campaign in marginal LCL seats at the 1965 election, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with Frank Walsh and the Labor Party taking power and Dunstan becoming Attorney-General. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young Steele Hall, worrying Labor as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in Labor replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander and was able to convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election. With a fairer seat and boundary system in place, Dunstan won three more elections, in 1973, 1975 and 1977.","target":"1","rationale":"The passage 1 provides the answer to the question."},{"source":"Multi-select: Is it possible to draw the conclusion that \\"Jane was out.\\" if \\"Jane knocked on Susan's door, but there was no answer.

Since Option 1 says that \\"He worked out more\\", then logically you would expect him to gain weight not loose any since working out builds muscle mass which weighs more than fat mass for a given amount of tissue volume; however since this story states that he lost 43 pounds in total during that summer, then Option 2 must be correct because it suggests by implication that \\"He also [watched his diet very carefully]\\""},{"source":"What is the next dialog turn?

Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with Moving Pictures (1981), began to return to a hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada.

To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles.\\nIt is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure.

After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.\\nTeasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates.

During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices.

In these patients, we observed an endoscopic aspect, consisting of multiple small erythematous areas, outlined by a subtle yellowish network (resembling a mosaic), mainly located in the proximal part of the stomach. We tested the value of this sign by comparing two groups: 100 patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, and 300 control patients without signs of liver disease or portal hypertension. This endoscopic pattern was observed in 94 of the patients with cirrhosis, whereas oesophageal varices were seen in 78 only. In contrast, only one patient of the control group had this aspect. Moreover, this sign was also found in seven of eight patients with non cirrhotic portal hypertension, but was seen neither in 100 patients with chronic alcoholism but without liver disease, nor in 10 cirrhotic patients with end-to-side portacaval shunts. These endoscopic changes might be because of mucosal and/or submucosal oedema and congestion highlighting the normal areae gastricae pattern and related to raised portal pressure.

One kappa and two lambda type light chains (lambda-1 and lambda-2) were isolated from urines of patients with multiple myeloma. At maximal inhibitory concentrations the kappa chain reduced alanine uptake from 206 +/- 18 to 77 +/- 18 pmole/mg protein (P less than 0.005) and glucose uptake from 357 +/- 22 to 146 +/- 8 pmole/mg protein (P less than 0.001). lambda-1 reduced alanine uptake from 136 +/- 17 to 60 +/- 8 pmole/mg protein (P less than 0.005) and glucose uptake from 354 +/- 17 to 77 +/- 14 pmole/mg protein (P less than 0.001). lambda-2 reduced alanine uptake from 105 +/- 9 to 28 +/- 5 pmole/mg protein (P less than 0.001) and glucose uptake from 194 +/- 7 to 66 +/- 7 pmole/mg protein (P less than 0.001). The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (I50) of kappa, lambda-1 and lambda-2 light chains were 68, 76 and 140 microM for alanine uptake and 120, 70 and 105 microM for glucose uptake. Control experiments using bovine serum albumin and beta-lactoglobulin showed no inhibitory effect on alanine and glucose uptake by either protein.

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes 'the principle of equality of its citizens' and is meant to be founded on 'representative democracy'. In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and 'qualified majorities' or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this 'democratic deficit' under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are 'degressively proportional' according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste 'Les Verts' v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power ('kratia') is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people ('demos'): in the EU it is not yet true that 'the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.'

Transvaginal mesh operations usually result in minor pain or discomfort for a few days after the operation. Bleeding may occur for a few hours after surgery, but most women leave the hospital on the same day as the procedure. Surgical mesh is a loosely woven sheet which is used as either a permanent or temporary support for organs and other tissues during surgery. Surgical mesh is created from both inorganic and biological materials and is used in a variety of surgeries. Though hernia repair surgery is the most common application, it can also be used for reconstructive work, such as in pelvic organ prolapse. Permanent meshes remain in the body, whereas temporary ones dissolve over time. For example, TIGR Matrix test I had surgery on 7/07/17 to repair an incisional hernia.

The amount of time that it takes to complete a dental implant procedure often depends upon your specific situation. Upper vs. Lower Jaw. Bone anywhere in your body will usually take a few weeks to heal, and the same is true of your jawbone. The upper jaw is comprised of softer bone, meaning dental implants in this area typically take longer to heal. The lower jaw bone is typically much more dense, making it possible to heal from dental implant surgery faster. Dental Implant Techniques Once the skin stretching is completed, you'll most likely have more surgery to replace the tissue expander with a permanent implant. Surgery is usually scheduled about 4 to 6 weeks after the last amount of liquid has been added to the expander. Surgery to insert the permanent implant takes about an hour. If radiation therapy is part of your treatment plan, most surgeons prefer that the radiation happen while you still have the tissue expander.

It is considered an important symbol of the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of Latvia. Unveiled in 1935, the 42-metre (138 ft) high monument of granite, travertine, and copper often serves as the focal point of public gatherings and official ceremonies in Riga.\\nThe sculptures and bas-reliefs of the monument, arranged in thirteen groups, depict Latvian culture and history. The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other, decreasing in size towards the top, completed by a 19-metre (62 ft) high travertine column bearing the copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars. The concept for the monument first emerged in the early 1920s when the Latvian Prime Minister, Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics, ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a \\"memorial column\\". After several contests the monument was finally built at the beginning of the 1930s according to the scheme \\"Mirdzi kā zvaigzne!\\" (\\"Shine like a star!\\") submitted by Latvian sculptor Kārlis Zāle. Construction works were financed by private donations.\\nFollowing the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out.

In 1963, when the issue of demolition was raised again, it was dismissed by Soviet authorities as the destruction of the building would have caused deep indignation and tension in society. Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of the monument to better fit with Communist ideology, but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public.

They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.\\n\\n- <section begin=lead />The human genome is the complete set of nucleic acid sequence for humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\"), encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosome pairs in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within individual mitochondria. Human genomes include both protein-coding DNA genes and noncoding DNA. Haploid human genomes, which are contained in germ cells (the egg and sperm gamete cells created in the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction before fertilization creates a zygote) consist of three billion DNA base pairs, while diploid genomes (found in somatic cells) have twice the DNA content. While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1%), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (approximately 4%) and bonobos.<section end=lead />\\n\\n- A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats.\\n\\n- Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.\\n\\n- An allosome (also referred to as a sex chromosome, heterotypical chromosome, heterochromosome, or idiochromosome) is a chromosome that differs from an ordinary autosome in form, size, and behavior. The human sex chromosomes, a typical pair of mammal allosomes, determine the sex of an individual created in sexual reproduction. Autosomes differ from allosomes because autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but differ from other pairs in a diploid cell, whereas members of an allosome pair may differ from one another and thereby determine sex.\\n\\n- 48, XXYY syndrome is a sex chromosome anomaly in which males have an extra X and Y chromosome. Human cells usually contain two sex chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father. Usually, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The appearance of at least one Y chromosome with a properly functioning SRY gene makes a male. Therefore, humans with XXYY are normally males. Males with XXYY syndrome have 48 chromosomes instead of the typical 46. This is why XXYY syndrome is sometimes written as 48, XXYY syndrome. It is estimated that XXYY affects one in every 18,00040,000 male births.\\n\\n- XYY syndrome is a genetic condition in which a human male has an extra male (Y) chromosome, giving a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the more usual 46. This produces a 47,XYY karyotype, which occurs every 1 in 1,000 male births.\\n\\n- Aneuploidy is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, for example a human cell having 45 or 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. It does not include a difference of one or more complete sets of chromosomes, which is called \\"euploidy\\". An extra or missing chromosome is a common cause of genetic disorders, including some human birth defects. Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes. Aneuploidy originates during cell division when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells.\\n\\n- The X chromosome is one of the two sex-determining chromosomes (allosomes) in many animal species, including mammals (the other is the Y chromosome), and is found in both males and females. It is a part of the XY sex-determination system and X0 sex-determination system. The X chromosome was named for its unique properties by early researchers, which resulted in the naming of its counterpart Y chromosome, for the next letter in the alphabet, after it was discovered later.\\n\\n- Ellobius is a genus of rodents in the family Cricetidae . It contains two ( E. lutescens and E. tancrei ) of the handful of examples of mammal species that have lost the Y chromosome . The genus has the following species : Alai mole vole ( Ellobius alaicus ) Southern mole vole ( Ellobius fuscocapillus ) Transcaucasian mole vole ( Ellobius lutescens ) Northern mole vole ( Ellobius talpinus ) Zaisan mole vole ( Ellobius tancrei )\\n\\n- Hamsters are rodents belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae. The subfamily contains about 25 species, classified in six or seven genera. They have become established as popular small house pets, and partly because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals.\\n\\n- The Cricetidae are a family of rodents in the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. It includes true hamsters, voles, lemmings, and New World rats and mice. At almost 600 species, it is the second-largest family of mammals, and has members throughout the Americas, Asia, and Europe.\\n\\n- Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.\\n\\n- The Y chromosome is one of two sex chromosomes (allosomes) in mammals, including humans, and many other animals. The other is the X chromosome. Y is the sex-determining chromosome in many species, since it is the presence or absence of Y that determines the male or female sex of offspring produced in sexual reproduction. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains the gene SRY, which triggers testis development. The DNA in the human Y chromosome is composed of about 59 million base pairs. The Y chromosome is passed only from father to son. With a 30% difference between humans and chimpanzees, the Y chromosome is one of the fastest-evolving parts of the human genome. To date, over 200 Y-linked genes have been identified. All Y-linked genes are expressed and (apart from duplicated genes) hemizygous (present on only one chromosome) except in the cases of aneuploidy such as XYY syndrome or XXYY syndrome. (See Y linkage.)\\n\\n- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.\\n\\n- A lemming is a small rodent, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. Lemmings are subniveal animals and together with voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils.\\n\\n- A base pair (bp) is a unit consisting of two nucleobases bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. They form the building blocks of the DNA double helix, and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and RNA. Dictated by specific hydrogen bonding patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-thymine) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its nucleotide sequence. The complementary nature of this based-paired structure provides a backup copy of all genetic information encoded within double-stranded DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which DNA polymerase replicates DNA, and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.\\n\\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- The New World rats and mice are a group of related rodents found in North and South America. They are extremely diverse in appearance and ecology, ranging in from the tiny \\"Baiomys\\" to the large \\"Kunsia\\". They represent one of the few examples of muroid rodents (along with the voles) in North America, and the only example of muroid rodents to have made it into South America.\\n\\n- The Muroidea are a large superfamily of rodents, including mice, rats, voles, hamsters, gerbils, and many other relatives. They occupy a vast variety of habitats on every continent except Antarctica.

I’m in my last year now. A couple of days ago, my sister also moved back with plans to start grad school in the fall. So...it’s a little crowded. My sister rented a uhaul for her stuff and had it parked in front of the house. My mom and I took it back yesterday, with my mom driving the truck and me following behind in my car. Then, we drove back home together.\\n\\nMy family and I live in a row house. There’s a parking spot right in front of the house, and another one down the street. Those spots are where my parents park, and I usually park on the street. So I’m driving my mom home and I go to park where I usually park, and she tells me to just park in the spot in front of the house. I kind of protest, because I don’t want to have to move my car later, and tell her I’ll just drop her off in front of the house and then go park on the street. At this point she gets a little irritated with me and tells me to just park in front of the house and leave it alone. I’m like, fine, whatever, not a big deal. \\n\\nLater that day my dad comes home and asks why I’m parked in front of the house. I told him what happened with my mom. I can tell he’s kind of annoyed that I parked there, but I don’t think it’s a big deal so I just brush it off. \\n\\nNow today, I have the day off and I’m just hanging out at home. I go to the basement and am working out on the treadmill when my dad comes down the stairs. He says: “hey, so your mother and I had a discussion about the parking spot and it’s okay if you move your car”. Now at this point I’m irritated. I said something along the lines of “what are you talking about? I know I’m ALLOWED to move my car, all I said is that I parked there because mom told me to and I didn’t feel like arguing with her!” Now I know I kind of blew up here, but I was annoyed because  i could tell he just wanted me to move my car and I don’t like when people beat around the bush. \\n\\nI finished my workout, took a shower, then I’m just in the living room when here comes my dad again.

The present study was performed to determine whether curcumin is efficacious against both collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice and IL-1beta-induced activation in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). DBA/1 mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen (CII) and treated with curcumin every other day for 2weeks after the initial immunization. For arthritis, we evaluated the incidence of disease and used an arthritis index based on paw thickness. In vitro proliferation of CII- or concanavalin A-induced splenic T cells was examined using IFN-gamma production. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were examined in the mouse ankle joint and serum IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes were analyzed. The expression levels of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in human FLSs were also determined. The results showed that compared with untreated CIA mice, curcumin-treated mice downregulated clinical arthritis score, the proliferation of splenic T cells, expression levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in the ankle joint, and expression levels of IgG2a in serum. Additionally, by altering nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription activity in FLSs, curcumin inhibited PGE(2) production, COX-2 expression, and MMP secretion. These results suggest that curcumin can effectively suppress inflammatory response by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators and regulating humoral and cellular immune responses.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract is organized into sections such as \\"Introduction\\", \\"Materials and Methods\\", \\"Results\\" and \\"Conclusions\\".

During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records.
