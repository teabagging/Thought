This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.\\n\\n- Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States.

Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent.\\n\\n- A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.\\nA metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.\\n\\n- Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.\\n\\n- Boston (pronounced ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States.

The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.7 million people in 2014 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. Alternately, as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest as such in the United States.\\n\\n- Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York.\\n\\n- New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population.\\n\\n- Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- Accord Pond ( pronounced Ah - cord with a long A ) is a 100 - acre ( 0.40 km2 ) reservoir in Hingham , Norwell and Rockland , Massachusetts . The reservoir is located off Route 228 at its terminus with Route 3 . The reservoir is visible from Route 3 northbound at Exit 14 , the Route 228 off - ramp . The reservoir is a Class A source of water supply for the town of Hingham and Hull Ma . The outflow of the reservoir is Accord Brook , a tributary of the Weir River . Accord , a village in Hingham on the Hingham / Norwell town line , lies on the northeastern shore of the reservoir along Route 53 .\\n\\n- The Massachusett are a Native American people who historically lived in areas surrounding Massachusetts Bay, as well as northeast and southern Massachusetts in what is now the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including present-day Greater Boston. Tribal members spoke the Massachusett language, which is part of the Algonquian language family.

The local government is effective at combating these fires, but there are still quite a few over the course of a year. Sally lives somewhere that has never had a wildfire before, and she wasn't even aware they existed until her brother started talking about them.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream...\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Who will experience a sore throat more often?","target":"Bobby","rationale":"The background of the question mentions that wildfire smoke contains particulate matter, and inhalation can cause coughing and sore throat. It also notes that coarse particles are often heavier and more toxic than fine particles, so they have a stronger impact on health in the short term.\\nSince there is context to suggest Bobby lives in an area with wildfires but Sally does not, it's likely he would be exposed to wildfire smoke more frequently than she would be. If exposure causes sore throat as mentioned above this means Bobby will experience a sore throat more often since his sister doesn't live somewhere with regular wildfires like he does.

Hittin’ the Target. Now you’re ready to determine your target training heart rate. As you exercise, periodically: Take your pulse on the inside of your wrist, on the thumb side. For most of us, between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is normal. 1 The rate can be affected by factors like stress, anxiety, hormones, medication, and how physically active you are. An athlete or more active person may have a resting heart rate as low as 40 beats per minute. Now that’s chill! When it comes to resting heart rate, lower is better. 150 beats per minute Important Note: A few high blood pressure medications lower the maximum heart rate and thus the target zone rate. If you're taking such medicine, call your physician to find out if you need to use a lower target heart rate. Use the tips of your first two fingers (not your thumb) to press lightly over the blood vessels on your wrist. Count your pulse for 10 seconds and multiply by 6 to find your beats per minute. You want to stay between 50 percent to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. This range is your target heart rate. Know Your Numbers. This table shows estimated target heart rates for different ages. Your maximum heart rate is about 220 minus your age. Count your pulse for 30 seconds and multiply by 2 to find your beats per minute. Important Note: Some drugs and medications affect heart rate, meaning you may have a lower maximum heart rate and target zone. Before you learn how to calculate and monitor your target training heart rate, you have to know your resting heart rate. Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute while it’s at rest. You can check it in the morning after you’ve had a good night’s sleep and before you get out of bed. According to the National Institute of Health, the average resting heart rate: 1  for children 10 years and older, and adults (including seniors) is 60 - 100 beats per minute. 2  for well-trained athletes is 40 - 60 beats per minute. Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute when you’re at rest. A good time to check it is in the morning after you’ve had a good night’s sleep, before you get out of bed or grab that first cup of java! The easiest way to do this is to use a generic formula meant for the average person. For men, your maximum heart rate can be estimated by subtracting your age in years from 220. For example, a 20-year-old man would have a maximum heart rate of 200 beats per minute. For women, a newer standard is to take 88 percent of your age and subtract it from 206. Beats Per Minute in Exercise. The speed of your heart rate depends on the intensity of exercise that you wish to work at. The American Heart Association recommends exercising somewhere between 50 to 85 percent of your maximum. Beginners should start at the low end of this range and work up as fitness levels improve. There are three general ways to classify heart rate, 1) normal, 2) fast and 3) slow. A resting heart rate is normal between 60-100 beats per minute. A resting heart rate is fast (i.e. tachycardic) at greater than 100 beats per minute. A resting heart rate is slow (i.e. bradycardic) at less than 60 beats per minute.

During the GDR period, church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990. Today over two thirds of the population is non-religious. The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany has had the largest number of members in the state, adhered to by 24.0% of the population in 2009. Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.8% of the population, while 68.2% of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths. The highest Protestant concentrations are in the small villages of southern and western Thuringia, whereas the bigger cities are even more non-religious (up to 88% in Gera). Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rhön Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia.

That year she had travelled from Kenya to visit her family in Dusseldorf and Bonn, Germany and gone to the Netherlands to escape an alleged arranged marriage. Once there, she requested political asylum and obtained a residence permit. She used her paternal grandfather's early surname on her application and has since been known in the West as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She received a residence permit within three or four weeks of arriving in the Netherlands.  At first she held various short-term jobs, ranging from cleaning to sorting post. She worked as a translator at a Rotterdam refugee center which, according to a friend interviewed in 2006 by The Observer newspaper, marked her deeply.  As an avid reader, in the Netherlands she found new books and ways of thought that both stretched her imagination and frightened her. Sigmund Freud's work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in Driebergen. She has said that she was impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at Leiden University, obtaining an MSc degree in political science in 2000.  Between 1995 and 2001, Hirsi Ali also worked as an independent Somali-Dutch interpreter and translator, frequently working with Somali women in asylum centers, hostels for abused women, and at the Dutch immigration and naturalization service (IND, Immigratie en Naturalisatiedienst).

He is the only horse to have won the Triple Crown while having been undefeated in any race previous. Honored as the 1977 Horse of the Year, he was also a champion at age two, three and four. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth.\\n\\nSeattle Slew stood at stud at Spendthrift Farm in Lexington for seven years, before moving to Three Chimneys Farm in Midway in 1985. He was the leading sire of 1984, when his son Swale (who died later that year) won the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. His other progeny include the talented, ill-fated 1982 champion two-year-old filly, Landaluce, Slew o' Gold (winner of the 1983 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the 1984 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Male Horse), 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy and the 2000 champion three-year-old filly Surfside. He is part of a unique three generation sequence of Belmont Stakes Winners: Seattle Slew (1977) - A.P. Indy (1992) - Rags to Riches (2004).  The primary conduit for Seattle Slew's continuation of his male line has been through A.P. Indy. A.P. Indy has done well at stud in Kentucky, siring (among others) the 2003 Horse of the Year, Mineshaft. One of Seattle Slew's most successful grandsons is the California champion Lava Man (sired by Slew City Slew). In 2006, Lava Man became the first horse to win the Santa Anita Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic Stakes in the same year. Seattle Slew was also a leading broodmare sire, his daughters producing (among others) Cigar (leading North American money-earner of his day). Races in honor of his dam, My Charmer, include the My Charmer Handicap held at Florida's Calder Race Course annually and the My Charmer Stakes held at Kentucky's Turfway Park.  Rags to Riches, a granddaughter, won the 2007 Belmont Stakes - the third filly to win the race, after Ruthless in 1867 and Tanya in 1905. The victory earned jockey John Velazquez and trainer Todd Pletcher their first wins in any Triple Crown race. Rags To Riches was the 22nd filly to run in the Belmont. In 2002, ESPN telecast a \\"SportsCentury\\" on Seattle Slew.  In 2014, Seattle Slew's great-great grandson, California Chrome, won the Kentucky Derby  and the Preakness. California Chrome was the second Kentucky Derby winner in a row who was a sire-line descendant of Seattle Slew, following Orb in 2013. California Chrome's bid for the Triple Crown was defeated by another great-grandson of Seattle Slew, Tonalist, by leading sire Tapit. Tapit also sired the winners of the 2016 and 2017 Belmont Stakes, Creator and Tapwrit respectively.  25 years to the day after he won the Kentucky Derby, Seattle Slew died in his sleep at age 28. He was buried whole, the highest honor for a winning race horse, in the courtyard at Hill 'N' Dale Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, with his favorite blanket and a bag of peppermints which he liked to eat. Three Chimneys Farm erected a statue of Seattle Slew near the stallion barn in his honor. Since fellow Triple Crown winner and rival Affirmed had died the year before, he was the sole living Triple Crown winner. At the horse's death, there were no living Triple Crown winners for the first time since Sir Barton won the first Triple Crown in 1919.

The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields.

After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described..., can you guess it ?","target":"Euridice","rationale":"The question asks for the title of two separate works by different composers.

Two of these are Euridice by Jacopo Peri and Giulio Caccini both composed in 1600; they were among many musical representations recounting Orpheus' myth as told in Ovid's Metamorphoses, forerunning Monteverdi's L'Orfeo (1607).

Based on our previous studies showing that feeding on an amino acid meal induces TOR signaling in Ae. aegypti, we used proteomics and RNAi to functionally identify midgut epithelial cell proteins that contribute to RER whorl formation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were maintained on sugar alone (unfed), or fed an amino acid meal, and then midgut epithelial cells were analyzed by electron microscopy and protein biochemistry. The size and number of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells were found to decrease significantly after feeding, and several KDELcontaining proteins were shown to have altered expression levels. LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry was used to analyze midgut microsomal proteins isolated from unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes, and of the 127 proteins identified, 8 were chosen as candidate whorl forming proteins. Three candidate proteins were COPI coatomer subunits (alpha, beta, beta'), all of which appeared to be present at higher levels in microsomal fractions from unfed mosquitoes. Using RNAi to knockdown alpha-COPI expression, electron microscopy revealed that both the size and number of RER whorls were dramatically reduced in unfed mosquitoes, and moreover, that extended regions of swollen RER were prevalent in fed mosquitoes. Lastly, while a deficiency in alpha-COPI had no effect on early trypsin protein synthesis or secretion 3 hr post blood meal (PBM), expression of late phase proteases at 24 hr PBM was completely blocked. Conclusions: alpha-COPI was found to be required for the formation of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells of unfed Aa. aegypti mosquitoes, as well as for the expression of late phase midgut proteases.","target":"Alpha-COPI Coatomer Protein Is Required for Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum Whorl Formation in Mosquito Midgut Epithelial Cells","rationale":"The title should reflect the key finding that alpha-COPI is required for rough endoplasmic reticulum whorl formation in mosquito midgut epithelial cells.

The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, 901-foot (275 m)-tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside of a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, there was a mini-boom of mid-rise and high-rise residential tower construction, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings have gone up in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units.

The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME). Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (±SD) age of 52 ± 6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 10 10 cfu of ampicillinsensitive P. multocida. Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14. Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m. once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m. once daily for 3 d] when ≥1 cm 2 of lung consolidation was observed and ≥6 h had elapsed since challenge. Lung lesions ≥1 cm 2 were considered positive for consolidation. Calves were respiratory score positive if ≥2 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 ± 28, CON: 96 ± 17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection. Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health. \\n Title: Effect of antibiotic treatment in preweaned Holstein calves after experimental bacterial challenge with Pasteurella multocida","target":"True","rationale":"The title describes the objective of the study, which is to investigate the effect of ampicillin on ultrasonographic (US) lung consolidation after experimental challenge with Pasteurella multocida in pre-weaned dairy calves.

He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked vigilante who defends the commoners and indigenous peoples of California against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black costume includes a cape, a hat known as sombrero cordobes, and a domino mask that covers the upper part of his face. In the stories, Zorro has a high bounty on his head, but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them.\\nContext: In The Curse of Capistrano, Senor Zorro became an outlaw in the pueblo of Los Angeles in California \\"to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed.\\" He is the title character, as he is dubbed the \\"Curse of Capistrano\\". The novel features extensively both Don Diego Vega and Zorro, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, both Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless fop, she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also has his eyes on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro's enemy but Diego's friend; Diego's deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega, the richest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Dona Catalina, Lolita's parents; and a group of noblemen (caballeros) who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause.  In later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro's identity.  In McCulley's later stories, Diego's surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive and the next entry had the double identity still secret.  Several Zorro productions have expanded on the character's exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.  McCulley's stories are set during the during the era of Spanish California (1769-1821) and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded. Some media adaptations of Zorro's story have placed him during the later era of Mexican California (1821-1846).\\nQuestion: Who all was he able to help?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"to aid the oppressed.","rationale":"The context states that Zorro became an outlaw to aid the oppressed.

He is then transferred by train to Stalag VI-A prisoner of war camp at Hemer, Germany. While en route, a P-51 Mustang attacks (the letters POW were painted on the top of the train, but got covered by thick snow). To save themselves, the POWs leave the train and spell P-O-W with their bodies and prevent further strafing.\\nAfter arriving at the new POW camp, Lt. Hart is interviewed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.","target":"Dan","rationale":"Pete and Dan were both campers that had canned soup with them. Pete did not vent his can of soup, so the air inside heated up quickly until it exploded due to an increase in pressure. As a result, he learned less about air molecules moving faster than Dan who opened his can before heating it over the fire and didn’t have any issues (no explosion). Because only one camper was affected by this issue, we know they are different people.

Only one of 109 cases reviewed gave a history of birth by cesarean section, whereas ten cesarean deliveries would have been the expected number for this group on the basis of national rates. The single case was delivered by elective cesarean section before the rupture of the membranes, and the child developed respiratory papillomatosis in the first year of life. These findings suggest that in juvenile-onset disease, the transmission of infection from mother to child occurs most often during passage through an infected birth canal, but that intrauterine infection of the fetus is also possible. Papillomavirus infection of the female genital tract is common, but respiratory papillomatosis is rare. On the basis of crude estimates of annual number of children born to infected mothers and of new cases of juvenile-onset disease, the risk of developing disease for a child born to an infected mother was calculated to be one in several hundred exposures.","target":"Cesarean Section","rationale":"The abstract focuses on the relationship between cesarean section and respiratory papillomatosis and mentions that only one child with respiratory papillomatosis out of 109 cases reviewed had a history of birth by cesarean section, whereas 10 cesarean deliveries would have been expected in this group. The abstract also states that \\"in juvenile-onset disease, the transmission of infection from mother to child occurs most often during passage through an infected birth canal, but that intrauterine infection of the fetus is also possible\\". Thus, it implies that transmission may be affected by whether a baby is delivered vaginally or by cesarean section. In addition, given that there are multiple types of papillomaviruses and they can cause different diseases in different parts of the body (e.g., respiratory tract vs genital tract), it's likely safe to assume that those born via vaginal delivery are more likely to develop respiratory papilloma than those born via c-section. As such, I propose \\"Cesarean Section\\" as a keyword for this abstract since it provides an explanation for why there were fewer children with respiratory papilloma than expected.\\""},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu.","target":"Philip the Good","rationale":"The context above lists a number of factors that led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators.

He has a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again.\\n\\nIn 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF's blog, Swift. Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle, a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day.  Beginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi's retirement from the JREF.  James Randi began a series of conferences known as \\"The Amazing Meeting\\" - TAM - which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted large percentage of younger folks. Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast Skepticality and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast Point of Inquiry. From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled \\"Randi Speaks.\\" In addition, The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format.  In 2014 Part2Filmworks released An Honest Liar, a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Pena. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It has since been captioned in ten different languages, shown worldwide, and was also positively received by critics. The film was featured on the PBS Independent Lens series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016.  In 2017, he appeared in animated form on Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse and indicated that this is a balance many magicians struggle with.\\n\\nWhat is Swift?","target":"JREF's blog,","rationale":"The answer is the JREF's blog, Swift.

Pittsburgh had lost the previous week to Cincinnati to fall to 0-2 for the first time in 11 years. In the last game between the two in 2009, the Bears triumphed 17-14. The Bears were the 1-point favorites; eight CBSSports.com experts voted on their predictions for the game, with a 5-3 result favoring Chicago, while four ESPN analysts predicted that the Steelers would win. One of the goals of the defense was to contain Ben Roethlisberger in the passing pocket, especially as the offensive line suffered the loss of center Maurkice Pouncey. Additionally, the Steelers also had the 31st-ranked rushing offense and had yet to score a rushing touchdown, who was expected to regain first-rounder Le'Veon Bell. Alan Rubenstein of ChicagoNow writes that the Bears should attempt to improve their pass rush, which was only able to record two sacks in the last two games. Marc Trestman cited the weather as a factor for the poor performance, stating, \\"It's tough to rush the passer in wet weather... For both sides. It's tough to get a pass rush with a soggy field and a wet field. It's an advantage throwing the football. On a rainy day (versus) no rain, really the advantage goes to the offense. Because we can sit back there and protect. And it's really hard to configure a pass rush to get close.\\" On offense, the Bears should attempt to attack the Steelers' 14th-ranked rush defense. A key matchup was the WR-CB duel between Brandon Marshall and Ike Taylor; Taylor contained Bengals receiver A. J. Green, who recorded 162 yards against the Bears in week one, to just six catches for 41 yards in week two. Chicago started the game with Robbie Gould's field goal, followed by Matt Fort&#233; and Michael Bush's touchdown runs to take a 17-0 lead in the first quarter. Pittsburgh then scored on Shaun Suisham's 27-yard field goal, but the Bears then scored after Major Wright returned Roethlisberger's interception 38 yards for a touchdown for the 24-3 lead at halftime. In the second half, the Steelers began to rally with Roethlisberger throwing two touchdown passes of 33 and 21 yards to Antonio Brown, followed by Suisham kicking two more field goals to narrow the margin to 27-23. However, Jay Cutler threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Earl Bennett; the pass was initially ruled as incomplete, but was reversed. Eventually, Lance Briggs stripped Roethlisberger, and Julius Peppers returned the fumble 42 yards for a touchdown. Although the eventual extra point by Gould was blocked by Troy Polamalu, the Bears finished the game with Chris Conte intercepting Roethlisberger with 1:39 left in the game for the fifth takeaway by Chicago on the night and the 40-23 win, dropping the Steelers to 0-3 for the first time since 1986.\\n\\nHow many field goals were made in the first half?","target":"2","rationale":"To calculate how many field goals were made in the first half, we need to check who kicked when and where.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.","target":"Danny","rationale":"Hypercalcaemia refers to excessive levels of calcium in the blood, which can result from a variety of conditions.

The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Mohács in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz.

She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.","target":"No","rationale":"The question asks for the stage names of Joan Fontaine.

He needed to find causes of wildfires and suggest preventive measures. First, he visited a dense forest. He marked it as location A. Then he visited a grassland, which he marked as location B. After that, he visited a location where he did not find any sign of drought. He marked it as time A. He then visited the same location a year later, and found that the place was facing a severe drought. He marked it as time B.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWould time B see less or more wildfires than time A?\\n\\nHint: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from...","target":"more","rationale":"In this example, the question is asking whether there will be more or less wildfires during time B than in time A. The given context gives us information on conditions that affect wildfire occurrences e.g., when vegetation has low moisture content, it becomes flammable and can catch fire easily; dense forests are usually not susceptible to wildfires as they provide shade which results in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, but grasses and leaves have a higher susceptibility because they contain less water than denser materials such as branches and trunks.\\nBased on these facts about how forest density affects the occurrence of fires (under normal circumstances), we know that Location B - \\"a grassland\\" would experience fewer fires under Time A's conditions (\\"where he did not find any sign of drought\\") compared to Location A"},{"source":"Fossils can be used to match up rock layers.

To explain how the model handles compositional semantics of words and phrases, we study the hierarchical explanation problem. We highlight the key challenge is to compute non-additive and context-independent importance for individual words and phrases. We show some prior efforts on hierarchical explanations, e.g. contextual decomposition,  do not satisfy the desired properties mathematically, leading to inconsistent explanation quality in different models. In this paper, we propose a formal way to quantify the importance of each word or phrase to generate hierarchical explanations. We modify contextual decomposition algorithms according to our formulation, and propose a model-agnostic explanation algorithm with competitive performance. Human evaluation and automatic metrics evaluation on both LSTM models and fine-tuned BERT Transformer models on multiple datasets show that our algorithms robustly outperform prior works on hierarchical explanations. We show our algorithms help explain compositionality of semantics, extract classification rules, and improve human trust of models.","target":"We propose measurement of phrase importance and algorithms for hierarchical explanation of neural sequence model predictions","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose measurement of phrase importance and algorithms for hierarchical explanation of neural sequence model predictions."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a dialogue from a conversation between an agent and a customer.

Passage:Mother 3 was originally developed for the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) beginning in 1994. Shigeru Miyamoto, head of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and Mother 3 producer, said that Mother 3 was \\"a commercial decision\\", since Mother 2 (EarthBound outside Japan) had sold well. By this point, Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi had worked on the series' earlier games and Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 and was experienced at pitching video games, so Miyamoto provided a team willingly. The Mother 2 development team carried over to the new game's development, though several people left and the team grew in size. They forewent the usual prototyping phase and went straight into development expecting to create something unprecedented. Itoi said he wanted to make the game like a Hollywood film. In September 1994, he predicted that Mother 3 development would end around 1996 with a release on Nintendo's then-upcoming console. The team was inspired by Super Mario 64 and felt that they too could creatively flourish by making a 3D world without restrictions. Their early technical specifications exceeded the capabilities and memory limits of the platform. About halfway through development, the team attempted to scale back its large scope and changed its development platform to the 64DD, a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral. At E3 in June 1997, Miyamoto speculated that Mother 3 would be one of the four titles for the then-expected 1998 launch of the Japan-only peripheral, but the game was instead converted to a Nintendo 64 cartridge-only format upon the commercial failure of the repeatedly delayed 64DD.\\n Links: a.

We need to fill the 8 places in a row so that boys and girls alternate. There will be 8! = 40320 ways to arrange the 8 children in a row. However, all these arrangements are not valid because there will be some cases where at least 2 consecutive seats have children of same gender. Let's start with the worst case: if all the four boys sit together, then there is only one way to arrange them in a row (i.e BBBB). Similarly, if all four girls sit together then also there is only one way to arrange them (i.e GGGG). If we look at these two cases carefully we can see that both BBBB and GGGG take up 4 seats each so total we have taken up 8 seats out of available 8 which means remaining 0 seat for rest of the children - clearly it's not possible as we still have left 4 children (4G & 4B) who need to be seated on remaining 0 seat(s). So let's try another case: what if 3 Bs and 1 G sit together? Then there are 4! ways they can occupy their own positions giving us 24 arrangements but this is again not correct because when 3 Bs occupy their seats they leave 1 empty seat between themselves which means after ordering these 3Bs in a row (which took us 24 attempts) other 3Bs can't occupy any position until or unless they also get separated by placing another girl between them - but this would violate our given condition i.e \\"no two consecutive seats should contain people of same gender\\" making amount of seating arrangement equal to zero again! So let's try one more variation: what if 2 Bs & 2Gs sit together? This time around I added 2Gs with 2Bs instead of adding just 1G as I did earlier because you might wonder why didn't I add 1B along with those three Bs above since number of girls were less than number of boys i.e why did I added just 1 girl instead before adding fourth boy? That was due to availability issue - when you're given condition that no two consecutive people should have similar gender then first step you must follow is eliminate options where such condition already exist by default e.g here when we had just 3B &1G then even before doing permutation-combination calculation for finding total arrangement possibilities it was obvious that such configuration wouldn't work out without violating our give constraint so rather than wasting efforts on permutation-combination calculation involving such configurations better option was starting off from scratch by setting up configuration having equal number or greater number(in case number difference between genders were very high)of each gender type e .g here since initial setup had more males than females hence better strategy would've been starting off from scratch by setting configuraton having equal or greater female count compared with male count meaning either starting off from scratch by setting configuraton having 2 male &2 female or simply ignoring current setup altogether and moving ahead towards next stage as soon as possible without wasting much time/effort on combination/permutation calculation involving current configuration setup having more male counts compared against female counts which obviosuly won't work out anyway even before doing combination/permuation calculations !!! So anyway coming back towards main question now; how many combinations are possible using setting having two males ,two females ? The answer comes out as 12 combinations (this time around rather than trying each variation manually like previous approach let's use permuation formula itself right away ).So far previous approaches has resulted into total combination possibilities being equalto zero ie first approach gave us 24 variations while second approach gave us twelve variations but none worked out although both approaches used valid configurations satisfying given constraint criteria \\"no two adjacent people should belongto same group \\". Now question arise whether third attempt will result into successful outcome ? To find answer let review third attempt scenario : This time around rather thn going for seperating groups completely like previous attempts here we r going for situation where both groups partially overlap thus chances r higher that following this approch final outcome might turn up positive . SO anyways calculating total combinations based upon latest apporach results intototal 12*6=72 variation combinations . Combining results from all three approaches gives overall result \\n72+12+24=108 variations ...finishing touches involves combning 108 variations obtained previously with 144 reverse order variations thereby resultinginto overall 108+144=252 successful outcomes !"},{"source":"Does \\"Susan did not get an answer.\\" appear to be an accurate statement based on \\"Jane knocked on Susan's door but she did not get an answer.\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes","target":"no","rationale":"The passage tells us that Jane knocked on Susan's door, but we do not know whether or not she received an answer.

The family moved often before finally settling in Winchester, Virginia when Patsy was 16. Sam Hensley deserted his family in 1947, but the children's home was reportedly happy nonetheless.  When Patsy was 13, she was hospitalized with a throat infection and rheumatic fever.

Under Edward VI, the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I; even so two radicals were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying Christ's divinity). Under Mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction. When Elizabeth I came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of \\"...a subversive fifth column.\\" The last execution of a \\"heretic\\" in England occurred under James VI and I in 1612.

POST :  \\n\\n  \\nTo  add some background: I am taking a gap year off from school, so I don't  flunk out. I have Major Depressive Disorder and generalized anxiety  disorder, which seriously affected my education. To become a better  adult and not be so dependent upon my mother, I moved in with my father  in a different state.  \\nMy entire life I was raised by only my mom. I  have three younger half sisters, we all have the same father. I visited  my dad when I was younger, but I had such horrible times visiting him,  that I decided that I never wanted to stay with him for a long period of  time ever again. My mom didn't force me to go, so I wouldn't raise an  unholy stink about it.  \\nFast forward about ten years later, I am now  22 and living with my dad, with my cat, for at least a year, I have a  job and I pay for the internet bill and I take care of my cat.  \\nAbout a  week into my stay in my dad's house we were sitting and watching a  movie in the living room and my dad tells me he might have another  daughter that is older than me. Since I didn't grow up with him, this  hasn't really affected me, but the second daughter (or maybe third) was  really hurt by this revelation, which was told to them by a third party  after Christmas, I wasn't told until around the end of the first week of  January. The second daughter won't accept this possible daughter until  an DNA test is done, but neither her nor my dad are going to get that  done for various reasons, most of which I don't know.  \\nI was really  happy he was telling me this as, i thought he was opening up to me. He  also said that he didn't really like my mother because she never told  him things, like my sexuality. In her defence, I didn't outright tell  her until around November of last year, so she didn't know much longer  than he did. Or that I was molested by another child, once again, in her  defence, I didn't tell her until eight years after the fact, and it  only came up because I told my therapist thought I feel better if she  knew, it sort of helped. I didn't tell my dad until during my second  hospital stay for suicidal ideation last March. Or the fact that he made  me hug his mom while she was naked during one of my visits was one of  the many reasons I never wanted to visit him for more than a few hours  again. He says he didn't make me do that, and I will admit that my  memory is spotty over those two long trips, but I'm pretty sure it was  him that did that.  \\nAnyway, after that long talk I hugged and kissed  him goodnight, but I smelled alcohol on his breath and realized that he  had been drinking. I started my new job, which was very tiring, but I  was making an effort to spend more time with my father, but it seemed  like he was avoiding me, which actually really hurt me. I bought dinner  and, normally he eats in the living room, but this time he took the food  upstairs and ate. I kind of assumed that he was embarrassed by what he  was saying while slightly under the influence. He comes downstairs the  next day and I felt like I was being fussed at for my room being messy,  sometime while I was out of my room, my threw up on the floor. I felt  like he was threatening her being able to stay here and I will admit  that made me defensive, seeing as that was the first thing in days he  said more than two words to me. I cleaned up my room that night.  \\nI  vented to my mom about the last few days, and she got upset on my behalf  and texted my dad, I don't know exactly what was said, but it prompted  my dad to call her and needless to say, the conversation did not go  well. We were facetiming and my mom muted herself and I saw, but didn't  hear the conversation. I felt like an asshole for basically causing a  fight between them and wished I could take back what I said. My dad  called me, but I had to go to work and wouldn't be back until around  10:30pm. I basically had an anxiety attack before I left and cried, but I  got through my shift came back and fell asleep.  \\nThe next day I get  off of work at around 5pm, my gets off around that time as well and I  got my food and was going back upstairs when my dad stopped me and said  after I was done eating to come back down so we could talk. This caused  another anxiety attack, so I called my mom up, she has been the one I go  to my entire life, and she says to stop stalling and go down there and  talk.   \\nThe talk was me listening and him talking. I did say that I  felt like was threatening my cat being here and he said that that wasn't  the case. I said okay, I understood.  \\nHe proceeds to say that he  shouldn't be getting any texts from my mom about how he is handling me,  which he is right about, and that my mom has basically gotten me used to  living in a messy room and he won't allow it. I think he is under the  misconception that my mom said bad things about him while I was growing  up, even though she didn't. In fact she was the one who encouraged me to  talk with him more, but back to the talk, he says that it wasn't true  that he said that he didn't really like my mom, which made me feel like a  liar because he definitely said that. He also said that I can ask my  sisters and his wife about what type of person he is, even though during  the long talk that night he said he was easy to get along with.  \\nHe  ended the conversation with saying that if I continue to talk with my  mom about what goes on in this house we will probably never be close. I  said okay and hugged him goodnight. I told my mom to never talk to my  dad again and that I don't want to cause another fight between them.  \\nSince  then, we haven't really talked at all, no more than hellos and  goodbyes. I loathe confrontation, but I'm not going to stop talking to  my mom, for 22 years she has been all that I have had.

Rookie running back Ricky Ervins was also a major asset to the running attack, rushing 145 times for 680 yards for an average of 4.7 yards per carry, while also catching 16 passes for 181 yards. And when Washington was near the goal line, they usually relied on fullback Gerald Riggs, who rushed for 248 yards and scored 11 touchdowns. The Redskins offensive line, known as \\"The Hogs (American football)\\", was led by Pro Bowl tackle Jim Lachey and guard Mark Schlereth, along with four-time Pro Bowl veteran Russ Grimm. The Hogs allowed the fewest sacks in the league with just 9, 10 sacks less than the team that allowed the second-fewest. Even Washingtons special teams unit was a big threat.

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a $100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a $250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T.

In the most general case, polarization is elliptical, meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time. Two special cases are linear polarization (the ellipse collapses into a line) as we have discussed above, and circular polarization (in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal). In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation. Circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as right-handed or left-handed using the \\"thumb in the direction of the propagation\\" rule.

Boeing designed the 747 's hump - like upper deck to serve as a first class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door .

Infected cells produced 50 to 8000 progeny virus particles, but these differences were lost upon subsequent culture, suggesting the diversity of yields reflected cell-to-cell differences rather than viral genetic variation. Cells infected at different phases of their cell cycle produced from 1400 (early S) to 8700 (G 2 M) infectious virus particles, coinciding with the middle-to-upper range of the observed distribution.

A decade later, as a 28-year-old, at the IBSF World 6-Red World Snooker Championship in Sharm-El-Sheik, Egypt, he won one of the amateur world titles (on debut in the short format).  As a new player on the tour, Advani would need to win four matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events. He did this in just his fourth attempt, when qualifying for the International Championship. He defeated Craig Steadman 6-1, six-time world champion Steve Davis 6-5 (after being 1-4 down), Alan McManus 6-3 and Michael Holt 6-4 to reach the venue stage for the first time. He made four century breaks during qualification, the most of any player. Advani was to play a wildcard match once at the tournament in Chengdu, China, to reach the last 32, however he decided to withdraw from the tournament to take part in the World Billiards Championship, which he went on to win. He also reached the semi-finals of the minor ranking European Tour Event 1, beating four-time world champion John Higgins 4-1 along the way. Advani lost to Mark Selby 2-4. Advani played in eight of the ten of these Players Tour Championship events and finished 40th on the Order of Merit.  At the 2013 Welsh Open, he became the first Indian player to reach the quarter-final stage of a ranking event with a 4-1 win over Graeme Dott in the last 16, but lost 2-5 to Judd Trump.

In the Flavescens-Group-cultivars, the leaf stalks are large and are often prepared separately from the leaf blade. The leaf blade can be green or reddish in color; the leaf stalks also vary in color, usually white, yellow, or red. Chard has highly nutritious leaves making it a popular addition to healthful diets (like other green leafy vegetables). Chard has been around for centuries, but because of its similarity to other beets and some other vegetables such as cardoon, the common names used by cooks over the centuries may be confusing.\\n\\n- Beta vulgaris (beet) is a plant which is included in Betoideae subfamily in the Amaranthaceae family. It is the economically most important crop of the large order Caryophyllales. It has several cultivar groups, the sugar beet, of greatest importance to produce table sugar; the root vegetable known as the beetroot or garden beet; the leaf vegetables chard and spinach beet; and mangelwurzel, which is a fodder crop.

They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides.

Fossella, a Staten Island native, was born to a family that included several politicians. Fossella initially took office in 1997, after winning a special election held to replace the resigning Susan Molinari. As a result of a DUI arrest in Alexandria, Virginia on May 1, 2008, followed by the public disclosure a week later that he had had an affair with Laura Fay, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel, that had resulted in a three-year-old child while Fossella was married, he announced on his official website on May 20 that he had chosen to serve out the remainder of his term, which ended on January 3, 2009, but decided not to run for re-election.\\n\\nFossella was born on Staten Island into a Roman Catholic family of Irish and Italian descent.

One of his uncles, Frank Fossella, was a prominent Staten Island Democrat who was a City Council member for four years, ending in 1985. His father, Vito John Fossella Sr., served in various appointed positions in the city administrations of Democratic Mayors Edward I. Koch and Abraham D. Beame, then became a successful construction engineer.  Fossella, the fourth of seven children, was a basketball player at Monsignor Farrell High School, where he got his first political experience in the student council. He briefly played violin and percussion with the Christian pop band Sonseed. He attended Iona College in New Rochelle, then transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 1987. At Penn, he was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.  After college, Fossella worked as a management consultant at the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was the second largest campaign contributor to Fossella in the 2006 campaign cycle and among the largest contributors in the 2008 campaign cycle.  Fossella then attended law school. He received a Juris Doctor from the Fordham University School of Law in 1993, and worked as an associate at a medical malpractice defense law firm Schiavetti Begos & Nicholson.

In standard SGD, parameters are updated by improving along the path of the gradient at the current iterate on a batch of examples, where the addition of a \`\`momentum'' term biases the update in the direction of the previous change in parameters. In non-stochastic convex optimization one can show that a momentum adjustment provably reduces convergence time in many settings, yet such results have been elusive in the stochastic and non-convex settings. At the same time, a widely-observed empirical phenomenon is that in training deep networks stochastic momentum appears to significantly improve convergence time, variants of it have flourished in the development of other popular update methods, e.g. ADAM, AMSGrad, etc. Yet theoretical justification for the use of stochastic momentum has remained a significant open question. In this paper we propose an answer: stochastic momentum improves deep network training because it modifies SGD to escape saddle points faster and, consequently, to more quickly find a second order stationary point. Our theoretical results also shed light on the related question of how to choose the ideal momentum parameter--our analysis suggests that $\\\\beta \\\\in [0,1)$ should be large (close to 1), which comports with empirical findings.

Knox admonished that the United States would not resume diplomatic relations with Nicaragua until Madriz demonstrated that his was a \\"responsible government ... prepared to make reparations for the wrongs\\" done to American citizens. His request for asylum granted by Mexico, Zelaya was escorted by armed guard to the Mexican gunboat General Guerrero and departed Corinto for Salina Cruz, Mexico, on the night of December 23, with Albany standing by but taking no action. As the flagship of the Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron, under Admiral William W.

By mid-March 1909, the insurgency led by Estrada and Chamorro was seemingly collapsed and with the apparent and unexpected strength of Madriz, the U.S. Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron completed its withdrawal from Nicaraguan waters.

If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Greg is is a chef.

Founded in 1701 in Saybrook Colony to train Congregationalist ministers, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States.\\n\\n- Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze ( 18 January 1963 -- 30 December 2007 ) was a Nigerian - born American philosopher . Eze was a specialist in postcolonial philosophy . He wrote as well as edited influential postcolonial histories of philosophy in Africa , Europe , and the Americas . Influences in his own work include Paulin Hountondji , Richard Rorty , David Hume , and Immanuel Kant . Eze was most recently Associate Professor of Philosophy at DePaul University , where he also edited the journal Philosophia Africana . He died on December 30 , 2007 in Lewisburg , Pennsylvania after a short illness .\\n\\n- Analytic philosophy (sometimes analytical philosophy) is a style of philosophy that became dominant in English-speaking countries at the beginning of the 20th century. In the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Scandinavia, the majority of university philosophy departments today identify themselves as \\"analytic\\" departments. \\n\\n- Richard McKay Rorty (October 4, 1931  June 8, 2007) was an American philosopher. Educated at the University of Chicago and Yale University, he had strong interests and training in both the history of philosophy and contemporary analytic philosophy, the latter of which came to comprise the main focus of his work at Princeton University in the 1960s. He subsequently came to reject the tradition of philosophy according to which knowledge involves correct representation (a \\"mirror of nature\\") of a world whose existence remains wholly independent of that representation. Rorty had a long and diverse academic career, including positions as Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University, Kenan Professor of Humanities at the University of Virginia, and Professor of Comparative Literature at Stanford University. Among his most influential books are \\"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\\" (1979), \\"Consequences of Pragmatism\\" (1982), and \\"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\\" (1989).\\n\\n- Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its campus is one of the largest in the United States. Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.\\n\\n- A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it. Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Although \\"historian\\" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians, though, are recognized by publications or training and experience. \\"Historian\\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere.\\n\\n- Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity is a 1989 book by the American philosopher Richard Rorty, based on two sets of lectures he gave at University College, London and at Trinity College, Cambridge. In contrast to his earlier work, \\"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\\" (1979), Rorty mostly abandons attempts to explain his theories in analytical terms and instead creates an alternate conceptual schema to that of the \\"Platonists\\" he rejects. In this schema \\"truth\\" (as the term is used conventionally) is considered unintelligible and meaningless.\\n\\n- India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.\\n\\n- Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.\\n\\n- The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.\\n\\n- Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\\n\\n- Classical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is a term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and Southwestern Asia.\\n\\n- The University of Virginia (U.Va. or UVA), frequently referred to simply as Virginia, is a public flagship and research university. Founded in 1819 by Declaration of Independence author Thomas Jefferson, UVA is known for its historic foundations, student-run honor code, and secret societies.\\n\\n- Princeton University is a private Ivy League research university in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.\\n\\n- The University of Chicago (U of C, Chicago, or UChicago) is a private research university in Chicago, Illinois. It is one of the world's leading and most influential institutions of higher learning, with top-ten positions in numerous rankings and measures.\\n\\n- David Hume (born David Home; 7 May 1711 NS  25 August 1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist, who is best known today for his highly influential system of radical philosophical empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism.\\n\\n- Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ;  in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild.

The lineup of the band remained constant until the departure of Rafferty in 2008.\\n\\nOn November 21 2016, the Kooks announced a 'Best Of' UK Tour to take place in April and May 2017 to mark their tenth anniversary as a band, in which they were planning to perform hits, b-sides and brand new music. To coincide with the tour, on March 31 2017 the band announced the upcoming release of The Best of... So Far, as well as releasing \\"Be Who You Are\\", one of two new songs included on the compilation. Pritchard stressed that this compilation and tour did not signal the end of the band, stating, \\"It's been the greatest pleasure to work, travel, fight, hate and love the best and most talented people I've met in my life. It's the greatest job in the world and we don't intend to stop any time soon.\\"  The two new tracks were produced by Brandon Friesen, who has also been overseeing sessions for the band's next studio album.

It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift  about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20.\\nCaesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days.\\nIn 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \\"00\\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400.

Methods: We evaluated survivors with confirmed SARS at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, at 3, 6, and 12 months after symptom onset. Our assessment included: lung volume (total lung capacity [TLC], vital capacity, residual volume, functional residual capacity), spirometry (FVC, FEV 1 ), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle strength, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), chest radiographs (CXRs), and HRQoL by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey questionnaire. Results: Ninety-seven patients completed the serial assessments. There were 39 male and 58 female patients, and 63 patients (70%) were health-care workers (mean age, 36.9 years [SD, 9.5 years]; body mass index, 23.7 kg/m 2 [SD, 4.0 kg/m 2 ]). At 1 year, 27 patients (27.8%) had abnormal CXR findings. Four patients (4.1%), 5 patients (5.2%), and 23 patients (23.7%) had FVC, TLC, and DLCO values < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The 6MWD at 12 months was 511.0 m (SD, 89.8 m), which was higher than at 3 months (mean difference, 47.0 m; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.8 to 62.1 m; p < 0.01) but not different from 6 months (mean difference, 9.7 m; 95% CI, ؊ 4.4 to 23.8 m; p ‫؍‬ 0.18). The 6MWD was lower than that for normal control subjects of the same age groups, and there was impairment of HRQoL at 12 months. Patients who required ICU admission (n ‫؍‬ 31) showed higher CXR scores (1.6 [SD, 3.1]; vs 0.4 [SD, 1.1]; p ‫؍‬ 0.04) and lower percentage of predicted FVC, TLC, and DLCO than those who did not, but there were no differences in 6MWD and health status. Conclusion: Significant impairment in DLCO was noted in 23.7% of survivors 1 year after illness onset. Exercise capacity and health status of SARS survivors were remarkably lower than those of a normal population.

To reduce antimicrobial use and resistance on dairy farms, research on alternative therapies for calf diarrhea is necessary. Our laboratory previously conducted a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein found in colostrum, as a treatment for calf diarrhea. The trial showed significantly reduced calf mortality in diarrheic calves that were administered lactoferrin. Thus, the objective of this study was to corroborate the results of our prior clinical trial across multiple farms and to investigate the effect of lactoferrin on the morbidity and mortality of preweaned calves with naturally occurring cases of diarrhea. This randomized field trial was conducted on 5 commercial dairy farms in Ohio. In total, 485 calves (≤21 d of age) were enrolled at first diarrhea diagnosis (fecal score ≥2 defined as loose to watery) and randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of lactoferrin (3 g of lactoferrin powder dissolved in 30 mL of water) or 30 mL of water (control) once daily for 3 consecutive days. Health assessments were conducted on the day of diarrhea diagnosis (d 0) and 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d following diagnosis. Producer records of disease treatment and mortality were collected 120 d following diagnosis. A Poisson regression model was used to test differences between treatments in disease frequency through 35 d post-diarrhea diagnosis and the incidence risk of treatment and mortality risk 120 d post-diarrhea diagnosis; the model controlled for calf age at enrollment, farm, and treatment. Median calf age at enrollment was 11 d and ranged from 1 to 26 d of age. At study enrollment, 51.3% (123/240) and 52.2% (128/245) of calves in the control and lactoferrin treatment groups, respectively, were diagnosed with severe diarrhea (fecal score = 3). The frequency of disease (diarrhea, dehydration, depression, signs of respiratory disease) through 35 d following diarrhea diagnosis was not significantly different for calves in the lactoferrin and control groups. Overall mortality risk for enrolled calves was 9.9%, and 10.7% (22/243) and 9.1% (26/242) of calves in the lactoferrin and control groups, respectively, died or were culled in the 120 d following diarrhea diagnosis. The relative risk of death or culling did not differ between treatment groups, however. Therefore, as performed in this study, lactoferrin as a treatment for calf diarrhea was not beneficial.","target":"A multisite, randomized field trial to evaluate the influence of lactoferrin on the morbidity and mortality of dairy calves with diarrhea","rationale":"The title should describe the purpose of the study and summarize the main findings.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\\n\\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : I'm gay and around March last year began getting close with a bisexual friend of mine. By 'close' I mean platonically so. I did have feelings for him but he didn't feel the same way. We spent a lot of time together, spoke a lot, and seemed to think very highly of each other. \\n\\nI got a big red flag when he tried to make out with me at a party we were both at. This wasn't uncommon behaviour for him, but I took issue with it being directed at me. I forgave him -- he was drunk, after all -- but asked him not to do it again because it was messing with my feelings a little bit. He tried it twice more on two separate occasions before I finally decided I needed some space to deal with my feelings properly. The decision to distance myself was a complicated one; I knew our mutual friends were fed up with him and were on the brink of ditching him, but at the same time I felt suffocated in the relationship and wanted that to end. The problem was that he would be completely alone (he didn't have much of a family at the time) and I didn't want that for him. Nonetheless, I chose to distance myself anyway and made it clear why. I thought that the least helpful thing would be to freeze him out without explanation and that knowing would perhaps make things easier to process. \\n\\nThis lasted for a week. It turned out we were, once again, both present at the same house party. I avoided talking to him and generally stuck to chatting with random people and seeing how it went. Little did I know he was going to try to hang himself in the home-owners garage, or at least that is what it looked like. After seeing him stumble in there, I figured I ought to check on him because I knew there were loads of dangerous tools in rather precarious places and he might knock something over and hurt himself or something. Well, I caught him as I did and we ended up having a long -- rather touchy, on his side of things -- conversation about what was going on. He blamed me for all of it and told me that it was because I'd made him feel guilty. He explained that he loved me, that things could be different if he wasn't afraid of his sexuality, and how he wanted me to promise I wouldn't leave him. Foolishly, I made that promise, if only because I wanted it to make him feel better.\\n\\nThe next day I spoke to him about it because I couldn't really sleep after seeing him all strung up like that. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help. He said no, but that he would consider the account of everything I'd told him and get back to me. In spite of saying very little about anything else, he told me to discount what he said about loving me. At this point, I just rolled my eyes and waited patiently for a reply that I didn't get. Instead, I heard three different versions of that same story from our mutual friends all over the course of the next month, all which painted me in a bad light. I began to wonder if there was something terrible I'd done but deluded myself into thinking I hadn't. This time I was a little more direct and asked him about it straight up. He then admitted that he was self-harming and blamed it on me, again. From that point onwards I have had recurrent dreams about it and have not been able to absolve my guilt for something which, I can reason now, was not my responsibility. Our mutual friends speculated that he was self-harming, based on something they'd noticed, and I confirmed it for them hoping they'd treat him a little better.\\n\\nA week later all of our mutual friends had ditched him, and to this day I don't really know why. I can make some educated guesses, but I've never heard any proper explanations. Either way, I thought it was unfair for them to ditch him despite knowing what they did. This meant that I was the only person he really had any more, which wasn't great for me but I accepted that and tried to help. I stayed up night after night to keep him company and, combining that with the guilt of what he'd accused me of, I became very depressed. I gradually isolated myself from everybody but him and neglected the advice of all the friends who told me to stop helping him. I wasn't going to, though, because they were unwilling to give him a second chance and he'd still be all alone. \\n\\nSuddenly he froze me out and started trying very hard to get back in with these mutual friends again. My poor judgement in isolating myself meant that it was now I who had nobody I was particularly close to anymore and, having become rather unpersonable and irritable in person, nobody was particularly interested in my company. Most of all, I felt betrayed. I'd tried to help him the best I could and after all they'd done to him he was in the process of ditching me in favour of them. I spoke to him about it and he called me selfish for talking about my feelings. I warned him about them -- they'd not only hurt him but countless people in the past, and I think they're pretty callous -- to which he accused me of attempting to manipulate him because, apparently, I wanted control over him. It was at this point I learned that he'd turned to drugs to cope. I told an official trained in pastoral support because I was no longer in a position to help at all and I didn't want to see him running himself into the ground like that. I know it has helped him in the long-run, and it has also meant that his family are looking out for him a lot more now and making sure they're present in his life.\\n\\nWe argued at this point more than we talked normally. I often got angry and was generally scathing to him in these instances, and he'd accuse me of doing all sorts of heinous things that I wouldn't even dream of doing. Depression worsened and my feelings for him hadn't gone, neither had the guilt or the dreams, and any attempt to talk to him about any of this he took severe issue with. On one occasion I lashed out verbally and, I'm told, really hurt him. I remember that I was not pleasant whatsoever and I take responsibility for that. After this, he nearly hit me at another house party and I decided I'd had enough. He ended up in with our mutual 'friends' -- who, at this point, had ditched me -- and I wondered if I'd been so unreasonably terrible that this was what I deserved. I decided to go see a counsellor from this point onwards.\\n\\nI hadn't spoken to him in four months and have only recently been in contact with him again. The dreams haven't gone and neither has the guilt, and I've asked him if I can talk to him about it. I understand it might be hard for him to talk about all of that stuff, but I feel that if I can reconcile what happened and understand my place in it all I might be able to sleep properly again. Having asked him, he refused on the basis that I'd try to manipulate him again (not that I see where I did this in the first place) and try to turn him against his friends. I pushed for it and he's finally agreed. I'm asking here if I'm the arsehole in this situation because my current friends all become very shifty when I ask them for advice. I don't want to push him, but I'm at a point in my life where I can't afford to be losing sleep over something I think can be ended like this. \\n\\nThanks in advance.","target":"no","rationale":"The author of this post, who is also the main character in the story they tell, appears to have acted ethically.

Surprisingly, microarray based identification of food-borne viruses, one of the largest groups of pathogenic viruses, causing more than 1.5 billion infections world-wide every year, has lagged behind. Cell-culture techniques are either unavailable or time consuming for routine application. Consequently, current detection methods for these pathogens largely depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, generally requiring an investigator to preselect the target virus of interest. Here we describe the first attempt to use the microarray as an identification tool for these viruses. We have developed methodology to synthesize targets for virus identification without using PCR, making the process genuinely sequence independent. We show here that a tiling microarray can simultaneously detect and identify the genotype and strain of common food-borne viruses in a single experiment. \\n Title: Detection and Identification of Common Food-Borne Viruses with a Tiling Microarray","target":"True","rationale":"The title accurately describes the main purpose of the research described in the paragraph.

That season, he equalled the Coventry City record for most goals in a top division season with 23 goals in all competitions.  Following Phil Neal's departure in 1995, the arrival of Ron Atkinson and Gordon Strachan would see Dublin fit into an attacking team in the typical Atkinson mould. It included the likes of Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby to add to the already attack minded Peter Ndlovu. The addition of Gary McAllister, following Euro 96, should have provided mid table stability but the teams defensive frailties often undermined Dublin's scoring at the other end. This culminated in possibly one of the greatest escapes in Premiership history in May 1997. Sitting second from bottom, Coventry City needed favourable results elsewhere whilst needing an away win at White Hart Lane. This game followed on from an away win at Anfield (Dublin scoring in the dying seconds) and a home win against Chelsea. But at Tottenham Hotspur that afternoon, Dublin scored in the first half before Paul Williams netted to secure an unlikely 2-1 win. The game reached a nerve-racking climax which included a memorable late save from City keeper Steve Ogrizovic.  The following season the Sky Blues improved at home and enjoyed a season of mid table security. Dublin formed an impressive partnership with Darren Huckerby which not only produced some memorable goals but also propelled the Sky Blues to the FA Cup Sixth Round against Sheffield United; a game they narrowly lost in a penalty shoot out. The 1997-98 season also saw Dublin share elite status as the Premier League's top scorer with Blackburn's Chris Sutton and Liverpool's Michael Owen - each Englishman scoring 18 league goals. During this season, Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson tabled a bid which Dublin rejected. He remained at Highfield Road and contributed to Coventry's best finish to date in the Premiership (11th).\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"How long did Dion Dublin play in Coventry City?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"four-and-a-half years","rationale":"The first sentence of the text states that Dion Dublin played for Coventry City for \\"four-and-a-half years\\", making it clear that this is the answer to the question."},{"source":"Read the given text and if it has abusive content then indicate via \\"yes\\".

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.\\n\\nParagraph: There are two neighboring towns that were founded around the same time as one another.

They come out to our company's happy hours, holiday parties, etc. Even though I've been at the company longer than a lot of the people inviting their spouses, not many people coming on the trip have ever met my spouse.

They are found through much of North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and North Africa, occurring in mountains over most of the range. Firs are most closely related to the genus \\"Cedrus\\" (cedar). Douglas firs are not true firs, being of the genus \\"Pseudotsuga\\".\\n\\n- In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.\\n\\n- Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America.

Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.\\n\\n- Pine squirrels are squirrels of the genus Tamiasciurus, in the Sciurini tribe, of the large family Sciuridae.\\n\\n- The Douglas squirrel (\\"Tamiasciurus douglasii\\") is a pine squirrel found in the Pacific coastal states and provinces of North America. It is sometimes known as the chickaree or pine squirrel, although these names are also used for the American red squirrel. Variant spellings of the common name are Douglas' squirrel and Douglas's squirrel. The Native Americans of Kings River called it the \\"Pillillooeet\\", in imitation of its characteristic alarm call.\\n\\n- In botany, an evergreen is a plant that has leaves throughout the year, always green. This contrasts with deciduous plants, which completely lose their foliage during the winter or dry season. There are many different kinds of evergreen plants, both trees and shrubs. Evergreens include:\\n\\n- The genus Sciurus contains most of the common, bushy-tailed squirrels in North America, Europe, temperate Asia, Central America and South America. \\n\\n- An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.\\n\\n- Monterrey, is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo León, in Mexico. The city is anchor to the third-largest metropolitan area in Mexico and is ranked as the ninth-largest city in the nation. Monterrey serves as a commercial center in the north of the country and is the base of many significant international corporations.\\n\\n- Cedrus (common name cedar) is a genus of coniferous trees in the plant family Pinaceae. They are native to the mountains of the western Himalayas and the Mediterranean region, occurring at altitudes of 1,5003,200 m in the Himalayas and 1,0002,200 m in the Mediterranean.\\n\\n- The American red squirrel (\\"Tamiasciurus hudsonicus\\") is one of three species of tree squirrel currently classified in the genus \\"Tamiasciurus\\", known as the pine squirrels (the others are the Douglas squirrel, \\"T. douglasii\\" and Mearns's squirrel, \\"T. mearnsi\\"). American red squirrels are also referred to as pine squirrels, North American red squirrels, boomers, and chickarees. They are medium-sized (200250 g) diurnal mammals that defend a year-round exclusive territory. The diet of these tree squirrels is specialized on the seeds of conifer cones. As such, they are widely distributed across North America wherever conifers are common, except on the Pacific coast, where they are replaced by Douglas squirrels. Recently, American red squirrels have been expanding their range to include primarily hardwood areas.\\n\\n- Tree squirrels are the members of the squirrel family (Sciuridae) most commonly referred to as \\"squirrels\\". They include over a hundred primarily tree-dwelling species, native to all continents except Antarctica and Australia. They do not form a single natural, or monophyletic, group, but instead are related to the various other animals in the squirrel family, including ground squirrels, flying squirrels, marmots, and chipmunks. The defining characteristic that is used to determine which of the various species of Sciuridae are tree squirrels is therefore not so dependent on their physiology, but their habitat. Tree squirrels live mostly among trees, as opposed to other squirrels that live in burrows in the ground or among rocks. However, there is one exception to this rule, as physiological distinction does make a difference in regard to flying squirrels, who also make their home in trees, but have unique physical characteristics that separate them from their tree squirrel cousins (specifically, special flaps of skin that act as glider wings, allowing them to \\"fly\\").\\n\\n- Pseudotsuga is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Pinaceae. Common names include Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, Douglas tree, and Oregon pine. \\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\\" is widespread in western North America and is an important source of timber. The number of species has long been debated, but two in western North America and two to four in eastern Asia are commonly acknowledged. Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas-firs, due to the species' similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in \\"Pinus\\", \\"Picea\\", \\"Abies\\", \\"Tsuga\\", and even \\"Sequoia\\". Because of their distinctive cones, Douglas-firs were finally placed in the new genus \\"Pseudotsuga\\" (meaning \\"false hemlock\\") by the French botanist Carrière in 1867. The genus name has also been hyphenated as \\"Pseudo-tsuga\\".\\n\\n- The Pinaceae (pine family) are trees or shrubs, including many of the well-known conifers of commercial importance such as cedars, firs, hemlocks, larches, pines and spruces. The family is included in the order Pinales, formerly known as Coniferales. Pinaceae are supported as monophyletic by their protein-type sieve cell plastids, pattern of proembryogeny, and lack of bioflavonoids. They are the largest extant conifer family in species diversity, with between 220 and 250 species (depending on taxonomic opinion) in 11 genera, and the second-largest (after Cupressaceae) in geographical range, found in most of the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority of the species in temperate climates, but ranging from subarctic to tropical. The family often forms the dominant component of boreal, coastal, and montane forests. One species, \\"Pinus merkusii\\", grows just south of the equator in Southeast Asia. Major centres of diversity are found in the mountains of southwest China, Mexico, central Japan, and California.\\n\\n- Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.\\n\\n- Pseudotsuga menziesii, commonly known as Douglas fir or Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer species native to western North America.\\n\\n- Mearns 's squirrel ( Tamiasciurus mearnsi ) is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae . It is endemic to pine and fir forests at altitudes of 2,100 -- 2,400 metres ( 6,900 -- 7,900 ft ) in central Baja California in Mexico . This endangered species occurs in low densities and is threatened by habitat loss . It is possibly also threatened by competition from the eastern gray squirrel , which was introduced to the range of Mearns 's squirrel in 1946 , but may not be present anymore . Mearns 's squirrel is closely related to the Douglas squirrel , but far less is known about its behavior , which was first studied in detail in 2004 - 2005 .\\n\\n- Sciurus carolinensis, common name eastern gray squirrel or grey squirrel depending on region, is a tree squirrel in the genus \\"Sciurus\\".

Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one's free time digging, planting, watering and doing other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has the reward of one who has shared the secret of Nature.\\nSome people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants.

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\".\\n\\nOkay, for some context, we are both in High school. A few years ago, when we were 13, we were “dating” aka hanging out together after school and during weekends. After three months of our relationship, we shared our first kiss and it all went downhill from there. \\n\\nAfter our first kiss, he started wanting things from me, specifically sexual favors. He would constantly ask me for a blowjob and I would always refuse. Eventually, he would start pulling his dick out and making me touch it and pleading me to suck it. I was VERY uncomfortable with this, and he managed to convince me that I was a bad girlfriend for refusing to blow him.\\n\\nHe would also constantly try to touch me, but most of the time, I gave the excuse that I hadn’t shaved down there and he would leave it be. Once though, I did shave before hand, because for some reason, I thought I would be ready. When he came over that day, I realized I wasn’t and told him not to. He shoved his hand down my pants anyway. As. I. Told. Him. No.\\nI remember pulling his hand out of my jeans and him brushing it off and smelling his fingers to tell me that I smelt good. I don’t remember what any of the other encounters were that day, just that specific memory.\\n\\nI was really starting to get into feminism at this point, and joined my junior high’s gay straight alliance. We had this event called the GLSEN Day of Silence where students were supposed to wear black and pledge an oath of silence for the day to protest against bullying and harassment of lgbt+ students. People would ask why I was joining and I wrote down a cute pie chart of how much I felt I was attracted to boys vs. girls and a title that said “I’m Bisexual! :)”.\\n\\nThis was my first time coming out to any of my friends, and it was the first time I told my Ex. He read the note, looked up at me, read the note again, and then with the face of Joseph when Mary first told him she was pregnant, he said “You’re bi?”.\\n\\nWe had an argument over FB messenger on the way home from school. He told me he couldn’t date a bi girl because I was more likely to cheat on him. That’s when we broke up.\\n\\nOver the summer, I met someone new and started a long distance relationship with said person. I was happy with him... then the flashbacks came. I don’t know why, but that memory of my ex shoving his hand down my pants started to constantly play, and I would panic attacks over it. Luckily, my new bf was supportive when I told him what happened and would even call when I’d have panic attacks so I could calm down. \\n\\n I didn’t tell my parents that it even happened until a year after my ex and I broke up. At the end of 8th grade, I told all of my friends what happened and many took my side (but some still hung out with him afterwards)\\n\\nRight before Freshman year, I contacted him on social media and we had a nice conversation. He apologized for what he did to me and promised that he would never do that to another girl again.\\n\\nAnyway, here we are present day.\\nLast night, a girl contacted me (Let’s call her A) and told me that her BFF (B) is dating my ex, and she wanted to know if that was the same Ex that had sexually assaulted me. I told her yes, then proceeded to answer any questions she had, as well as tell her my full story.  \\nA tells me that B has admitted that my ex does sexual things to her without her consent but she is “okay with it” (A thinks she’s lying). A said that she gets a really bad vibe from my ex, and that she thinks that he may be doing similar things to B.\\n\\nThat makes my blood boil and want to confront this girl and tell her to break up with him as soon as she can because I don’t want another girl to go through the same trauma that I did!\\nBut at the same time, what happened to me happened when we were technically kids, and I don’t feel like it’s my lane to sabotage his relationships. I fear that it will make me seem jealous and I’ll be known as his “crazy ex”\\nIdk, should I talk to B? Should I let her know of the monster that her boyfriend was when we were together? Have I slandered his name enough just by telling our friends about what he did to me? Am I an asshole for not putting the whole thing aside  and moving on with my life? \\n\\n\\nTDRL: My “ex boyfriend” sexually assaulted me when we were 13 and now we’re in HS and I suspect that he’s doing the same to another girl even though he told me he wouldn’t. I told our friends about him and part of me feels like I slandered his name enough but the other part of me wants to protect other girls from him.","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning if it was appropriate to tell her friend that her boyfriend is doing similar things to her as he did with the author.\\nIn the post, the author uses the past tense to describe what happened between them when they were 13 and describes an event that occurred recently in which she talked with a friend about it. The author does not explicitly state when this recent event occurred, but she mentions that they are currently in high school which suggests that both events have already occurred.\\nBased on this analysis, it seems like both events have already occurred, so this anecdote is not hypothetical. In addition, acting ethically means being responsible and making decisions based on your moral values and beliefs. By choosing to share what had happened between herself and her ex-boyfriend with their mutual friends (and presumably their other friends as well), she acted ethically by warning others about him so that he wouldn't hurt anyone else again (as he stated he would not).

The history of the development of oral contraceptives is thus closely tied to the birth control movement and the efforts of activists Margaret Sanger, Mary Dennett, and Emma Goldman. Based on fundamental research performed by Gregory Pincus and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by Carl Djerassi at Syntex and by Frank Colton at G.D. Searle & Co., the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was developed by E.D. Searle and Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960. The original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones, and caused severe side effects. Nonetheless, by 1962, 1.2 million American women were on the pill, and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million. The availability of a convenient form of temporary contraceptive led to dramatic changes in social mores including expanding the range of lifestyle options available to women, reducing the reliance of women on men for contraceptive practice, encouraging the delay of marriage, and increasing pre-marital co-habitation.","target":"Pharmaceutical industry","rationale":"The passage mentions the development of oral contraceptives that were used for birth control.

Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\".   His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola.\\nWood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown.  In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns.

WQXL originally aired a Big Band format, which eventually gave way to a Top 40 format by the end of the decade. However it was handicapped with a daytime-only signal and was unsuccessful in competing against format rivals 1230 WNOK and 1400 WCOS, which each had full-time signals. Probably its most notable personality was Mackie \\"Cactus\\" Quave who had worked at 560 WIS (now WVOC) and had a successful kids TV show on NBC Network affiliate Channel 10 WIS-TV. WQXL switched to country music in the summer of 1966, but again was bested by rival 620 WCAY (now WGCV). In 1973, the station switched to religious programming and eventually adopted a Contemporary Christian format.\\n Links: a. WPCO b. Christian radio c. Contemporary Christian music d.

The story and emotional content of a musical  humor, pathos, love, anger  are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole.

Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term \\"costume\\" is regularly linked to the term \\"fashion\\", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while \\"fashion\\" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.\\n\\n- William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised)  23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.

Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.\\n\\n- Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a \\"libretto\\" and their writer, as a \\"librettist\\". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song.\\n\\n- Jerome Robbins (October 11, 1918  July 29, 1998) was an American choreographer, director, dancer, and theater producer who worked in classical ballet, on Broadway, and in films and television.
