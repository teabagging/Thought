Nightcrawler is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. Nightcrawler possesses superhuman agility, the ability to teleport, and adhesive hands and feet.\\n\\nFor a time, Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler express some resentment over the X-Men's failing to contact them after their supposed deaths. Following the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan, Excalibur disbands and Nightcrawler returns to the X-Men with Shadowcat and Colossus. Yet, as soon as they return, they face a group of impostors following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X.  Wanting to devote more time to priesthood, Nightcrawler shares team leadership with Archangel. However, his work as a priest is retconned to be an illusion; he had, in fact, never attained priesthood. He has also met his half-brothers Nils Styger, alias Abyss, and Kiwi Black. With them, Nightcrawler defeated his father Azazel, who had tried to use him as a pawn in escaping his prison.  Later, Nightcrawler served as the new leader of the Uncanny X-Men team alongside Wolverine, Bishop, Psylocke, Cannonball, and Marvel Girl. In the last mission against the Foursaken, Nightcrawler took Marvel Girl, Psylocke, Bishop, and Cannonball to Central Park. He later helped Storm liberate Africa from her uncle's control.  Afterwards, Professor X recruited him, along with Darwin, Havok, Marvel Girl, Warpath, and Polaris, to participate in a space mission to stop Vulcan from laying waste to the Shi'ar empire.

We correlated the changes in RBC morphology and membrane protein composition after oxidant treatment with the alterations in deformability of whole cells and cell membranes. The incubation of RBCs with phenylhydrazine concentrations of 0.3 to 100 mg/dL at 37 degrees C for one hour led to a dose-dependent formation of Heinz bodies, ranging from isolated Heinz bodies at 1 mg/dL to a confluent coating of the inner membrane surface at 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a large quantity of hemoglobin bound to the ghost membrane of treated RBCs. Electrophoresis with and without dithiothreitol indicated that disulfide bridges are abundant between hemoglobin molecules and are also present among membrane proteins but are not the major bond between hemoglobin and membrane. Changes of spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and band 6 and the appearance of a 260,000-dalton complex were also observed. With phenylhydrazine concentrations below 30 mg/dL, even in the presence of multiple Heinz bodies, the RBC deformability measured by filtration through 2.6-, 4.5-, and 6.8-microns pores and the membrane deformability determined by a filter aspiration technique were not altered. With 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine, when the entire membrane was coated with Heinz bodies, RBC filterability and membrane deformability were drastically reduced. These results indicate that oxidative damage of RBCs with discrete Heinz body formation causes focal membrane rigidification but does not affect the global cellular deformability until the Heinz bodies nearly cover the entire cell endoface. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Quantitative relationship between Heinz body formation and red blood cell deformability. option2: Long-term outcome after repair of coarctation in infancy: subclavian angioplasty does not reduce the need for reoperation.","target":"Quantitative relationship between Heinz body formation and red blood cell deformability","rationale":"The title \\"Quantitative relationship between Heinz body formation and red blood cell deformability\\" describes the content of the abstract, which is about how RBC morphology and membrane protein composition change after oxidant treatment with the alterations in deformability of whole cells and cell membranes."},{"source":"Please answer a question about the following article about Age of Enlightenment:\\n\\nThe influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the Enlightenment.

Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Rauschenbusch was a key figure in the Social Gospel and 'Single Tax' movements that flourished in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was also the maternal grandfather of the influential philosopher Richard Rorty and the great-grandfather of Paul Raushenbush.\\n\\n- The Social Gospel was a Protestant movement that was most prominent in the early-20th-century United States and Canada. The movement applied Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues of social justice such as economic inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, unclean environment, child labor, inadequate labor unions, poor schools, and the danger of war. Theologically, the Social Gospellers sought to operationalize the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:10): \\"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\\" They typically were post-millennialist; that is, they believed the Second Coming could not happen until humankind rid itself of social evils by human effort. The Social Gospel was more popular among clergy than laity. Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the Progressive Movement, and most were theologically liberal, although a few were also conservative when it came to their views on social issues. Important leaders include Richard T. Ely, Josiah Strong, Washington Gladden, and Walter Rauschenbusch.\\n\\n- Josiah Strong ( April 14 , 1847 -- June 26 , 1916 ) was an American Protestant clergyman , organizer , editor and author . He was a leader of the Social Gospel movement , calling for social justice and combating social evils . He supported missionary work so that all races could be improved and uplifted and thereby brought to Christ . He is controversial , however , due to his beliefs about race and methods of converting people to Christianity . In his 1885 book Our Country , Strong argued that Anglo Saxons are a superior race who must \`\` Christianize and civilize '' the \`\` savage '' races , which he argued would be good for the American economy and the \`\` lesser races '' .\\n\\n- Richard Theodore Ely (April 13, 1854  October 4, 1943) was an American economist, author, and leader of the Progressive movement who called for more government intervention in order to reform what they perceived as the injustices of capitalism, especially regarding factory conditions, compulsory education, child labor, and labor unions. Ely is best remembered as a founder and the first Secretary of the American Economic Association, as a founder and secretary of the Christian Social Union, and as the author of a series of widely read books on the organized labor movement, socialism, and other social questions.\\n\\n- Washington Gladden (February 11, 1836  July 2, 1918) was a leading American Congregational pastor and early leader in the Social Gospel movement. He was a leading member of the Progressive Movement, serving for two years as a member of the Columbus, Ohio city council and campaigning against Boss Tweed as religious editor of the \\"New York Independent\\". Gladden was probably the first leading U.S. religious figure to support unionization of the workforce; he also opposed racial segregation. He was a prolific writer who wrote hundreds of poems, hymns, articles, editorials, and books.\\n\\n- Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'josiah strong' has the relation 'occupation' with?","target":"pastor","rationale":"The question asks for the entity that 'josiah strong' has a relation of 'occupation' with.

He was one of the most popular American rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, with the Belmonts or with the Del Satins. He is best remembered for the singles \\"Runaround Sue\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", \\"Ruby Baby\\" and \\"Lovers Who Wander\\", among his other hits.\\n\\nBob and Gene Schwartz also signed Dion's friends, the Belmonts, (Carlo Mastrangelo, Fred Milano, and Angelo D'Aleo), a vocal group named for nearby Belmont Avenue, and teamed them, with Dion singing lead. The new group's breakthrough came in early 1958, when \\"I Wonder Why\\" (on their newly formed \\"Laurie\\" label) made No. 22 on the U.S. charts. Dion said of the Belmonts; \\"I'd give 'em sounds. I'd give 'em parts and stuff. That's what 'I Wonder Why' was about. We kind of invented this percussive rhythmic sound. If you listen to that song, everybody was doing something different. There's four guys, one guy was doing bass, I was singing lead, one guy's going 'ooh wah ooh,' and another guy's doing tenor. It was totally amazing. When I listen to it today, oftentimes I think, 'man, those kids are talented.'\\"  Their initial hit was followed by \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Don't Pity Me,\\" which also charted the Billboard Top 100. This success won a place for Dion and the Belmonts on the ill-fated \\"The Winter Dance Party\\" tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson), Frankie Sardo, and other performers. On February 3, 1959, after a concert stop in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly and others decided to charter a flight to the next venue rather than travel on the tour bus. Dion was invited to accompany the group but decided that he did not want to spend $36 for the flight, as it was the same monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment and he couldn't justify the indulgence. The plane crashed, killing all on board; Holly, Valens, Richardson, and the pilot Roger Peterson. Dion and the Belmonts continued on the tour, along with Frankie Sardo, while Bobby Vee, then an unknown artist, performed in Holly's place at the very next concert. Later, Jimmy Clanton, Frankie Avalon, and Fabian were added to replace the other now-deceased headliners.  Dion and the Belmonts' next single, \\"A Teenager in Love,\\" was released in March 1959, eventually hitting No. 5 on the U.S. pop charts and No. 28 in the UK. The group's biggest hit, \\"Where or When,\\" was released in November of that year, and reached No. 3 on the U.S. charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked into hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful. There were musical, personal and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960, Dion decided to quit for a solo career.

Methods: A total of 528 patients with viral pneumonia at RuiJin hospital in Shanghai from May 2015 to May 2019 were recruited. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses. Demographic information, comorbidities, routine laboratory examinations, immunological indexes, etiological detections, radiological images and treatment were collected on admission. Results: 76 (14.4%) patients died within 90 days in hospital. A predictive MuLBSTA score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included multilobular infiltrates (OR = 5.20, 95% CI 1.41-12.52, p = 0.010; 5 points), lymphocyte ≤ 0.8 * 10 9 /L (OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.55-8.05, p < 0.001; 4 points), bacterial coinfection (OR = 3.71, 95% CI 2.11-6.51, p < 0.001; 4 points), acute-smoker (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.34-6.26, p = 0.001; 3 points), quit-smoker (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 0.99-4.82, p = 0.054; 2 points), hypertension (OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.55-4.26, p = 0.003; 2 points) and age ≥60 years (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.04-4.39, p = 0.038; 2 points). 12 points was used as a cut-off value for mortality risk stratification. This model showed sensitivity of 0.776, specificity of 0.778 and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC = 0.773 vs. 0.717, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Here, we designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 90-day mortality risk of viral pneumonia.

He was the field commander for Operation Compass, in which his forces destroyed a much larger Italian army – a victory which nearly drove the Axis from Africa, and in turn, led Adolf Hitler to send the German Africa Corps under Erwin Rommel to try to reverse the situation. O'Connor was captured by a German reconnaissance patrol during the night of 7 April 1941 and spent over two years in an Italian prisoner of war camp. He eventually escaped after the fall of Mussolini in the autumn of 1943. In 1944 he commanded VIII Corps in the Battle of Normandy and later during Operation Market Garden. In 1945 he was General Officer in Command of the Eastern Command in India and then, in the closing days of British rule in the subcontinent, he headed Northern Command.

The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular.

Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.\\nAt a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.\\nThe incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted...\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat are the last names of the band members who believed drugs were planted in the bags of the man who was released on $10,000 bail?","target":"Redding","rationale":"The context mentions two men, Jimi Hendrix and John O'Driscoll.

The group is perhaps best known for hit singles such as \\"Round and Round\\" and \\"Lay It Down\\", tracks that ranked on Billboard's top 40 at No. 12 and No. 40, respectively, as well as other songs such as \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"You're in Love\\" and \\"Dance\\".\\nContext: The origins of Ratt go as far back as 1973 in Hollywood, with a band called Firedome, founded by singer Stephen Pearcy with a few friends. In 1974 the band broke up, with Pearcy forming Crystal Pystal. The name Crystal Pystal was later changed to Buster Cherry, which turned into Mickey Ratt in 1976.  Guitarist Robbin Crosby in those same years had been a member of the bands Metropolis with Tommy Asakawa and Parramore McCarty, Xcalibur, Phenomenon, Secret Service and Mac Meda with Askawa.  Mickey Ratt went through various line-up changes. Members included guitarists Jake E. Lee, Chris Hager, Paul DeNisco, and Bob DeLellis, bassists Matt Thorr, Tim Garcia, Mike New and Dave Jellison, and drummers John Turner, and Bob Eisenberg. The various Mickey Ratt line-ups released several demos compilations and a live concert recording.  In 1980, to increase their chances of landing a recording contract with a major label, the band recorded a single called \\"Dr. Rock\\" / \\"Drivin' on E\\", which was given to fans at their early Los Angeles club shows.  In 1981, the band's name was shortened to Ratt. Crosby played with the band later in the year. Guitarist Warren DeMartini, recommended by Lee, joined the band in January 1982. Bassist Gene Hunter (from Jake E. Lee's Teaser) and drummer Khurt Maier (who played drums on the early \\"Tell the World\\" recording featured on the compilation Metal Massacre I) temporarily played in Ratt before the arrival of Bobby Blotzer (ex-Vic Vergeat) and Juan Croucier (previously with Dokken, and musically active since 1973). DeMartini was only 18 years old when he was called up to Los Angeles to join Ratt. At the time he was attending college in San Diego and was reluctant to drop out to join a band that had, so far, had only limited success. Marq Torien briefly replaced DeMartini, though he returned in time for the recording of their first EP, later in 1982.\\nQuestion: what was the longer name before it was shortened?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Mickey Ratt","rationale":"The paragraph clearly states that the origins of Ratt go as far back as 1973 in Hollywood, with a band called Firedome.

The Vikings took the ball and marched right down the field 80 yards in just 7 plays, with Cassel finding Matt Asiata on a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead just over four minutes into game. This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety Devin McCourty intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, Stevan Ridley scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10-7 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to Darrelle Revis at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17-7. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but Chandler Jones blocked Blair Walsh's field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24-7 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27-7. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30-7 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie Dominique Easley intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game. Brady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be. Stevan Ridley led the Patriots in rushing, carrying the ball 25 times for 101 yards and a touchdown. Filling in for the suspended Adrian Peterson, Matt Asiata carried the ball 13 times for only 36 yards. Matt Cassel went 19 of 36 for 202 yards with 1 touchdown, but was intercepted 4 times by the Patriots.\\nWhat all touchdowns did Brady make?","target":"9-yard","rationale":"To answer the question, we need to find out how many touchdowns Brady made.

So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma.

It weighs more than 1,000 kilos and is at least ten metres long. It has a dark gray colour. Some people say that it looks like a snake. Many people travel to Loch Ness to look for this strange monster, but only a few people say that they saw it.

In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti).

After a 31-yard Jason Hanson field goal, Cleveland scored 21 points on Brady Quinn touchdowns to Mohamed Massaquoi (59 yards), Chansi Stuckey (40 yards), Joshua Cribbs (four yards). The Lions answered with three consecutive TD passes from Matthew Stafford to Aaron Brown (26 yards) and Kevin Smith (25 yards) and a 75-yard catch and run TD for Calvin Johnson. The Browns responded with a 29-yard field goal just before halftime. In the 3rd quarter Will Heller of the Lions caught a one-yard TD pass. The Browns received a safety when Stafford was tackled in his own end zone and called for intentional grounding. The Browns retook the lead on a two-yard TD catch by Michael Gaines and a Jamal Lewis two-point conversion. Stafford was intercepted on the next Lions possession, but the Lions stopped the Browns on 4th and 5. Then they drove 88 yards. With 2 seconds left, Stafford raced out of the pocket and threw a pass into the end zone which was intercepted by Brodney Pool, but the pick was nullified on a Hank Poteat pass interference penalty, giving the Lions one more play with no time left on the clock.  Stafford was brutally hit by two Browns defenders on the play, and suffered what turned out to be a major shoulder separation of his left (non-throwing) arm; he had to come out for the final play and backup Daunte Culpepper went in, but the Browns called time-out; under NFL rules injured players must come out for one play, and the Browns timeout thus made Stafford eligible to return to the field; he told the coaches he wanted to return for the final play (pleading to coaches \\"If you need me to throw the ball, I can throw the ball\\") and was allowed to go back in. He then threw a touchdown to Brandon Pettigrew, and Jason Hanson tacked on the extra point for the win. Stafford became the youngest QB to throw five touchdown passes in a game since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. He also set a record for passing yards in a game by a rookie with 422. For his performance, Stafford won NFC Offensive Player of the Week and Pepsi Rookie of the Week. The game was made into an NFL Film, with Matthew Stafford mic'ed up. It was shown on NFL Network's NFL Replay and Wired for Sound and became a segment in the \\"Quarterback Duels\\" episode of NFL Top 10, as well as Showtime's Inside the NFL.

A few lines and glances by Inspector Robert Highland (played by David Threlfall), riding in the van, seem to indicate that he is on Sean's side, or at least understands the IRA cause with the following lines:    Although I disapprove of the things ye've done, Sean, I can't quite  bring meself to condemn ya. I can't... because I understand where the  hatred comes from. I more than understand it.   When the van comes under siege, the officers don't seem to know what's going on, while Highland just keeps looking at Sean as if they both know exactly what's happening. The two officers then wish to hold out for backup, yet Highland orders them to open the doors. During the discussion afterwards, group leader Kevin O'Donnell seems to believe that Highland is an honest cop, asking him how much the English pay him to turn on his own people (Highland is Irish). O'Donnell then hands a gun to Sean Miller and    Miller promptly executes both Highland and the two officers that were in the van.   I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure about the nuanced context here. The lines may simply be Highland attempting to turn Miller so that he'll testify against the rest of his group, but the glances between them - and the actions of Highland himself - don't really make as much sense in that context. Surely the book would explain such details better than the film.  Was Inspector Highland their man inside (and his fate was only to show how insane Miller is) or was he an honest cop?   And, yes, I realize that a different inside man was revealed at the end of the movie. That doesn't preclude the Inspector being one also, though, or at least an IRA sympathizer/mole.

In each bundle, separating the xylem and phloem, is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as cambium. By the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles (interfascicular cambium), a complete ring is formed, and a regular periodical increase in thickness results from the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside. The soft phloem becomes crushed, but the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial. Owing to differences in the character of the elements produced at the beginning and end of the season, the wood is marked out in transverse section into concentric rings, one for each season of growth, called annual rings.","target":"branches","rationale":"The context explains how dicotyledons, which contain xylem and phloem bundles in their stems, grow. Each season of growth creates a new annual ring that is distinct from previous seasons' rings due to differences in the types of elements produced at the beginning and end of each season (xylem on the inside and phloem on outside). \\nTherefore, branches can be used as an answer since they are part of woody perennials whose bulk comes from the hard wood created by these bundle layers.

It is often said to have begun with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's 1837 introduction of Dirichlet \\"L\\"-functions to give the first proof of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. It is well known for its results on prime numbers (involving the Prime Number Theorem and Riemann zeta function) and additive number theory (such as the Goldbach conjecture and Waring's problem).\\nBranches of analytic number theory.\\nAnalytic number theory can be split up into two major parts, divided more by the type of problems they attempt to solve than fundamental differences in technique.\\n\\n- Robert O. Schlaifer (13 September 1914  24 July 1994) was a pioneer of Bayesian decision theory. At the time of his death he was William Ziegler Professor of Business Administration Emeritus of the Harvard Business School. In 1961 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.\\n\\n- Thomas Bayes (c. 1701 7 April 1761) was an English statistician, philosopher and Presbyterian minister who is known for having formulated a specific case of the theorem that bears his name: Bayes' theorem. Bayes never published what would eventually become his most famous accomplishment; his notes were edited and published after his death by Richard Price.\\n\\n- </math> In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters \\"n\\" and \\"p\\" is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of \\"n\\" independent yes/no experiments, each of which yields success with probability \\"p\\". A success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli experiment or Bernoulli trial; when \\"n\\" = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular binomial test of statistical significance.\\n\\n- Number theory or, in older usage, arithmetic is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. It is sometimes called \\"The Queen of Mathematics\\" because of its foundational place in the discipline. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers).\\n\\n- Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign.\\n\\n- In Bayesian probability theory, if the posterior distributions \\"p\\"(|\\"x\\") are in the same family as the prior probability distribution \\"p\\"(), the prior and posterior are then called conjugate distributions, and the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function. For example, the Gaussian family is conjugate to itself (or \\"self-conjugate\\") with respect to a Gaussian likelihood function: if the likelihood function is Gaussian, choosing a Gaussian prior over the mean will ensure that the posterior distribution is also Gaussian. This means that the Gaussian distribution is a conjugate prior for the likelihood that is also Gaussian. The concept, as well as the term \\"conjugate prior\\", were introduced by Howard Raiffa and Robert Schlaifer in their work on Bayesian decision theory. A similar concept had been discovered independently by George Alfred Barnard.\\n\\n- Bayesian statistics, named for Thomas Bayes (17011761), is a theory in the field of statistics in which the evidence about the true state of the world is expressed in terms of \\"degrees of belief\\" known as Bayesian probabilities. Such an interpretation is only one of a number of interpretations of probability and there are other statistical techniques that are not based on 'degrees of belief'. One of the key ideas of Bayesian statistics is that \\"probability is orderly opinion, and that inference from data is nothing other than the revision of such opinion in the light of relevant new information.\\"\\n\\n- In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is a mathematical function that, stated in simple terms, can be thought of as providing the probability of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. For instance, if the random variable X is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss ('the experiment'), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 for formula_1, and 0.5 for formula_2. \\n\\n- An \\"a priori\\" probability is a probability that is derived purely by deductive reasoning. One way of deriving \\"a priori\\" probabilities is the principle of indifference, which has the character of saying that, if there are \\"N\\" mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and if they are equally likely, then the probability of a given event occurring is 1/\\"N\\". Similarly the probability of one of a given collection of \\"K\\" events is \\"K\\"/\\"N\\".\\n\\n- ([x=i]) = p_i (1-p_i)</math><br>formula_1|\\n\\n- Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a Fourier series is a way to represent a (wave-like) function as the sum of simple sine waves. More formally, it decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or, equivalently, complex exponentials). The discrete-time Fourier transform is a periodic function, often defined in terms of a Fourier series. The Z-transform, another example of application, reduces to a Fourier series for the important case |z|=1. Fourier series are also central to the original proof of the NyquistShannon sampling theorem. The study of Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis.\\n\\n- In probability and statistics , the Dirichlet distribution ( after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet ) , often denoted \\\\ operatorname ( Dir ) ( \\\\ boldsymbol \\\\ alpha ) , is a family of continuous multivariate probability distributions parameterized by a vector \\\\ boldsymbol \\\\ alpha of positive reals . It is the multivariate generalization of the beta distribution . Dirichlet distributions are very often used as prior distributions in Bayesian statistics , and in fact the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution and multinomial distribution . The infinite - dimensional generalization of the Dirichlet distribution is the Dirichlet process .\\n\\n- Howard Raiffa (January 24, 1924  July 8, 2016) was an American academic who was the Frank P. Ramsey Professor (Emeritus) of Managerial Economics, a joint chair held by the Business School and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He was an influential Bayesian decision theorist and pioneer in the field of decision analysis, with works in statistical decision theory, game theory, behavioral decision theory, risk analysis, and negotiation analysis. He helped found and was the first director of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. \\n\\n- Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.\\n\\n- In probability theory and statistics, the beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0, 1] parametrized by two positive shape parameters, denoted by \\"\\" and \\"\\", that appear as exponents of the random variable and control the shape of the distribution.\\n\\n- Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, assigned probabilities represent states of knowledge or belief.\\n\\n- In probability theory and statistics, a shape parameter is a kind of numerical parameter of a parametric family of probability distributions.\\n\\n- A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.\\n\\n- Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty). The higher the probability of an event, the more certain that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is unbiased, the two outcomes (\\"head\\" and \\"tail\\") are both equally probable; the probability of \\"head\\" equals the probability of \\"tail\\". Since no other outcomes are possible, the probability is 1/2 (or 50%), of either \\"head\\" or \\"tail\\". In other words, the probability of \\"head\\" is 1 out of 2 outcomes and the probability of \\"tail\\" is also 1 out of 2 outcomes, expressed as 0.5 when converted to decimal, with the above-mentioned quantification system. This type of probability is also called a priori probability.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'dirichlet distribution' and 'johann peter gustav lejeune dirichlet'?","target":"named after","rationale":"The dirichlet distribution is named after the mathematician Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area.

Semen or migrated sperm fractions were incubated with of 1 mmol of calcium, 5 mmol magnesium, and 10 mmol of creatine phosphate (n = 28) or in the presence of 4 mumol of Verapamil, calcium, and creatine phosphate (n = 10). The samples were subjected to multiple exposure photography (four picture frames of two different drops) at 0, 1, 4, or 5 and at 10 hours and sperm motility and velocity were analyzed. In both calcium and calcium-creatine phosphate conditions, sperm motility and velocity were significantly increased, compared with control values (P = between less than 0.001 and 0.05). Sperm motility declined following Verapamil exposure, but the motility values remained at the level of the control in the presence of additional calcium or creatine phosphate. The effects of calcium and creatine phosphate take place rapidly; within 1 minute all improvements in sperm velocity and motility are fully achieved. There is no loading effect of calcium, and when the sperm is transferred into media without the additional calcium, the velocity decreased to that of the initial control value. Magnesium alone had no effect on motility or velocity. These experiments indicate that calcium or creatine phosphate can support sperm motility and velocity at a significantly increased level. Thus the addition of calcium or creatine phosphate to the insemination media may enhance the fertilizing capacity of sperm during in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures.","target":"Enhancement of human sperm motility and velocity in vitro: effects of calcium and creatine phosphate","rationale":"The title should reflect the focus of the paper, which is to examine how calcium and creatine phosphate affect sperm motility and velocity in specimens of normal donors.

The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public.

The Mesozoic was a time of significant tectonic, climate and evolutionary activity. The era witnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would eventually move into their current positions. The climate of the Mesozoic was varied, alternating between warming and cooling periods. Overall, however, the Earth was hotter than it is today. Non-avian dinosaurs appeared in the Late Triassic and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates early in the Jurassic, occupying this position for about 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous.

POST : I missed Monday, which is the day they announced a special schedule for the next two days (Yesterday, Today). I walked in an hour late to my first class of the day today since I didn't know better and thought the schedule was the usual, and my teacher deadpan said \\"You're an hour late.\\" I handed him my pass, and in passing, said \\"I didn't get an e-mail\\" because this is my first year here, and my old school did everything by email, including announcements where I'd know about these things. \\n\\nI was honestly not aware, and I simply said that I didn't know. I tried to be apologetic. He then proceeded to tell me to exit the class and talk to him outside. \\n\\nHe said he hated how I was retorting (I honestly just wanted to provide some explanation) and that he was upset that I was an hour late (I came on a late start day schedule, we effectively start an hour late) and some other stuff that I can't begin to remember. He was mad. I just stopped listening, at this point he was just ranting and raving, but I remember him saying for me to get back inside and try again. I just passed him silently, I'd already given him my tardy slip. \\n\\nIt was just me that was late that day. He claimed he showed the class the funky schedule for the week. I wasn't there that day (Monday) and when I conferred with other teachers, they said there wasn't even advisory (the time he claimed he showed the class). \\n\\nThe reason I'm unsure if I'm a lesser human being is because I passed by the Conduct Principal and said basically the same thing:\\n\\n\\"Hey, u/Small1324, you're late.\\"\\n\\n\\"Yeah, I didn't get an e-mail.\\"\\n\\n\\"I know you weren't here Monday.

Sometimes I really want to shut up, forever, and watch instead of talk. I'm not good at words, and maybe word choice was the breaking point. \\n\\n2: This teacher is noted by many of my peers to be \\"kind of bad\\" and \\"not worth reasoning with\\". I've seen him with a short fuse and call someone out who was drawing in class while he was lecturing (I think you should only call someone out if they're distracting others. An individual's grade belongs to them). \\n\\n3: avoiding swear words because someone at the school might be watching my every move. There's a team of Sherrifs' deputies that literally just sit at their desks and watch internet content that comes out of us. Lots of strict internet rules I've encountered before, but I'm able to be expelled, and almost the age where I can be charged with crime.\\n\\nEpilogue: I've talked to two other teachers and a senior, both say I'm in the clear (I'm in a similar standing with them, I'm just \\"a\\" student, not a disrupter, not incredibly bright even though I'm apparently \\"gifted\\"). One of the teachers said some teachers might not be accepting of what appears to be a retort, although she also said that this doesn't sound like it. The other teacher was willing to go to that teacher and talk about it. \\n\\nThe senior student realised the core issue for me, I think. The issue was the way I said it. I said \\"I didn't\\" instead of \\"Sorry for not knowing\\". I mean, it's not like I didn't try to apologize, I guess it's just the wrong kind of words came out of my mouth. Not that I'd know, again, not the greatest with words. I'm glad he gave me some good advice as well, check the calendar when school intersects a holiday. \\n\\nI tried to get this tardy excused but the person at the desk essentially said I had to be more vigilant about checking the calendar. \\n\\nSo again, the question. Am I less human for deciding to say something?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\n**TL;DR**: I gave an explanation as to why I'm an hour late, and my teacher pulled me out of class almost immediately and angrily ranted about me \\"retorting\\" when I walked in and said so. I'd have accepted my A status then, but I said this to the Conduct Principal as well while walking to that class and he just said to have a nice day, no anger. \\n\\nAgain, I'm not excusing myself.

And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them.  Christ seemed to have left the world.  The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while.  Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory.  And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church.  Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.

He achieved stardom for his acting achievements. In particular, he is best known for his motion picture portrayal of the classic DC comic book superhero Superman, beginning with the acclaimed Superman (1978), for which he won a BAFTA Award. Reeve appeared in other critically acclaimed films such as The Bostonians (1984), Street Smart (1987) and The Remains of the Day (1993).\\nContext: After graduating from Princeton Day School in June 1970, Reeve acted in plays in Boothbay, Maine and planned to go to New York City to find a career in theater. Instead, at the advice of his mother, he applied for college. He was accepted into Brown, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Cornell, Northwestern, and Princeton. Reeve claimed that he chose Cornell primarily because it is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from New York City, where he planned to start his career as an actor, despite the fact that Princeton and Columbia are considerably closer to the city than Cornell, with Columbia being in New York City, just a few miles uptown from the theater district.  Reeve joined the theater department in Cornell and played Pozzo in Waiting for Godot, Segismundo in Life Is a Dream, Hamlet in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, and Polixenes in The Winter's Tale. Late in his freshman year, Reeve received a letter from Stark Hesseltine, a high-powered agent who had discovered Robert Redford and represented actors such as Richard Chamberlain, Michael Douglas, and Susan Sarandon. Hesseltine had seen Reeve in A Month in the Country and wanted to represent him. The two met and decided that instead of dropping out of school, Reeve could come to New York once a month to meet casting agents and producers to find work for the summer vacation. That summer, he toured in a production of Forty Carats with Eleanor Parker.  The next year, Reeve received a full-season contract with the San Diego Shakespeare Festival, with roles as Edward IV in Richard III, Fenton in The Merry Wives of Windsor, and Dumaine in Love's Labour's Lost at the Old Globe Theatre.  Before his third year of college, Reeve took a three-month leave of absence. He flew to Glasgow and saw theatrical productions throughout the United Kingdom. He was inspired by the actors and often had conversations with them in bars after the performances. He helped actors at the Old Vic with their American accents by reading the newspaper aloud for them. He then flew to Paris, where he spoke fluent French for his entire stay; he had studied it from third grade until his second year in Cornell. He watched many performances and immersed himself in the culture before finally returning to New York to reunite with his girlfriend.\\nQuestion: What was the first thing he was cast in?.

Championships held by Mysterio over the course of his career include WWE's World Heavyweight Championship, the WWE Championship, WCW/WWE Cruiserweight Championship, WCW World Tag Team Championship, WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship, WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship, WWE Tag Team Championship, and WWE Intercontinental Championship.\\n\\nIn 1999, after the two factions of nWo reformed, they demanded that the LWO disband. Mysterio refused to take off his LWO colors and was attacked by the nWo as a result. This led to a match at SuperBrawl IX where Mysterio and tag partner Konnan lost a \\"Hair vs. Mask match\\" against Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, forcing Mysterio to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him the news. Mysterio has publicly expressed his disappointment over being unmasked:  Mysterio later became a \\"giant killer\\" by defeating large opponents such as Kevin Nash, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Scott Norton. He faced Nash at Uncensored in a match where Lex Luger interfered and helped Nash in winning the match. Although he participated in several notable matches with some of the heavyweight top card wrestlers, it was made very clear to him that he would never receive a push to become a main eventer. This was due to Eric Bischoff utilizing cruiserweights as alternative, mid-card entertainment as opposed to the more conventional style that led WCW programming.  The next night on the March 15 Nitro, he defeated Billy Kidman to win his fifth Cruiserweight Championship. On the March 22 Spring Breakout episode of Nitro, Mysterio got his first shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against champion Ric Flair when the names of (allegedly) nearly everyone in the company were put into a hat and a lottery was held. El Dandy was the lottery winner, but he was injured, and Mysterio took the shot instead. The match ended with a disqualification win for Flair, even though Arn Anderson's interference on Flair's behalf should have theoretically disqualified Flair. The following week, Mysterio and Kidman teamed with each other and defeated Flair's Four Horsemen stablemates Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship, making Mysterio a double champion. Mysterio successfully defended his Cruiserweight Championship against his tag team partner Kidman at Spring Stampede before losing the title on the April 19 episode of Nitro to Psicosis in a Fatal Four-Way match that also involved Juventud Guerrera and Blitzkrieg. On the following episode of Nitro, he defeated Psicosis to win his fifth Cruiserweight Championship. At Slamboree, Mysterio and Kidman lost the World Tag Team titles to Raven and Perry Saturn in a Triangle match, also involving former champions Benoit and Malenko.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Rey Mysterio","rationale":"The text is about Rey Mysterio, who was an American professional wrestler.\\nA person can be referred to as \\"he\\" or \\"she\\", which are pronouns that refer back to the subject of a sentence/text (entity).

Ponsonby and Randall Davidson, Dean of Windsor, who had both seen early drafts, advised Victoria against publication, on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair. The manuscript was destroyed. In early 1884, Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands, a sequel to her earlier book, which she dedicated to her \\"devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown\\". On the day after the first anniversary of Brown's death, Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son, Leopold, had died in Cannes. He was \\"the dearest of my dear sons\\", she lamented.

The effective number of codons (ENC) values ranged from 36 to 47.8, indicating a high-to-moderate codon usage bias. The highest IBV codon adaptation index (CAI) value was 0.7, indicating a distant virus versus host synonymous codons usage. The ENC 9 GC3 % curve indicates that both mutational pressure and natural selection are the driving forces on codon usage pattern in S1. The low CAI values agree with a low S protein expression and considering that S protein is a determinant for attachment and neutralization, this could be a further mechanism besides mRNA transcription attenuation for a low expression of this protein leading to an immune camouflage. \\n Title: Avian coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein Ectodomain Shows a Low Codon Adaptation to Gallus gallus with Virus-Exclusive Codons in Strategic Amino Acids Positions","target":"False","rationale":"The title (\\"Avian coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein Ectodomain Shows a Low Codon Adaptation to Gallus gallus with Virus-Exclusive Codons in Strategic Amino Acids Positions\\") is too long and does not provide an appropriate summary of the main findings of the study.

It was directed by Rupert Sanders, and post-production was conducted by Asylum. It was filmed in Hungary, just outside Budapest in a coal mine and abandoned factories to give the sequence an \\"Eastern Bloc\\" aesthetic. The commercial and its associated campaign proved hugely successful; on the week of its launch, Halo 3: ODST became the top-selling game for the Xbox 360 worldwide, and over 2.5 million copies were sold within the first few weeks of release.

Whereas epibolin alone in defined medium supports some cell spreading, the purified plasma coepibolin preparations do not effect spreading in the absence of epibolin. Although not yet entirely purified, coepibolin associates with some plasma fractions but not with others; it is certainly not a property of all proteins, e.g., while bovine serum albumin (BSA) has coepibolin activity, ovalbumin does not. The data presented here show that the phorbol ester, 12-tetra-decanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can act as a potent coepibolin and support maximal spreading over a concentration range of 10-100 ng/ml. In the absence of epibolin TPA does not stimulate the spreading of epidermal cells when given alone or in the presence of BSA or ovalbumin. Coepibolin activity appears to associate with tumor-promoting activity in that the phorbol derivative, phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, shows coepibolin activity, while its inactive non-tumor-promoting isomer, phorbol-4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, does not. These data suggest that the proteinaceous plasma-derived cofactor acts in a fashion similar to TPA and that this as yet unexplained mechanism of TPA action is important to the full expression of epibolin and to the early phase of epidermal cell spreading. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Phorbol ester serves as a coepibolin in the spreading of primary guinea pig epidermal cells. option2: Highest inhabitants in the world [letter]","target":"Phorbol ester serves as a coepibolin in the spreading of primary guinea pig epidermal cells","rationale":"The abstract provides information about the effects of phorbol esters on epidermal cell spreading.

Vulcanization -- The vulcanization of neoprene or polychloroprene rubber (CR rubber) is carried out using metal oxides (specifically MgO and ZnO, sometimes PbO) rather than sulfur compounds which are presently used with many natural and synthetic rubbers. In addition, because of various processing factors (principally scorch, this being the premature cross-linking of rubbers due to the influence of heat), the choice of accelerator is governed by different rules to other diene rubbers. Most conventionally used accelerators are problematic when CR rubbers are cured and the most important accelerant has been found to be ethylene thiourea (ETU), which, although being an excellent and proven accelerator for polychloroprene, has been classified as reprotoxic. The European rubber industry has started a research project SafeRubber to develop a safer alternative to the use of ETU.","target":"No","rationale":"Looking at the passage, we can see that vulcanisation of rubber uses metal oxides such as MgO and ZnO.

Passage:McGillivray returned to Montreal in 1793 and then took a trip to Scotland and England. He was now a partner in McTavish, Frobisher & Co., who controlled the NWC. With John Gregory, he was sent to manage the company's huge depot at Grand Portage, stirring jealousy among some of the other partners. When Joseph Frobisher retired in 1798, McGillivray took his place. He set up an agency at New York City to get around the East India Company's monopoly enabling them to trade with China. He was closely involved too with the firm of McTavish, Fraser & Co., at London, managed by another relation of his uncle's, John Fraser. In 1803, he helped organize the move of the NWC's main depot from Grand Portage to Thunder Bay. All this time he was dealing with relations with the Hudson's Bay Company and the splinter XY Company that had broken away from the NWC, led by John Richardson.","target":"b","rationale":"The passage does not provide any information about Frobisher's age, nor can any clues be found to answer the question."},{"source":"You are given two sentences.

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.\\n\\n- The New Siberian Islands are an archipelago in the Extreme North of Russia, to the North of the East Siberian coast between the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea north of the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic.\\n\\n- Anjou is an historical and cultural region of France, a former French county (in that it was ruled by a count, from ), duchy (1360), and province. Its capital was the city of Angers in the lower Loire Valley. The territory has no very clear geographical borders but instead owes its territory and prominence to the fortunes of its various rulers.\\n\\n- An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.\\n\\n- The Laptev Sea (\\"more Laptevykh\\") is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. It is located between the northern coast of Siberia, the Taimyr Peninsula, Severnaya Zemlya and the New Siberian Islands. Its northern boundary passes from the Arctic Cape to a point with co-ordinates of 79°N and 139°E, and ends at the Anisiy Cape.

Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.\\nIn late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea.

In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

Founded in 1818, it is home to the University of Missouri and is the principal city of the Columbia Metropolitan Area. It is Missouri's fourth most populous city, with an estimated population of 119,108 in 2015. As a midwestern college town, the city has a reputation for progressive politics, public art, and powerful journalism. The tripartite establishment of Stephens College (1833), the University of Missouri (1839), and Columbia College (1851) has long made the city a center of education, culture, and athletic competition; these three schools surround the city's central business district to the east, south, and north. At the center of Downtown is the Avenue of the Columns, which connects Francis Quadrangle and Jesse Hall to the Boone County Courthouse and the City Hall. Originally an agricultural town, the cultivation of the mind is Columbia's chief economic concern today. Never a major center of manufacturing, the city also depends on healthcare, insurance, and technology businesses. Several companies, such as Shelter Insurance, Carfax, and Slackers CDs and Games, were founded in the city. Cultural institutions include the State Historical Society of Missouri, the Museum of Art and Archaeology, and the annual True/False Film Festival.

It is primarily used for football and serves as the home field for the Missouri Tigers football program. In 1972, Memorial Stadium's playing surface was named Faurot Field in honor of longtime coach Don Faurot. During the offseason, soccer goals are set up in the end zones and it is used for intramural matches. Until 2012 it was the site of the annual \\"Providence Bowl\\" game between Hickman and Rock Bridge high schools, so named because both schools are located on Providence Road in Columbia, and Faurot is roughly equidistant between the two. This tradition stopped when Missouri joined the Southeastern Conference and conference scheduling made hosting the game more difficult. Faurot Field was also been home to the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) football championships for many years, now held in St. Louis in the climate-controlled Edward Jones Dome. It is the second-largest sports facility by seating capacity in the state of Missouri, to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. \\n\\n- A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy.

Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space.

Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.\\n\\nWater stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes.

Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which of the two areas had less salinity?","target":"Area A","rationale":"In the background, it is mentioned that stratification creates layers of water with different salinity.

Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied.\\nThe subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87.

Production levels peak at around 40 to 60 days after calving. Production declines steadily afterwards until milking is stopped at about 10 months. The cow is \`\`dried off'' for about sixty days before calving again. Within a 12 to 14-month inter-calving cycle, the milking period is about 305 days or 10 months long. Among many variables, certain breeds produce more milk than others within a range of around 6,800 to 17,000 kg (15,000 to 37,500 lbs) of milk per year. The Holstein Friesian is the main breed of dairy cattle in Australia, and said to have the \`\`world's highest'' productivity, at 10000L of milk per year. The average for a single dairy cow in the US in 2007 was 9164.4 kg (20,204 lbs) per year, excluding milk consumed by her calves, whereas the same average value for a single cow in Israel was reported in the Philippine press to be 12,240 kg in 2009.

In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall.

This vast amount of new information makes possible more comprehensive and accurate target identification using several new computational approaches, including identification of metabolic \\"choke-points\\", searching the parasite proteomes for orthologues of known drug targets, and identification of parasite proteins likely to interact with known drugs and drug-like small molecules. In this chapter, we describe several databases (such as GENEDB, BRENDA, KEGG, METACYC, the THEM-PEUTIC TARGET DATABASE, and CHEMBaNK) and algorithms (including PATHOLOGIC, PATHWAY HUNTER TOOL, AND AUTODOCI0 which have been developed to facilitate the bioinformatic analyses underlying these approaches. While target identification is only the first step in the drug development pipeline, these new approaches give rise to renewed optimism for the discovery of new drugs to combat the devastating diseases caused by these parasites. Traditionally, drug discovery in the trypanosomatids (and other organisms) has proceeded from two different starting points: screening large numbers of existing compounds for activity against whole parasites or more focused screening of compounds for activity against defined molecular targets. Most existing anti-trypanosomatids drugs were developed using the former approach, although the latter has gained much attention in the last twenty years under the rubric of \\"rational drug design\\". Until recently, one of the major bottlenecks in anti-trypanosomatid drug development has been our ability to identify good targets, since only a very small percentage of the total number of trypanosomatid genes were known. That has now changed forever, with the recent (July, 2005) publication of the \\"Tritryp\\" (Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major) genome sequences.

The Canadians would go on to win the inaugural edition of the tournament in a penalty shoot-out, with Huitema scoring the winning shoot-out goal. She would go on to make 10 more appearances for the under-15 squad. Huitema's debut for the under-17 team came on March 3, 2016 at the CONCACAF Women's Under-17 Championship in a 3–0 win against Guatemala. Huitema played in the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. There, she scored her first goal in FIFA competition in a 3–2 win over Cameroon. She made 7 more appearances for the under-17 team. On July 6, 2017, Huitema made her first appearance for the under-20 team, scoring a goal in a 4–1 win over the United States. After scoring in a 3–1 loss to China in an under 17 match on July 12, 2017, Huitema became the first Canadian to score for the under 17, under 20 and senior national team in the same calendar year. In 2017, she was named the Canada U17 Female Player of the Year for her performances with the U-17, U-20 and senior teams throughout the year. On January 12, 2018, Huitema was named to Canada's squad for the 2018 CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship in Trinidad & Tobago. In the first game of the tournament, Huitema scored twice in a 3–1 win over Costa Rica. In the second game, Huitema scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over hosts Trinidad & Tobago, which clinched Canada's progress into the semi-finals. She would play 66 minutes in a 4–0 victory over Haiti which resulted in Canada winning their group. In the semi-finals against Mexico, Huitema played the full game in a 1–1 draw. Canada would lose the match 4–3 on penalty kicks in which Huitema saw her attempt saved. Canada would require a win over Haiti in the third place match to qualify for the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in France later in the year. Canada would lose the match by a score of 1–0 and fail to qualify for the U-20 World Cup. Huitema was the tournament's top scorer with five goals and was named to the Best XI of the championship.\\n Passage 2:Due to his actions during the battle, former Army Captain William D. Swenson was recommended to receive the Medal of Honor by Marine General John R. Allen. Having been critical of the officers superior to him during the battle, he left the Army in February 2011. A 2012 investigation by McClatchy News Service concluded that the justification for Meyer's decoration may have been inflated and that the nomination for Swenson's Medal of Honor may have been intentionally lost. Meyer disputes McClatchy's allegations in his book, Into the Fire: A Firsthand Account of the Most Extraordinary Battle in the Afghan War. In August 2012, California Representative Duncan D. Hunter wrote to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta regarding the Medal of Honor nomination of Swenson, comparing his case to that of Sgt. Rafael Peralta. In January 2013, Representative Hunter said Swenson's nomination had been awaiting President Barack Obama's approval at the White House since at least July 2012.

The Force Publique performed well on the battlefield, winning the respect of their British and Portuguese allies, as well as that of their German opponents. 1916 onwards, the Force Publique grew to reach a strength of three mobile Groupes (brigades), Kivu, Ruzizi, and Tanganyika, comprising a total of 15 battalions, from the static garrison and police force of 1914. However, it did take until late 1915 for the Force Publique to finish preparations for a large scale offensive on the German colony of German East Africa. The allied powers, the British Empire and Belgium launched a coordinated attack on the German colony, by 1916 the Belgian commander of the Force Publique, Lieutenant-General Charles Tombeur, had assembled an army of 15,000 men supported by local bearers and advanced to Kigali. Kigali was taken by 6 May 1916. The German army stationed in Burundi was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Belgian army and by 17 June 1916, Burundi and Rwanda were occupied. The Force Publique and the British Lake Force then started a thrust to capture Tabora, an administrative centre of central German East Africa. The army went on to take Tabora on 19 September after heavy fighting. At the time of the Battle of Tabora in September 1916 about 25,000 men were under arms, during the war their actions were supported by more than 260,000 local bearers. In 1916 Charles Tombeur was made Military Governor of the Belgian Occupied East African Territories. After the Mahenge Offensive and the capture of Mahenge in 1917, the Belgian Congolese army controlled roughly one-third of German East Africa. After the war, as outlined in the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forced to cede \\"control\\" of the Western section of the former German East Africa to Belgium.

In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King of England, joining Scotland with England in a personal union. In 1707, the two kingdoms were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the terms of the Acts of Union. From the final capture of the Royal Burgh of Berwick by the Kingdom of England in 1482 (following the annexation of the Northern Isles from the Kingdom of Norway in 1472) the territory of the Kingdom of Scotland corresponded to that of modern-day Scotland, bounded by the North Sea to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest.\\n\\n- Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain.

This theory had been widely accepted by scientists. But one question remains: how do these animals manage to do that?\\nAfter more than 150 years, scientists are finally able to answer that question--it is all down to a gene   called \\"doublesex\\", according to a study published on March 6 in the journalNature.\\nIn fact, scientists have long known that genes are responsible for this useful ability. But until the new study, scientists hadn't been able to find out which genes in particular were responsible.\\nScientists at the University of Chicago compared the genetic structures of the Common Mormons that changed their wing patterns with those of ones that did not. And all the results pointed to a single gene, \\"doublesex\\".\\nThis was much to the scientists' surprise.

For example, one gene would control the color of the upper part of the wing, one would do so for the lower part.\\nHowever, the \\"doublesex\\" gene doesn't quite do everything by itself. Instead, it acts like a switch--it \\"tells\\" other genes to change the wing patterns.

From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).\\n\\n- The Gulf of Finland  is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.\\n\\n- REMA 1000 is a multinational no-frills supermarket chain owned entirely by the Reitan Group (Reitangruppen).

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n- Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano).

It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.\\n\\n- Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262).

Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\\n\\n- An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration).

In 1991 Norsk Hydro acquired the 330 outlets of the Danish operation and five years later it bought the Swedish Uno-X chain from Burmah. \\n\\n- Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\\n\\n- The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development.

A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\\n\\n- YX Energi, formerly known as Hydro Texaco, is a Norwegian and Danish gas station chain formed after the merge of the Hydro and Texaco gas station chains in 1995. In 2006 the company was bought by Reitangruppen and incorporated into their chain including the implementation of 7-Eleven brand on the service stations. Uno-X and Rema Bensin are low-cost brand names of YX.\\n\\n- A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.\\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...\\n\\n- Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.

He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\".

He faced further rejection by Relativity Records, the label behind Vai's Sex & Religion, who saw no commercial appeal in his music. Century Media Records subsequently contacted the musician, offering him a contract to \\"make us some extreme albums\\". Townsend agreed to a five-album deal with the record label.Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, under the moniker Strapping Young Lad. According to Townsend, the recording process took \\"about a week\\". Embracing The Wildhearts' anarchist approach, \\"while focusing on dissonance and just being as over-the-top as [he] could\\", Townsend sang on the record and performed the majority of its instrumental tracks (with the assistance of a drum machine).  A few songs, however, featured local session musicians, including guitarist Jed Simon, Townsend's future bandmate.\\nReleased on April 4, 1995, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing was not widely recognized in the metal community. The album sold 143 copies in its first six months, but received favorable reviews from the heavy metal press. Its unusual musical ideas—a synthesis of death, thrash, and industrial metal influences—prompted Andy Stout from Metal Hammer to call it \\"one of the most disturbing albums you'll hear for a very long time\\".

The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

Anchariids are a strictly freshwater group endemic to Madagascar . Anchariids are characterized by the presence of fringed barbels and a reduced anterior nuchal plate . Traditionally , Ancharius is classified in Ariidae . The general consensus in recent years is that anchariids are members of Ariidae and do not warrant family rank . However , this family was recently revised in 2005 , which reinstated the separate family for Ancharius and described the genus Gogo . A molecular analysis grouped Anchariidae with Ariidae under the superfamily Arioidea .\\n\\n- In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain.\\n\\n- India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.\\n\\n- In paleogeography, Gondwana,\\nalso Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it.\\n\\n- Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\\n\\n- Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example).\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'parent taxon' with the subject 'anchariidae'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- area\\n - human\\n - laurentia\\n - mya\\n - siluriformes","target":"siluriformes","rationale":"The entity 'anchariidae' is a family of fish belonging to the order Siluriformes, which represent its parent taxon.

Dissocial personality disorder (DPD), a similar or equivalent concept, is defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), which includes antisocial personality disorder in the diagnosis. Both manuals provide similar criteria for diagnosing the disorder. Both have also stated that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, but distinctions have been made between the conceptualizations of antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy, with many researchers arguing that psychopathy is a disorder that overlaps with, but is distinguishable from, ASPD.\\nBased on the previous passage, are antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy the same?","target":"No","rationale":"The passage states that though the diagnostic manuals have stated that their diagnoses include what is referred to as psychopathy or sociopathy, distinctions have been made between antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy.

This is done by using a magnetic field to induce a current in the generator’s windings. This current can be either alternating or direct, depending on how it was set up initially. Alternating currents typically have frequencies between 0 and 100 Hz (100 cycles per second). They are used for most power transmission because of their ability to efficiently transfer power over long distances without being affected as much by resistance within wires. Direct currents do not change direction at any point; they remain constant throughout the circuit they pass through in one uniform direction from positive terminal to negative terminal until interrupted by an open switch or some other interrupting mechanism\\nGenerators present in cars use alternating currents, so the answer is \\"Alternating Current\\""},{"source":"Answer based on context:\\n\\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Saints, the Jets flew to Land Shark Stadium for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with their AFC East rival, the Miami Dolphins.  New York immediately trailed as the Dolphins took the game's opening drive and capped it off with a 1-yard touchdown run from running Ronnie Brown.  The Jets immediately responded with rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to newly acquired wide receiver Braylon Edwards.  Afterwards, Miami closed out the opening quarter with a 35-yard field goal from kicker Dan Carpenter.  In the second quarter, New York took the lead as kicker Jay Feely got a 40-yard and a 43-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, both the Jets and the Dolphins would get involved in a back-and-forth fourth quarter.  Miami opened up the period with quarterback Chad Henne hooking up with tight end Anthony Fasano on a 2-yard touchdown pass, while New York got a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Thomas Jones.  The Dolphins would immediately respond as Henne threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr., but Jones came through again with a 3-yard touchdown run.

Passage:In 1986, Talk Talk, then a three-piece band consisting of leader and singer Mark Hollis alongside drummer Lee Harris and bassist Paul Webb, released their third album The Colour of Spring, which saw the band shift from their earlier, synthpop-oriented sound and featured a more organic art rock sound, where musicians improvised with their instruments for many hours, then Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene edited and arranged the performances to get the sound they wanted. A total of sixteen musicians appeared on the album. It became their most successful album, selling over two million copies and prompting a major world tour. Nonetheless, for their next album Spirit of Eden (1988), the band chose to work towards an even more unconventional and uncommercial direction. The album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London's Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988 where the band worked again with Friese-Greene and engineer Phill Brown. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances which were heavily edited and re-arranged into the final album.\\n Links: a. Spirit of Eden b. Art rock c.

During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \\"Badami Chalukyas\\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \\"Chalukyan architecture\\".

To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a %-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain. The technique of in situ hybridization with film autoradiography should be generally useful for analyzing macroscopic movements of virus within infected organs.

You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\\nThat’s right, you STOP!\\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\\nThis isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).\\nHow do people generally feel about Emily Nagoski's book Come as You are?\\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\\n\\nA. people aren't generally interested in the book\\n\\nB. people are indifferent to the book\\n\\nC. not enough information\\n\\nD. people are eager to get their mitts on the book","target":"D","rationale":"The text states that the \\"entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book\\". The word 'eager' is an adjective which means keenly desirous; impatiently longing. It has a positive connotation, so it implies interest in the book and therefore cannot be option A or B. Option C doesn't make sense because we are given plenty of information about how people feel towards Emily Nagoski's new book Come As You Are, hence answer D makes most sense here."},{"source":"In this task, you will be given a debate topic, along with a sentence from the debate.

Passage 1:Davis sailed for San Francisco, California, around Cape Horn in 1852, and upon arriving, engaged for a brief time as a gold miner, a lumber supercargo surveyor for a coastal steamer, and a purser for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In addition he helped found the Mercantile Library Association of California (its oldest public library). Under his administrative tutelage interest in the library was restored with his creation of a library catalog (an act which later lead to his poor eyesight). He resigned in 1855 and relocated to San Francisco in 1860 at which time he established the highly successful Golden Gate Flouring Mills and the Sperry Flour Company. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1862. When the American Civil War broke out, he served in the secretive San Francisco-based Home Guard acting to secure both the loyalty of California to then Union President Abraham Lincoln and the election of Leland Stanford as governor of California (by patrolling the polls on election day). He presided over the Produce Exchange of San Francisco from 1867 to 1877 until he was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives of the Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth Congresses (March 4, 1877 - March 3, 1881), where on June 8, 1878 he spoke in support of a bill to restrict Chinese immigration. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1880 to the Forty-seventh Congress.\\n Passage 2:There is archaeological evidence such as a blade implement and arrowheads to suggest habitation as early as the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras. The Bronze Age finds in the area have proved more numerous. They have included a set of ring ditches, a rapier and several spearheads. The village is also noteworthy as the site of a substantial Iron Age hillfort, alternatively known as a bertune, which would later be pronounced \\"Burton\\" in the Norman fashion (the name of the village until the early 14th-century). Excavated in 1950–1951, The discovery of Gaulish-made samian ware and a distinctive coin, along with coarse-gritted and medieval pottery, have led archaeologists to believe that the fort was occupied by Roman soldiers sometime after their invasion of Britain in 43 AD under Vespasian. Such was not uncommon in other hill forts of the Iron Age, with Maiden Castle and Hod Hill, both in the county of Dorset, later occupied by Romans as strategic military bases.\\n Passage 3:The \\"square\\" is actually triangular in shape.

He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation).

In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design.

Despite the success of these drugs, their efficacy is limited in patients whose tumors demonstrate de novo or acquired resistance to treatment. The β1 integrin resides on the membrane of the breast cancer cell, activating several elements of breast tumor progression including proliferation and survival.   \\n METHODS We developed a panel of HER2-overexpressing cell lines resistant to L, T, and the potent LT combination through long-term exposure and validated these models in 3D culture. Parental and L/T/LT-resistant cells were subject to HER2 and β1 integrin inhibitors in 3D and monitored for 12 days, followed by quantification of colony number. Parallel experiments were conducted where cells were either stained for Ki-67 and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) or harvested for protein and analyzed by immunoblot. Results were subjected to statistical testing using analysis of variance and linear contrasts, followed by adjustment with the Sidak method.   \\n RESULTS Using multiple cell lines including BT474 and HCC1954, we reveal that in L and LT resistance, where phosphorylation of EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER3 are strongly inhibited, kinases downstream of β1 integrin--including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src--are up-regulated. Blockade of β1 by the antibody AIIB2 abrogates this up-regulation and functionally achieves significant growth inhibition of L and LT resistant cells in 3D, without dramatically affecting the parental cells. SiRNA against β1 as well as pharmacologic inhibition of FAK achieve the same growth inhibitory effect. In contrast, trastuzumab-resistant cells, which retain high levels of phosphorylated EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER3, are only modestly growth-inhibited by AIIB2.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that HER2 activity, which is suppressed in resistance involving L but not T alone, dictates whether β1 mediates an alternative pathway driving resistance.

Aarons with whom he formed a long term producing partnership. Their first major hit was Lady Be Good! (1924) with music and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin and featuring Fred Astaire and Adele Astaire. Over the next ten years the pair produced some of the most important works in the Broadway musical canon, featuring some of the most famous songs ever to emerge from the tin pan alley era, part of what is commonly referred to as \\"The Great American Songbook.\\" The shows that followed included Tip-Toes (1925), Oh, Kay! (1926), and Funny Face (1927), again starring the Astaires. All the scores were written by the Gershwins. In 1928 Aarons and Freedley produced Here's Howe, featuring the music of Gus Kahn, Joseph Meyer, and Irving Caesar; Hold Everything!, with a score by Buddy DeSylva and Lew Brown; and Treasure Girl, with music by the Gershwins. In 1929 followed Spring Is Here and Heads Up!, both with songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Another Gershwin hit was Girl Crazy (1930). The partnership ended in 1932. Freedley produced 30 shows total on Broadway.\\n Passage 2:Watters played for ten seasons in the NFL with San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Seattle. He was selected by San Francisco in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft, but sat out the entire 1991 season with injuries. He started at running back for the 49ers during the next three seasons and San Francisco's offense led the NFL in scoring and yardage each year. The 49ers reached the NFC Championship Game in 1992 and 1993, falling both times to the Dallas Cowboys, before finally vanquishing Dallas in the 1994 NFC title game on their way to a Super Bowl championship. In a January 1994 divisional playoff, Watters set an NFL postseason record with five rushing touchdowns in the game, as the 49ers trounced the New York Giants 44-3. In Super Bowl XXIX the following season, Watters scored three touchdowns in San Francisco's 49-26 victory over the San Diego Chargers, tying a Super Bowl mark shared by fellow 49ers Roger Craig and Jerry Rice, and later matched by Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos.\\n Passage 3:Hamilton Fish (August 3, 1808September 7, 1893) was an American politician who served as the 16th Governor of New York from 1849 to 1850, a United States Senator from New York from 1851 to 1857 and the 26th United States Secretary of State from 1869 to 1877. Fish is recognized as the \\"pillar\\" of the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant and considered one of the best U.S. Secretaries of State by scholars, known for his judiciousness and efforts towards reform and diplomatic moderation. Fish settled the controversial Alabama Claims with Great Britain through his development of the concept of international arbitration. Fish kept the United States out of war with Spain over Cuban independence by coolly handling the volatile Virginius Incident. In 1875, Fish initiated the process that would ultimately lead to Hawaiian statehood, by having negotiated a reciprocal trade treaty for the island nation's sugar production. He also organized a peace conference and treaty in Washington D.C. between South American countries and Spain. Fish worked with James Milton Turner, America's first African American consul, to settle the Liberian-Grebo war. President Grant said he trusted Fish the most for political advice.","target":"1","rationale":"Passage 1 is the only one that has information about Fred Astaire's career in the theatre."},{"source":"Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type.

Piercing guns are not made for cartilage, as the blunt force of the gun can shatter it and deform your ear. At Walmart they are not even allowed to use the gun on cartilage. how long will it take for my nose piercing to heal Will it hurt? How long will it take to heal? Where do I get it done? These are just a few of the many questions you might have. In the following paragraphs I will answer some of these most frequently asked questions, go over the pros and cons, and offer some helpful hints on caring for cartilage piercings. Here is a list of measures that you need to follow for the fast and complete healing of the cartilage piercing infection and scarring:-. 1  Any kind of contact of the affected area with the unhygienic components in the environment should be avoided. 2  It is mandatory to clean the pierced area at least once daily. How Long Does A Cartilage Piercing Take To Heal? Cartilage piercings take a bit longer to heal than piercings on fleshy parts, like the earlobes. You can expect it to take 3 to 6 months for your new piercing to be completely healed. It really depends upon your own healing process because everyone’s body works a bit differently. How long does a cartilage piercing take to heal? *cough* I'm also going to get a cartilage piercing.. how bad does that one hurt on a scale from 1-10, how long does it take to heal (or, I mean, how long until I can change the earring), how long can't I sleep on it for, and which hurts more, with a needle, or with a gun?? The outer conch piercing is performed at the outer rim of the ear cartilage and the inner conch piercing takes place at the center of the ear cartilage. This type of piercing method does not take much time to heal, at the most six to eight months only. Another type of piercing is conducted at the thick fleshy fold of the ear called the tragus which is actually very painful in nature and takes a long time, not less than 4 months to heal. Source : 3.bp.blogspot. 1  The ear lobe piercing is the most common type of ear piercing. 2  The piercing of the helix which is the part of the upper ear cartilage, used for the task of ornamentation is usually done with a small gauged hollow piercing needle or a cartilage piercing hoop or a stud. The pierced portion of the helix takes around six to eight months to heal. · just now. 1  It takes up to 6 months for cartilage piercings to heal and it'll probably be sore to sleep on that side for a month, best case scenario, and possibly longer. 2  It would heal quicker and be less painful too if you did not put surgical spirits on it and did not fiddle with it either. I have 5 cartlige piercing. 1 industrial 1 anti-tragus and 3cartlige studs. they all take different amounts of time it is how your body reacts to the piercing and if your getting just a stud, go for the gun but if your actully geting like a trugus or industrial or something major get it done with a needle. if you do roll over in it, its not the end of the world and it will only be accouple iod days until you can fall asleep on it, but it might annoy you. honestly no matter what people say ...

But the urinary system is only one part of the excretory system. Recall that the excretory system is also made up of the skin, lungs, and large intestine, as well as the kidneys. The urinary system is the organ system that makes, stores, and gets rid of urine. 1. As you can see above ( Figure 1.1), the kidneys are two bean-shaped organs. Kidneys filter and clean the blood and form urine. They are about the size of your fists and are found near the middle of the back, just below your ribcage. 2. Ureters are tube-shaped and bring urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. 3. The urinary bladder is a hollow and muscular organ. It is shaped a little like a balloon. It is the organ that collects urine. 4. Urine leaves the body through the urethra. The kidneys filter the blood that passes through them, and the urinary bladder stores the urine until it is released from the body. Urine is a liquid that is formed by the kidneys when they filter wastes from the blood. Urine contains mostly water, but it also contains salts and nitrogen-containing molecules. The amount of urine released from the body depends on many things. Some of these include the amount of fluid and food a person consumes and how much fluid they have lost from sweating and breathing. Urine ranges from colorless to dark yellow but is usually a pale yellow color. Light yellow urine contains mostly water. The darker the urine, the less water it contains. The urinary system also removes a type of waste called urea from your blood. Urea is a nitrogen-containing molecule that is made when foods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables, are broken down in the body. Urea and other wastes are carried in the bloodstream to the kidneys, where they are removed and form urine. \\n Question: urine leaves the body through the","target":"urethra","rationale":"The question is \\"urine leaves the body through the\\" and the answer is a word or phrase from context passage.

Early on, the process was referred to as “gerrymandering,” where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout.\\nRepublicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats have come under fire as well for partisan maps in states where they control the legislature, like Maryland and Massachusetts.\\nDuring Tuesday’s oral arguments, the more liberal high court justices seemed open to the case brought by Democratic voters. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said a ruling in favor of the Republican districting plan in Wisconsin would encourage others to stack the deck against their political opponents. “What becomes of the...\\nHow long did the supreme court consider the case?\\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\\n- six months\\n- one week\\n- not enough information\\n- two weeks","target":"two weeks","rationale":"The context mentions that the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters.\\nThis suggests that they began considering the case after hearing both sides of it, which means they considered it for approximately two weeks (the length of time between when an issue is first presented and when oral arguments are made).

Tactics for working with mathematical formulas are different from tactics for working with conversion factors. First, most of the questions you will have to answer using formulas are word-type questions, so the first step is to identify what quantities are known and assign them to variables. Second, in most formulas, some mathematical rearrangements (i. , algebra) must be performed to solve for an unknown variable. The rule is that to find the value of the unknown variable, you must mathematically isolate the unknown variable by itself and in the numerator of one side of the equation. Finally, units must be consistent. For example, in Boyle’s law there are two pressure variables; they must have the same unit. There are also two volume variables; they also must have the same unit.

As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.

This is fair enough in its own way, because the world does need some standard blue collar and white collar jobs to continue its existence; but this is a choice that children should be allowed to make for themselves.

Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum.\\n\\n- A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\\n\\n- In mathematics , a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements . For example , the sequence \\\\ langle A , B , D \\\\ rangle is a subsequence of \\\\ langle A , B , C , D , E , F \\\\ rangle obtained after removal of elements C , E , and F. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a preorder . The subsequence should not be confused with substring \\\\ langle A , B , C , D \\\\ rangle which can be derived from the above string \\\\ langle A , B , C , D , E , F \\\\ rangle by deleting substring \\\\ langle E , F \\\\ rangle . The substring is a refinement of the subsequence .\\n\\n- In mathematics, especially in order theory, a preorder or quasiorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive. Preorders are more general than equivalence relations and (non-strict) partial orders, both of which are special cases of a preorder.\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is at the same time a reflexive relation, a symmetric relation and a transitive relation. As a consequence of these properties an equivalence relation provides a partition of a set into equivalence classes.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed. Like a set, it contains members (also called \\"elements\\", or \\"terms\\"). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the \\"length\\" of the sequence. Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first \\"n\\" natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length \\"n\\"). The position of an element in a sequence is its \\"rank\\" or \\"index\\"; it is the integer from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or of a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1. When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the \\"n\\"th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with \\"n\\" as subscript; for example, the \\"n\\"th element of the Fibonacci sequence is generally denoted \\"F\\".\\n\\n- In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in \\"there are \\"six\\" coins on the table\\") and ordering (as in \\"this is the \\"third\\" largest city in the country\\"). In common language, words used for counting are \\"cardinal numbers\\" and words used for ordering are \\"ordinal numbers\\".\\n\\n- Order theory is a branch of mathematics which investigates the intuitive notion of order using binary relations. It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as \\"this is less than that\\" or \\"this precedes that\\". This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions. A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the order theory glossary.\\n\\n- Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a binary relation on a set \\"A\\" is a collection of ordered pairs of elements of \\"A\\". In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product \\"A\\" = . More generally, a binary relation between two sets \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" is a subset of .

Horns are widely used as antennas at UHF and microwave frequencies, above 300 MHz. They are used as feed antennas (called feed horns) for larger antenna structures such as parabolic antennas, as standard calibration antennas to measure the gain of other antennas, and as directive antennas for such devices as radar guns, automatic door openers, and microwave radiometers. Their advantages are moderate directivity, low standing wave ratio (SWR), broad bandwidth, and simple construction and adjustment.\\n\\n- Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to\\nelectrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (see mechanical filter and RF MEMS).\\n\\n- Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter; with frequencies between and . This broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimeter wave) bands, and various sources use different boundaries. In all cases, microwaves include the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum, with RF engineering often restricting the range between 1 and 100 GHz (300 and 3 mm). Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by their IEEE radar band designations: S, C, X, K, K, or K band, or by similar NATO or EU designations.\\n\\n- In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-, and gamma radiation.\\n\\n- In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon.\\n\\n- A radar speed gun (also radar gun and speed gun) is a device used to measure the speed of moving objects. It is used in law-enforcement to measure the speed of moving vehicles and is often used in professional spectator sport, for things such as the measurement of bowling speeds in cricket, speed of pitched baseballs, athletes and tennis serves.\\n\\n- Electronics is the science of controlling electrical energy electrically, in which the electrons have a fundamental role. Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, associated passive electrical components, and interconnection technologies. Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit.\\n\\n- Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension (formally denoted or , but more often simply as \\"V\\" or \\"U\\", for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's laws) is the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge. The voltage between two points is equal to the work done per unit of charge against a static electric field to move the test charge between two points and is measured in units of \\"volts\\" (a joule per coulomb).\\n\\n- In electronics and telecommunications a transmitter or radio transmitter is an electronic device which generates a radio frequency alternating current. When a connected antenna is excited by this alternating current, the antenna emits radio waves.\\n\\n- In parabolic antennas such as satellite dishes , a feedhorn ( or feed horn ) is a small horn antenna used to convey radio waves between the transmitter and / or receiver and the parabolic reflector . In transmitting antennas , it is connected to the transmitter and converts the radio frequency alternating current from the transmitter to radio waves and feeds them to the rest of the antenna , which focuses them into a beam . In receiving antennas , incoming radio waves are gathered and focused by the antenna 's reflector on the feed horn , which converts them to a tiny radio frequency voltage which is amplified by the receiver . Feed horns are used mainly at microwave ( SHF ) and higher frequencies . The feedhorn also selects the polarization of the waves to be received , which helps to attenuate unwanted signals from adjacent channels and transponders , and from other communications satellites at nearby orbital positions . This can be either horizontal or vertical if the polarization is linear , or clockwise or counterclockwise ( also called left - and right - handed ) if it is circular . Certain devices can also allow a feedhorn to accept both linear and circular , though these cause a slight insertion loss to all incoming signals . When used with a parabolic reflector or lens antenna , the phase center of the horn is usually placed at the focal point of the reflector , with the 3 dB points of the horn 's radiation pattern set to be at the edge of the reflector . On a satellite dish , the feedhorn is what is mounted at the end of a mast from the center of the dish , or on tripod legs mounted to the edge of the dish . In satellite dishes , part of the receiver electronics , the RF front end , is usually mounted in a box just behind the feed horn . This converts the high satellite microwave downlink frequencies to a lower frequency so it can be more easily sent through the coaxial cable feedline to the receiver inside the building . This is called the low - noise blockconverter ( LNB ) , and the unit...\\n\\n- In electromagnetics, directivity is a parameter of an antenna or optical system which measures the degree to which the radiation emitted is concentrated in a single direction. It measures the power density the antenna radiates in the direction of its strongest emission, versus the power density radiated by an ideal isotropic radiator (which emits uniformly in all directions) radiating the same total power.\\n\\n- A parabolic (or paraboloid or paraboloidal) reflector (or dish or mirror) is a reflective surface used to collect or project energy such as light, sound, or radio waves. Its shape is part of a circular paraboloid, that is, the surface generated by a parabola revolving around its axis. The parabolic reflector transforms an incoming plane wave traveling along the axis into a spherical wave converging toward the focus. Conversely, a spherical wave generated by a point source placed in the focus is reflected into a plane wave propagating as a collimated beam along the axis.\\n\\n- Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. \\n\\n- In the physics of wave propagation, a plane wave (also spelled planewave) is a wave whose wavefronts (surfaces of constant phase) are infinite parallel planes. Mathematically a plane wave takes the form \\nin which the arbitrary (scalar or vector) function formula_2 gives the variation of the wave's amplitude, and the fixed unit vector formula_3 is the wave's direction of propagation.\\nThe solutions in formula_4 of \\ncomprise the plane with normal vector formula_6. Thus, the points of equal field value of formula_7 always form a plane in space. This plane then shifts with time formula_8, along the direction of propagation formula_6 with velocity \\"c\\". \\n\\n- In radio engineering and telecommunications, standing wave ratio (SWR) is a measure of impedance matching of loads to the characteristic impedance of a transmission line or waveguide. Impedance mismatches result in standing waves along the transmission line, and SWR is defined as the ratio of the partial standing wave's amplitude at an antinode (maximum) to the amplitude at a node (minimum) along the line.\\n\\n- Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.\\n\\n- Data transmission, digital transmission or digital communications is the transfer of data (a digital bit stream or a digitized analog signal) over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels are copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication channels, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal. \\n\\n- A satellite dish is a dish-shaped type of parabolic antenna designed to receive electromagnetic signals from satellites, which transmit data transmissions or broadcasts, such as satellite television.\\n\\n- A parabolic antenna is an antenna that uses a parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is that it has high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, that is, they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.\\n\\n- A Microwave radiometer (MWR) is a radiometer that measures energy emitted at sub-millimetre-to-centimetre wavelengths (at frequencies of 11000 GHz) known as microwaves. Microwave radiometers are very sensitive receivers designed to measure thermal electromagnetic radiation emitted by atmospheric gases. They are usually equipped with multiple receiving channels in order to derive the characteristic emission spectrum of the atmosphere or extraterrestrial objects. Microwave radiometers are utilized in a variety of environmental and engineering applications, including weather forecasting, climate monitoring, radio astronomy and radio propagation studies.\\n\\n- Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\".\\n\\n- A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound waves. They enable a signal to propagate with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two. This is a similar effect to waves of water constrained within a canal, or why guns have barrels that restrict hot gas expansion to maximize energy transfer to their bullets. Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, signals will typically be radiated and decreased according to the inverse square law as they expand into three dimensional space.\\n\\n- A flashlight (often called a torch outside North America) is a portable hand-held electric light. Usually, the source of the light is an incandescent light bulb or light-emitting diode (LED). A typical flashlight consists of a light bulb mounted in a reflector, a transparent cover (sometimes combined with a lens) to protect the light source and reflector, a battery, and a switch. These are supported and protected by a case.\\n\\n- Satellite television is  according to \\"article 1.39\\" of the International Telecommunication Unions (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR)  a \\"Broadcasting-satellite service\\".\\n\\n- A mechanical filter is a signal processing filter usually used in place of an electronic filter at radio frequencies. Its purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic filter: to pass a range of signal frequencies, but to block others. The filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal. At the input and output of the filter, transducers convert the electrical signal into, and then back from, these mechanical vibrations.\\n\\n- In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. \\"Wave motion\\" transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumthat is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations.\\n\\n- Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed.\\nRadar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a paraboloid is a quadric surface of special kind. There are two kinds of paraboloids: elliptic and hyperbolic.\\n\\n\\n\\n'feed horn' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'use'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- communication\\n - construction\\n - data transmission\\n - engineering\\n - impedance matching\\n - light source\\n - mass\\n - mathematics\\n - military\\n - navy\\n - optical system\\n - radar\\n - radio\\n - science\\n - service\\n - spaceflight\\n - square\\n - storage\\n - telecommunication\\n - tennis\\n - tension\\n - transmitter\\n - transport\\n - travel\\n - wave propagation","target":"impedance matching","rationale":"The given information describes a feed horn, which is used to convey radio waves between the transmitter and / or receiver and the parabolic reflector.

The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate.\\nShostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"..., what would be the answer ?","target":"Shostakovich","rationale":"The question asks for the last name of a composer who was suicidal.

Based on these details from the text, it can be inferred that Dmitri Shostakovich is likely being referred to by the author's description of a suicidal artist who joined the Communist Party in 1960 or 1961: therefore making him most probably 'the' person whose last name could best fulfill this answer choice - which would then be 'Shostakovitch'."},{"source":"Problem: Solve -1013 = 10*m - 913 for m.\\nAnd the answer is...","target":"-10","rationale":"We need to isolate the variable m on one side of the equation.\\n\\n[STEP 1] -1013 + 913 = 10*m\\n[STEP 2] -100 = 10*m\\n[STEP 3] (-1)*(-100) / (10)  = m, or 100/10=m is also correct.
