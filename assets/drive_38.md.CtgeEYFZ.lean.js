She steps in and beats up the bully to help the victim, a boy she likes. But instead of being grateful, he feels humiliated at being rescued \\"by a girl,\\" and gets angry at her. She promptly punches him in the nose and then sulks alone in the playground. Fast-forward to the present day, and Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is an FBI Special Agent. In the middle of an operation against Russian mobsters, the target starts to choke on some food, and Gracie disobeys her superior's command in order to prevent the target from choking. As a result, a member of her squad gets shot, and she is reprimanded by being reassigned to a desk job. Soon afterwards, the bureau learns that there has been a bomb threat against the 75th annual Miss United States beauty pageant in San Antonio, Texas, which the bureau determines came from the notorious domestic terrorist known as \\"The Citizen\\". Gracie's partner, Special Agent Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt), is chosen to lead the mission to prevent the attack. Despite Eric's position as a lead agent in charge, it is apparent that Gracie is the more capable agent, as Eric is unsure of how to proceed and takes credit for Gracie's suggestions. One of Gracie's suggestions is to put an agent undercover at the pageant. Gracie's male colleagues then proceed to have a bit of fun running the digital images of female and male agents through a website meant for children to play dress up with their dolls. Despite the immature and chauvinistic actions of the agents, Eric recognizes that Gracie is the female FBI agent best qualified for the undercover job. Beauty pageant coach Victor Melling (Michael Caine), whose reputation was ruined after his last contestant criticized his methods, teaches the tomboyish Gracie how to dress, walk, and act like a contestant. She is not used to such behavior, however, and sees the pageant and its participants as \\"antifeminist \\". Eventually though Victor and Gracie come to respect each other's strengths. Representing New Jersey as \\"Gracie Lou Freebush\\", Gracie impresses the audience by playing the glass harp and demonstrating self-defense techniques during the talent competition. She also unexpectedly becomes friends with the other contestants, in particular Miss Rhode Island, Cheryl Frasier (Heather Burns) Several suspects emerge, including the corrupt competition director and former pageant winner Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen); her unpleasant assistant Frank Tobin (Steve Monroe); the veteran pageant MC Stan Fields (William Shatner) who, like Kathy, is being replaced with a younger person; and last but not least Cheryl, who appears to have a history as a radical animal rights activist. While Gracie takes Cheryl and some of the other girls out partying, in an attempt to seek out more information about Cheryl's past through \\"girl talk\\", The Citizen is arrested elsewhere on an unrelated charge. After hearing what some of the other contestants said about Kathy Morningside's past (she won the pageant only after the original winner \\"mysteriously\\" contracted food poisoning), Gracie begins to suspect her, and is worried about the safety of the girls. Her boss thinks that her suspicions are groundless and that the pageant is out of danger now that the Citizen has been arrested. He calls off the mission. Gracie opts to turn in her badge and gun and continue the investigation alone. Eric initially fails to support Gracie and is about to return to the bureau when he figures out that Gracie's suspicions must be correct, and returns to help her. In the final round of the pageant, Gracie earns 1st Runner up while Cheryl becomes Miss United States. Gracie realizes that Kathy Morningside and Frank Tobin unknown to anyone (except Victor) is Kathy's son impersonated \\"The Citizen\\" and made the threat.

Joanna was thus nicknamed \\"la Beltraneja\\", as a mocking reference to her assumed father. Pressure from members of the nobility forced the King to strip her of the title and name his half-brother Alfonso as heir, in 1464.

Left ventricular shape is most dramatically deranged at end-systole and early diastole, suggesting the possibility that the distribution of left ventricular diastolic filling might be altered. To investigate this hypothesis, nine patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and nine normal individuals were studied with echocardiographic techniques. Left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time was significantly prolonged in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension by comparison with normal individuals (129 +/- 36 versus 53 +/- 9 ms, p less than 0.005) and the fraction of the transmitral flow velocity integral occurring in the first half of diastole was significantly less than in normal individuals (38 +/- 14% versus 70 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). Measurement of fractional changes in short-axis left ventricular cavity area similarly demonstrated that in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension fractional early diastolic cavity expansion (32 +/- 11%) was significantly less than in normal individuals (78 +/- 9%, p less than 0.005). In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the ventricular septum was abnormally flattened toward the left ventricular cavity at end-systole (normalized septal curvature 0.04 +/- 0.19) and remained that way throughout early diastolic filling but returned toward normal at end-diastole (normalized septal curvature 0.68 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides information about a study that compared left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time, transmitral flow velocity integral, changes in short-axis left ventricular cavity area, and normalized septal curvature between patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and normal individuals.

Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.; \\n\\nQuestion: How can the sand get rid of excess copper? \\n\\nIs this question answerable?","target":"no","rationale":"The context is a scientific explanation of how copper functions in the human body.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work.

Passage 1:Richardson was born at Quarndon, Derbyshire. He was educated at Winchester College and in a match against Harrow School scored 117 for the Winchester XI in a partnership of 295. At the start of the 1928 season he made his debut for Derbyshire against the West Indies. In his first three seasons he managed a highest score of 70 and his best seasonal average was 25. He became Derbyshire captain in the 1931 season and led his team to 7th in the points table. In the 1932 season he scored 1,258 runs with an average of 29.95 and made his highest score of 90 against Nottinghamshire, although the team fell back to 10th in the Championship. He led the team progressively up to sixth in the 1933 season, third in the 1934 season, and second in the 1935 season with 16 wins. In the 1936 season the club won the County Championship winning 13 matches. He was supported by batsmen Stan Worthington, Leslie Townsend, Denis Smith and Albert Alderman each of whom scored over a thousand runs and several centuries. Bill Copson, Tommy Mitchell, Alf Pope and Leslie Townsend accounted for most of the wickets taken. Richardson finished his cricket career at the end of the 1936 season. Wisden stated that he achieved much by his own enthusiasm and warm personality.\\n Passage 2:The Challenge Cup ties was arranged to be played at the Excelsior Stadium, Airdrie but due to the fact Airdrie United hadn't completed laying their artificial turf, The SFL granted Airdrie the permission to move the venue to Clackmannanshire side Alloa Athletic's stadium Recreation Park, because of its synthetic pitch. (Alloa were playing away to Dundee in the Cup). A week after, Ayr United made the way up to Elgin, for the first time since July 1979. Ayr scored first, then Elgin scored two quick goals. Aaron Connelly scored the first goal of his career. Elgin City scored 40 seconds before the tie went to penalties. After two defeats in both the Co-Operative cup and league Ayr had a second round tie with, First Division side, Cowdenbeath, in which Ayr ran out surprise winners. However Ayr were knocked out in the next round by Glasgow Club Partick Thistle. As November approached Ayr entered the Scottish Cup and faced Aberdeen Junior team, Sunnybank. A game that Ayr easily won 5-0 with goals from loan-signing Stuart Bannigan, two goals from the Penalty spot, A header and a sublime over-head kick from Andy Rodgers. An Away draw against SPL side, Hibernian awaited Ayr. Ayr drew 0-0 in the Capital. But were victorious in a replay.

Marius Honorius (Ken Stott) faces impending capture by the invading Saxons, led by their king Cerdic (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) and his son Cynric (Til Schweiger).

It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book.\\n\\nThe real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.  According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \\"in Lennon's blood\\".  Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, and said he began the script to try to understand \\"how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art.

If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar.

Most previous works focus on the case with a single manifold. However, in practice it is quite common that the optimization problem involves more than one constraints, (each constraint corresponding to one manifold). It is not clear in general how to optimize on multiple manifolds effectively and provably especially when the intersection of multiple manifolds is not a manifold or cannot be easily calculated. We propose a unified algorithm framework to handle the optimization on multiple manifolds. Specifically,  we integrate information from multiple manifolds and move along an ensemble direction by viewing the information from each manifold as a drift and adding them together. We prove the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms. We also apply the algorithms into  training neural network with batch normalization layers and achieve preferable empirical results.","target":"This paper introduces an algorithm to handle optimization problem with multiple constraints under vision of manifold","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nThis paper introduces an algorithm to handle optimization problem with multiple constraints under vision of manifold."},{"source":"The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful.

Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

The earliest pictures were painted by people who hunted animals. They used to paint pictures of the animals they wanted to catch and kill. Pictures of this kind have been found on the walls of caves in France and Spain. No one knows why they were painted there. Perhaps the painters thought that their pictures would help them to catch these animals. Or perhaps human beings have always wanted to tell stories according to pictures.\\nAbout 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians and other people in the Near East began to use pictures as kind of writing. They drew simple pictures or signs to represent things and ideas, and also to represent the sounds of their language. The signs these people used became a kind of alphabet.\\nThe Egyptians used to record information and to tell stories by putting picture writing and pictures together. When an important person died, scenes and stories from his life were painted and carved on the walls of the place where he was buried. Some of these pictures are like modern comic strip stories. It has been said that Egypt is the home of the comic strip. But, for the Egyptians, pictures still had magic power. So they did not try to make their way of writing simple. The ordinary people could not understand it.\\nBy the year 1,000 BC, people who lived in the area around the Mediterranean Sea had developed a simpler system of writing. The signs they used were very easy to write, and there were fewer of them than in the Egyptian system. This was because each sign, or letter, represented only one sound in their language. The Greeks developed this system and formed the letters of the Greek alphabet. The Romans copied the idea, and the Roman alphabet is now used all over the world.\\nThese days, we can write down a story, or record information, without using pictures.

The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...","target":"Mary","rationale":"The answer is Mary"},{"source":"What is the question to: \\"In a PVC, the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood, which means that circulation is inefficient.\\"?

Spleen cells from these mice have decreased NK-1.1+ cells and null (Thy-1- and B220-) cells. Their splenic NK activity to YAC targets was low and was not enhanced by IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. Bone marrow (BM) of these NK-1.1(-) mice have normal precursors to NK cells: 1) NK activity could be generated from NK-1.1(-) BM cells cultured in rIL 2 for 5 to 6 days. These cultured BM cells expressed Qa-5, Thy-1, AsGm-1, and NK-1.1 antigens. The precursor cells of these BM cytotoxic cells are NK-1.1-; 2) transfer of BM cells from the NK-1.1(-) mice reconstituted the NK activity of irradiated, NK-depleted recipients. Lymphokine-activated killer cells could also be generated from spleens of these NK-1.1(-) mice. Therefore, the NK-1.1(-) mice were specifically depleted of mature cytotoxic NK cells, but not the NK-1.1- precursors of NK cells.

Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection.\\nThe setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter.

She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom.

M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine.

Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money....\\nWhen did design thinking begin to be a thing?\\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\\n\\nA. in the early 60's\\n\\nB. not enough information\\n\\nC.

He attended Wake Forest University for two years of college basketball, where he helped the Demon Deacons achieve their first-ever number one ranking. He was selected fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets, where he developed into one of the league's premier players, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting in 2008. During the 2011 offseason, Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, only for the transaction to be controversially voided by the NBA. Later that summer, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers instead. Behind Paul's playmaking, the Clippers developed a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, earning them the nickname \\"Lob City\\". In 2017, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, and helped the team win a franchise-record 65 games in his debut season. He was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Russell Westbrook on July 16, 2019.\\n Passage 2:Guardigli was born in Ravenna. At 18 he enrolled in and attended the School of Fine Arts of Ravenna. During World War II he was drafted and served from 1943 until 1946 in the Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) at La Spezia). After the war he returned to the School of Fine Arts, receiving his diploma in 1948. He enrolled in the School of Painting and Mosaics, also in Ravenna, graduating in 1951. From 1951 to 1955 he worked with the Gruppo mosaicisti of Ravenna and restored many mosaics. Also in 1951, at the end of November, he arrived in Paris to teach at the Ecole d'Art Italien (School of Italian Art) as an assistant to the painter Gino Severini, founder and director of the school. Together with another mosaicist, his fellow Ravennan Lino Melano, he executed mosaic works for artists including Fernand Léger, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Jean Bazaine, and Raoul Ubac. He collaborated also on the mosaic for the façade of the Musée national Fernand Léger in Biot (Alpes-Maritimes). In 1960 he executed, at the Colombe d'Or of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, a mosaic by the painter Georges Braque. From 1961 he had a studio in the artists' residence La Ruche at 2, passage de Dantzing in Paris, the place described by Lorenzo Viani in the book Parigi 1925 (Paris 1925), published by Fratelli Treves. In 1962, in another collaboration with Braque, he created the famous long fish tank of the Fondation Maeght in St Paul de Vence. His collaborations with many illustrious artists continued; the last was Jean-Michel Folon. Many of his personal works in painting and mosaics are in prominent private and public collections. The latter portion of his life was spent in an old people's rest home in Paris, where he died in 2008.\\n Passage 3:Wheaton remained in command of the brigade during Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign in 1864, as well as during the subsequent Siege of Petersburg. His men were hurried by train to Washington, D.C., in time to help repel Jubal Early's raid on the capital. During the ensuing operations in the Shenandoah Valley, under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, Wheaton was promoted to command of the first division after Brig. Gen. David Allen Russell was killed at the Third Battle of Winchester. His division fought well in subsequent battles. In the Battle of Sailors Creek Virginia, on April 6, 1865, his division captured Confederate Major General George Washington Custis Lee, son of Robert E. Lee. After the return of VI Corps to the Petersburg front, Wheaton earned the brevet rank of major general in the volunteer army and was brevetted colonel in the regular services.","target":"3","rationale":"The question specifically asks for the year in which Wheaton commanded a brigade, so only Passage 3 contains appropriate information."},{"source":"Given a text passage as input comprising of dialogue of negotiations between a seller and a buyer about the sale of an item, your task is to classify the item being sold into exactly one of these categories: 'housing', 'furniture', 'bike', 'phone', 'car', 'electronics'.

Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

Both of these systems use a two-stage filtration process, in which fluid and waste products are first extracted and these are filtered again to re-absorb any re-usable materials while dumping toxic and spent materials as urine. The difference is that protonephridia combine both filtration stages in the same organ, while metanephridia perform only the second filtration and rely on other mechanisms for the first – in annelids special filter cells in the walls of the blood vessels let fluids and other small molecules pass into the coelomic fluid, where it circulates to the metanephridia. In annelids the points at which fluid enters the protonephridia or metanephridia are on the forward side of a septum while the second-stage filter and the nephridiopore (exit opening in the body wall) are in the following segment. As a result, the hindmost segment (before the growth zone and pygidium) has no structure that extracts its wastes, as there is no following segment to filter and discharge them, while the first segment contains an extraction structure that passes wastes to the second, but does not contain the structures that re-filter and discharge urine.","target":"blood vessels","rationale":"The context mentions that annelids with blood vessels use metanephridia to remove soluble waste products.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459).

Passage 1:Thirty-five of the listed players have played for only one franchise. Four of those players played exclusively for the Montreal Canadiens and five played for the Detroit Red Wings, those teams having the most such players. The record for most teams played for by a player who has competed in over 1,000 games is held by Mike Sillinger, who played for 12 teams in his career; Sillinger played his 1,000th game with his 12th and final NHL team, the New York Islanders. Patrick Roy, Martin Brodeur and Roberto Luongo are the only goaltenders with at least 1,000 games played. Roy spent his career with the Montreal Canadiens and the Colorado Avalanche while Brodeur played for the New Jersey Devils and his final seven games with the St. Louis Blues.

The draft was held on June 9, 1978, before the 1978–79 season. In this draft, 22 NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. The first two picks in the draft belonged to the teams that finished last in each conference, with the order determined by a coin flip. The Indiana Pacers won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the Kansas City Kings, who obtained the New Jersey Nets' first-round pick in a trade, were awarded the second pick. The Pacers then traded the first pick to the Portland Trail Blazers before the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season. A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection. If a player left college early, he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated. Before the draft, five college underclassmen were declared eligible for selection under the \\"hardship\\" rule. These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier. Prior to the start of the season, the Buffalo Braves relocated to San Diego and became the San Diego Clippers. The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 202 players.\\n Passage 3:Heughan was born on 30 April 1980 in Balmaclellan, in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.

Moving to Edinburgh at the age of twelve, he attended James Gillespie's High School for a year and then moved to the Edinburgh Rudolf Steiner School until the end of the sixth year. He subsequently spent two years working and travelling, before enrolling at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) in Glasgow, graduating in 2003. During his schooling, he performed in numerous plays, including The Twits at Citizens Theatre, an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime & Punishment, Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, Aeschylus' Greek tragedy Prometheus Bound, and Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.

They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write.\\nWe recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts.\\nWe did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use.\\n1. They “time-block” their writing in advance\\nScheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week.\\nWhat seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful.\\n“When I need to write I block out time.

One muscle, the extensor digitorum communis, is abnormal in most patients with this disease, but to obtain the maximum diagnostic sensitivity, it may be necessary to examine other muscles, especially ones that are more involved clinically. There is no one muscle that will be more abnormal in every patient with MG. The muscle(s) to be tested must be selected based on the distribution of weakness in the individual patient. Abnormal jitter is also seen in diseases of nerve and muscle; these diseases must be excluded by other electrophysiologic and clinical examinations before diagnosing MG. If neuronal or myopathic disease is present, increased jitter does not indicate that MG is also present. However, if jitter is normal in a muscle with definite weakness, the weakness is not due to MG. When abnormal neuromuscular transmission has been demonstrated by repetitive nerve stimulation, the finding of abnormal jitter does not add to the diagnosis, though it may be useful in providing baseline values for comparison with the results of subsequent studies. SFEMG is most valuable clinically in the patient with suspected MG in whom other tests of neuromuscular transmission and antiacetylcholine receptor antibody titers are normal. Serial measurements of jitter can be useful in following the course of disease and in assessing the effect of treatment, but the results from these studies must always be interpreted in light of the overall clinical picture. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes various percentages and statistics, such as \\"99%\\", \\"abnormal in most patients\\", etc. So the answer is “Yes”."},{"source":"Given a part of privacy policy text, classify it into one of these categories: \\n (1) First Party Collection/Use (how and why a service provider collects user information), \\n (2) Third Party Sharing/Collection (how user information may be shared with or collected by third parties), \\n (3) User Choice/Control (choices and control options available to users), \\n (4) User Access, Edit, & Deletion (if and how users may access, edit, or delete their information), \\n (5) Data Retention (how long user information is stored), \\n (6) Data Security (how user information is protected), \\n (7) Policy Change (if and how users will be informed about changes to the privacy policy).\\n\\nUsers with accounts can delete their account (with the company or organization removing all data), within the scope of unspecified user information.","target":"User Access, Edit and Deletion","rationale":"The passage states that the user information will be deleted.

Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure.

The 7 EV71 cases involving brainstem encephalitis plus pulmonary edema had a significantly lower phytohemagglutinin stimulation index than other cases (p ϭ 0.04). After EV71 stimulation of peripheral mononuclear cells, there was a significant increase in cellular Th1 cytokine (␥interferon) and proinflammatroy cytokines. However, cases with pulmonary edema had significantly lower cellular ␥-interferon (p ϭ 0.04), lower cellular IL-1␤ (p ϭ 0.04), lower cellular IL-6 (p ϭ 0.04), lower cellular tumor necrosis factor-␣ response (p ϭ 0.04), and lower cellular macrophage inflammatory protein-1␣ (p ϭ 0.04) response compared with other cases.

Increasingly, employers are looking for individuals who are not only competent and intelligent, but who have different skill sets and who are knowledgeable in many areas. Part of the appeal to employers is that your extra work demonstrates a willingness to take on difficult tasks. Additionally, if your majors overlap  , you are able to show potential employers that you have both _ and depth of knowledge.\\nBy studying for a double major, although you will be studying for only one degree, you will be focusing on two related and integrated subjects that complement   each other. Classes overlap between the majors, meaning fewer classes are required than with a double degree, so it is easier to finish within four years.\\nIn contrast, with the more rigorous   double degree, you will be studying for two different degrees in two completely different areas of study. Although pursuing such a course    of study allows students to complete two wholly separate degrees in less time than if they  were to earn them separately, many strong students still find it incredibly difficult to complete in four or five years.\\nIf you are committed to a double major/degree, it is wise to do a little bit of planning. Some students try to find two courses of studies that are related, while others seek to round out their academic studies by choosing two completely unrelated fields.\\nFor double majors, common pairings include: (i) economics and a foreign language; (ii) political science or government and journalism; (iii) economics and psychology.\\nFor double degrees, common pairings include: (i) engineering and a business program such as finance or accounting; (ii) engineering and economics.\\nOptions:\\nA find two subjects with overlapping classes\\nB learn about what your potential employers want\\nC decide what to learn with your intentions considered\\nD try to decide on some common pairings as soon as possible\\nAnswer:\\nC decide what to learn with your intentions considered\\nQuestion:","target":"If you are devoted to a double major or degree, you should   _  .","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"If you are devoted to a double major or degree, you should   _  ."},{"source":"Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year.\\n\\nTwo geology students had an exam on plate tectonics.

Eighty-one (90%) did not require blood transfusion in the immediate postoperative period; nine patients received 16 units of blood, 6 of whom bled excessively; 2 were re-explored. Twelve had post-operative haemoglobins below 8.5 G/dl during their stay. They were transfused a total of 28 units of blood before discharge. Post-operative blood loss in the 9 transfused early averaged 894 +/- 176 ml (SEM). Loss from the not transfused patients averaged 481 +/- 18 ml (p less than 0.001). Patients transfused later had a mean loss of 510 +/- 36 ml (P NS). Sixty-nine patients were not transfused. Haemoglobin on the first post-operative day was 11.3 +/- 1.3 G/dl (SD). This declined to 10.2 +/- 1.2 G/dl on the fifth day. Discharge haemoglobin was 10.5 +/- 1.2 G/dl. Two patients died, one of myocardial infarction on the third day and the other of pancreatitis on the fourth. Both had had early blood transfusion. Haemoglobins were above 10 G/dl. Of the 69 untransfused patients 17% had supraventricular arrhythmias. Ten percent had serous wound discharges; 3 were infected. There were no sternal dehiscences.

By 1928, she was playing starring roles, achieving success in MGM's first talkie release, Alias Jimmy Valentine (1928) opposite William Haines, Lionel Barrymore, and Karl Dane. The following year, she appeared in the popular murder mystery The Thirteenth Chair, a role that offered her the chance to display her dramatic abilities as a murder suspect.

Stravinsky worked under the guidance of Rimsky-Korsakov, having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts. By the time of his mentor's death in 1908 Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a Piano Sonata in F♯ minor (1903–04), a Symphony in E♭ major (1907), which he catalogued as \\"Opus 1\\", and a short orchestral piece, Feu d'artifice (\\"Fireworks\\", composed in 1908).In 1909 Feu d'artifice was performed at a concert in St. Petersburg. Among those in the audience was the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who at that time was planning to introduce Russian music and art to western audiences. Like Stravinsky, Diaghilev had initially studied law, but had gravitated via journalism into the theatrical world. In 1907 he began his theatrical career by presenting five concerts in Paris; in the following year he introduced Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov. In 1909, still in Paris, he launched the Ballets Russes, initially with Borodin's Polovtsian Dances from Prince Igor and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade. To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer Michel Fokine, the designer Léon Bakst and the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky. Diaghilev's intention, however, was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th-century style, and he was looking for fresh compositional talent. Having heard Feu d'artifice he approached Stravinsky, initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by Chopin to create the ballet Les Sylphides.

Chaos ensued.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI go on many public Discord servers purely to share and discuss art that I or others have made. It's absolute bliss to know that people appreciate and would love to get art from me.\\n\\nHowever, one specific server that I had joined recently irked me. I wasn't particularly in with the general userbase and not very many were involved with the art community and the general etiquette. Regardless, I posted a work in progress of my art, hoping for a few bits of appreciation or discussion.\\n\\nOne user (let's call him Poe) comes in and tells me minutes after that my art was cool. Poe likes it, and wants to save it. Normally I'd be fine if it were a trustworthy server, but something about Poe's approach just really... creeped me out. It's quite hard to describe it without sounding hostile. It gave out red flags that I'd noted down as the general characteristics of an art thief. Deciding it's better safe than sorry, I left him hanging, deleted my art, and left the server altogether (also due to how ticked off I got with the userbase.) As an artist who's had to bust art thieves, it feels awful to just think about being in that situation.\\n\\nWhile I was done with directly interacting with that server, my friends (who still were inside just to watch how things went down) kept sending screenshots of daily events they found funny. Over the course of the next two or so days the occasional Poe-asking-to-do-X-with-art screenshot came up. Examples included Poe asking artists if he could digitalize their art (in the same creepy manner), which only reaffirmed my paranoia. Today, my friends told of how some people gave a user some critique on their art. Poe had basically told them their opinion was invalid because they weren't artists.\\n\\nThat was the last straw.\\n\\nI wanted to give my two cents on his statement, so I joined again, never intending to post any media.

I told him that while he might have been genuinely trying to be nice, it horrendously backfired on him. Poe then goes into complete damage control and says it was a joke, and to not be triggered. (I'm not quite sure how responding calmly is being triggered either.)\\n\\nSoon enough, it turned into a full scale argument. Poe's friends argued points that seemed real iffy to me.

At first, Poe denied being creepy and suspicious, but eventually acknowledged that he had behaved inappropriately.

He added that it \\"jumps right out of the speakers at you\\". Rolling Stone magazine's John Swenson believed the interplay among the three vocalists was one of the album's most pleasing elements; he stated, \\"Despite the interminable delay in finishing the record, Rumours proves that the success of Fleetwood Mac was no fluke.\\" In a review for The New York Times, John Rockwell said the album is \\"a delightful disk, and one hopes the public thinks so, too\\", while Dave Marsh of the St. Petersburg Times claimed the songs are \\"as grandly glossy as anything right now\\". Robert Hilburn was less receptive and called Rumours a \\"frustratingly uneven\\" record in his review for the Los Angeles Times, while Juan Rodriguez of The Gazette suggested that, while the music is \\"crisper and clearer\\", Fleetwood Mac's ideas are \\"slightly more muddled\\". The album finished fourth in The Village Voice's 1977 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregated the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave Rumours five stars and noted that, regardless of the voyeuristic element, the record was \\"an unparalleled blockbuster\\" because of the music's quality; he concluded, \\"Each tune, each phrase regains its raw, immediate emotional power—which is why Rumours touched a nerve upon its 1977 release, and has since transcended its era to be one of the greatest, most compelling pop albums of all time.\\" According to Slant Magazine's Barry Walsh, Fleetwood Mac drew on romantic dysfunction and personal turmoil to create a timeless, five-star record, while Andy Gill of The Independent claimed it \\"represents, along with The Eagles Greatest Hits, the high-water mark of America's Seventies rock-culture expansion, the quintessence of a counter-cultural mindset lured into coke-fuelled..., what would be the answer ?","target":"romantic dysfunction","rationale":"The article mentions that the album drew inspiration from two things: romantic dysfunction and personal turmoil.\\nSo, the answer is \\"romantic dysfunction\\""},{"source":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.\\nQuestions: They made a mess eating on the sofa bed, they dripped a tangy what sauce all over it?\\nOptions:\\n- basement\\n- guest room\\n- horseradish\\n- bathroom\\n- living room","target":"horseradish","rationale":"The question mentions a \\"sofa bed\\" which suggests that the mess was made in a guest room.

It is also referred to as an artificial or invented language. There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as: to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code), to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning, for artistic creation, and for language games.\\n\\n- Esperanto (or ; in Esperanto: ) is a constructed international auxiliary language. It is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world. The Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof published the first book detailing Esperanto, \\",\\" on 26 July 1887. The name of Esperanto derives from \\" (\\"\\" translates as \\"one who hopes\\"), the pseudonym under which Zamenhof published Unua Libro.\\n\\n- Esperanto is written in a Latin alphabet of twenty - eight letters , with upper and lower case . This is supplemented by punctuation marks and by various logograms , such as the numerals 0 -- 9 , currency signs such as $ , and mathematical symbols . Twenty - two of the letters are identical in form to letters of the English alphabet ( q , w , x , and y being omitted ) . The remaining six have diacritic marks ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  ( that is , c , g , h , j , and s circumflex , and u breve ) . The full alphabet is : In handwritten Esperanto , the diacritics pose no problem . However , since they do n't appear on standard alphanumeric keyboards , various alternate methods have been devised for representing them in printed and typed text . The original method was a set of digraphs now known as the \`\` h - system '' , but with the rise of computer word processing a so - called \`\` x-system '' has become equally popular . These systems are described below . However , with the advent of Unicode , the need for such work - arounds has lessened . Unique to the Esperanto script is the spesmilo ( 1000 specie ) sign , an Sm monogram for a now - obsolete international unit of auxiliary Esperanto currency used by a few British and Swiss banks before World War I. It has been assigned the Unicode value U +20B7 , though in ordinary fonts it is often transcribed as Sm , usually italic .\\n\\n- Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof (), usually credited as L. L. Zamenhof, was a Polish-Jewish medical doctor, inventor, and writer. He is most widely known for creating Esperanto, the most successful constructed language in the world. He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war and believed that this could happen with the help of a new international auxiliary language, which he first developed in 1873 while still in school.\\n\\n- Dr. Esperanto's International Language, usually referred to as Unua Libro, was the first publication to describe Esperanto, then called the International Language. It was first published in Russian on July 26, 1887 in Warsaw, by Polish oculist L. L. Zamenhof. Over the next few years editions were published in Polish, Russian, Hebrew, French, German, and English. This booklet included the Lord's Prayer, some Bible verses, a letter, poetry, the sixteen rules of grammar and 900 roots of vocabulary. In the book Zamenhof declared, \\"an international language, like a national one, is common property\\" and renounced all rights to the language, effectively putting it into the public domain. Zamenhof signed the work as \\"Doktoro Esperanto\\" (Doctor One-Who-Hopes). Those who learned the new language began to call it \\"Esperanto\\" after Zamenhof's pen name, and Esperanto soon became the official name of the language.\\n\\n- An international auxiliary language (sometimes abbreviated as IAL or auxlang) or interlanguage is a language meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language.

The band consisted of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. NME named the Smiths the \\"most influential artist ever\\" in a 2002 poll.\\nContext: In February 1984, the group released their debut album The Smiths, which reached number two on the UK Albums Chart. Both \\"Reel Around the Fountain\\" and \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\" met with controversy, with some tabloid newspapers alleging the songs were suggestive of paedophilia, a claim strongly denied by the group.  In March 1984, they performed on Channel 4 music programme The Tube.  The album was followed the same year by the non-album singles \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" and \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\", which featured \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" on its B-side. Securing the band's first top ten placing, \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" was also significant for marking the beginning of engineer and producer Stephen Street's long-term working relationship with the band.  More controversy followed when \\"Suffer Little Children\\", the B-side to \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\", touched on the theme of the Moors murders. This caused an uproar after the grandfather of one of the murdered children heard the song on a pub jukebox and felt the band was trying to commercialise the murders. After meeting with Morrissey, he accepted that the song was a sincere exploration of the impact of the murders. Morrissey subsequently established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, who is mentioned by name in the song.  The year ended with the compilation album Hatful of Hollow. This collected singles, B-sides and the versions of songs that had been recorded throughout the previous year for the Peel and Jensen shows.\\nQuestion: How did the Smiths come about?.

There was a non-relative woman who took her in and who became her mother figure. This quasi-MIL seemed nice to me, but behind my back, she was telling lies to her entire family, like that I never paid rent after moving in with Lara and that I only liked her because of her money. She started trying to convince my gf to leave me. Lara didn't tell me about this for months.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMIL claimed that Lara has become like her second daughter, but while she always made sure that her real daughter had enough time to study, she never gave a shit about Lara's education. Lara instead was asked to do an unappropriate amount of chores at home, that literally kept her from studying. Lara didn't even get to go to the same prestigious school as the real daughter did. Still, Lara felt thankful to have a family in them that she even paid them rent and bought their groceries in order to not be a nuisance. So these things Lara confided in me. It was her own idea to pay the rent and groceries, and she never saw anything wrong with doing all the chores. She never noticed how weird it all was.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter months of MIL's campaign against me, Lara had a long conversation with her quasi-mother, telling her she'll spend the rest of her life with me, and if MIL doesn't accept that, she'll only play a minor role in the life of her future quasi-grandchildren. From then on, our relationship improved a little.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThen, a friend told me what had been happening behind my back prior to my gf's conversation with MIL (which I didn't know about). It sounded like it was still going on. I asked Lara about it, and she confirmed that MIL had said and done all these things. I wrote MIL and told her I knew about her trying to split us up, and about the rent lies. I said that she's a hypocrite to say that because she didn't treat Lara like a second daughter, she treated her like a slave.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter my rant, MIL just blocked my number and sent Lara screenshots. Lara was angry , she said that the arguments I used were things that never had bothered her herself. Also, she told me about the conversation she had had with MIL, and that our relationship had improved so much already, and that I had destroyed that. MIL went low contact with Lara until a small unrelated fight, when she broke off all contact. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSometimes I wonder if I should just have not said anything at all to MIL and just not have come along anymore when Lara visited her.

They are dying because they are losing a great deal of habitat due to human incursion and global warming.  They are dying because of starvation as well.  With the sea ice they depend on for survival shrinking, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find food.\\nAn ecosystem is highly dependent on all of its parts, and removing even a single species can result in serious consequences.  Polar bears are at the top of the predators where they live.  They play an important part in the ecosystem.  They feed on seals, fish and deer.  Several other animals depend on the kill of polar bears.  The failure to save polar bears might result in loss of these predators.\\nIn addition, all large predators perform a very important function in their habitat: helping to control the populations of other species.  When an animal group loses its natural predators, its population will rise rapidly, having a direct result in population decrease of other groups.  A huge boom in population of Arctic seals would have a direct effect on the prey  of seals, and could reduce numbers of certain types of fish.\\nThis could also have a direct effect on humans, who might have to compete with Arctic seals for food supplies from fish. Lack of polar bears could eventually affect human food supply. Human beings shall save polar bears to ensure the food supply.\\nThere is no doubt that we should save polar bears.  However, there is still another question: can they be saved? This is a matter that scientists debate because of rapid degradation of the polar bear' environment in recent years due to warming temperatures.

In December 1917, Lenin was under intense pressure from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk and the Bolsheviks' rule was in crisis, with an inexperienced administration and the demoralised army facing powerful political and military opponents. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could fight for central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud's delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917. By the beginning of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognised Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they waited and monitored the relations between Finland and Germany , hoping to override Lenin's regime and to get Russia back into the war against the German Empire. In turn, the Germans hastened Finland's separation from Russia so as to move the country to within their sphere of influence.\\nHow many countries recognized Finnish independence by the beginning of the Civil War?","target":"8","rationale":"By the beginning of Civil War, Finland was recognized by 8 countries: Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany , Greece , Norway Sweden and Switzerland."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a list of integers and an integer k.

It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad.

Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049.\\nAnderton and Agatha go to Crow's apartment as the 36-hour time nears, finding numerous photos of children, including Sean's. Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him to be a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it. Crow however begs to be killed, having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family's financial well being. Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger, killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha's drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha, but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively's existence and her connection to Agatha.\\nWitwer, studying Crow's death, suspects Anderton is being framed. He examines the footage of Lively's murder and finds there were two attempts on her life, the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second, occurring minutes later, having succeeded. Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess, but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton's gun. With the Precogs still offline, the murder is not detected.\\nLara calls Burgess to reveal that Anderton is with her, and Anderton is captured, accused of both murders, and fitted with the brain device that puts him permanently into a dreamlike sleep. As his body is deposited into the prison, the warden tells him, \\"that all your dreams come true. \\nAgatha is reconnected to the PreCrime system. While attempting to comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains that as he could not afford to let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.\\nAfter Burgess's death, the PreCrime system is shut down and all prisoners pardoned. Anderton and Lara are soon to have a new child together. The Precogs are sent to an isolated island to live their lives in peace.","target":"What does Anderton do to keep from being recognized by the city wide opitcal recognition program?","rationale":"Here's an example of a good question: What does Anderton do to keep from being recognized by the city wide opitcal recognition program?

One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and thus too old to enlist.\\n\\nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966. She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.  After Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes, he championed H.J.Res. 341, a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion to commodore by special Presidential appointment. She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy's few female admirals.  Following a career that spanned more than 42 years, Admiral Hopper took mandatory retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986. At a celebration held in Boston on the USS Constitution to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.  At the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days). (Admirals William D. Leahy, Chester W. Nimitz, Hyman G. Rickover and Charles Stewart were the only other officers in the Navy's history to serve on active duty at a higher age.

As Prussian troops evacuated Samogitia, the Teutonic Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania on 6 August 1409. The Knights hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania separately and began by invading Greater Poland and Kuyavia, catching the Poles by surprise. The Knights burned the castle at Dobrin , captured Bobrowniki after a fourteen-day siege, conquered Bydgoszcz , and sacked several towns. The Poles organized counterattacks and recaptured Bydgoszcz. The Samogitians attacked Memel . However, neither side was ready for a full-scale war. Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, agreed to mediate the dispute. A truce was signed on 8 October 1409; it was set to expire on 24 June 1410. Both sides used this time for preparations for the battle, gathering the troops and engaging in diplomatic maneuvers. Both sides sent letters and envoys accusing each other of various wrongdoings and threats to Christendom. Wenceslaus, who received a gift of 60,000 florins from the Knights, declared that Samogitia rightfully belonged to the Knights and only Dobrzyń Land should be returned to Poland. The Knights also paid 300,000 ducats to Sigismund of Hungary, who had ambitions for the principality of Moldova, for his military assistance. Sigismund attempted to break the Polish-Lithuanian alliance by offering Vytautas a king's crown; Vytautas's acceptance of such a crown would violate the terms of the Ostrów Agreement and create Polish-Lithuanian discord.

Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December.\\nWar's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US.

The Secretary of State for India, St John Brodrick, had in fact expressed the need for it to be \\"within the power of the Tibetans to pay\\" and given Younghusband a free hand to be \\"guided by circumstances in this matter\\". Younghusband raised the indemnity demanded from 5,900,000 to 7,500,000 rupees, and further demanded the right for a British trade agent, based at Gyantse, to visit Lhasa \\"for consultations\\". It seems that he was still following Lord Curzon's geo-political agenda to extend British influence in Tibet by securing the Chumbi Valley for Britain.  Younghusband wanted the payment to be met by yearly instalments; it would have taken about 75 years for the Tibetans to clear their debt, and since British occupation of the Chumbi valley was surety until payment was completed, the valley would remain in British hands. Younghusband wrote to his wife immediately after the signing; \\"I have got Chumbi for 75 years. I have got Russia out for ever\\". The regent commented that \\"When one has known the scorpion  the frog  is divine\\". The Amban later publicly repudiated the treaty, while Britain announced that it still accepted Chinese claims of authority over Tibet. Acting Viceroy Lord Ampthill reduced the indemnity by two-thirds and considerably eased the terms in other ways. The provisions of this 1904 treaty were revised in the Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1906.

The main protein components of chromatin are histones and other proteins, which bind to DNA and help package it into a smaller volume to fit in the cell. Since there are millions of base pairs in human chromosomes, the DNA is wound around histone proteins to condense it, forming nucleosomes. Because histones have a positive charge at their tail ends, they can interact with negatively charged phosphate groups on DNA molecules through ionic bonds. Thus, when a negatively charged molecule such as methylphosphate binds covalently to some of these lysine residues that carry positive charge on histone tail ends in chromatin structure (a process known as post-translational modification), it neutralizes their charges; so they are not able to bind with the negatively charged DNA any more and separate from it. Therefore option 4 (The histones would separate from the DNA) best fits this description.\\"\\""},{"source":"Answer the following question:\\n\\nprohibition was successful in reducing the consumption of alcohol and it was not until which decade?","target":"1920 to 1933","rationale":"Prohibition was enacted in the United States on January 17, 1920 with the ratification of Amendment XVIII. \\nThe amendment went into effect a year later and prohibited \\"the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from\\" America for beverage purposes.

Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface.   The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).  Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which continent experienced more hurricanes?","target":"Lemuria","rationale":"The two continents in the situation are separated by a large ocean, and Lemuria experiences natural disasters. Hurricanes form over oceans with warm water (at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit), specifically tropical waters that have low wind shear levels.\\nGiven these conditions, it is most likely for hurricanes to occur on an island continent surrounded by a large ocean, such as Lemuria. Oceania has milder weather and did not experience common weather phenomena like hurricanes or other natural disasters mentioned in the background information. It would be unlikely for hurricanes to hit Oceania due its location between North America and Asia; any hurricane traveling from South America towards Japan would go through mainland United States first."},{"source":"I read this background article the other day: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

The Eagles looked to improve to 8-1 for the first time since 2004 as they took on the Denver Broncos. The Broncos named Brock Osweiler as their starting quarterback, replacing Trevor Siemian. The Broncos took their only lead of the game on an opening drive that resulted with a Brandon McManus 53 yard field goal. Despite missing tight end Zach Ertz who was out with a hamstring injury, the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat. On their opening drive of the game, Carson Wentz faked a handoff to newly acquired running back Jay Ajayi, and found Alshon Jeffery wide open for a 32-yard touchdown down the right sideline. Later in the first quarter, slot cornerback Patrick Robinson picked off Brock Osweiler on an intended pass to Demaryius Thomas, setting up a Corey Clement 15 yard touchdown reception, on a screen pass. The Eagles responded to another Brandon McManus field goal with a 27-yard touchdown connection between Wentz and tight end Trey Burton. Following McManus' third field goal of the first half, Jay Ajayi found the end zone for the first time with the Eagles, with a 46-yard touchdown run to close the first half. The Eagles led 31-9 at half time, and following a third quarter touchdown run by Corey Clement and touchdown reception by Alshon Jeffery, the Eagles led 44-9. The final score was 51-23, which was virtually a mirror of their last meeting in 2013, and Corey Clement finished the day with three touchdowns (two rushing, one receiving). With the win, the Eagles went into the bye week with the best start since 2004. They had also surpassed their win total from last season where they only got 7 wins. Furthermore; this was the third largest victory at Lincoln Financial Field since the 54-11 win over the Bears in 2013 and the largest victory in the Doug Pederson era.\\nWho made three same plays in the first half","target":"McManus","rationale":"In order to answer the question, we need find out who made three same plays.

In space, they get to do some pretty amazing things, like floating  in zero gravity .\\nHowever, there are also plenty of things that astronauts can't do because of their weightless environment, and that's very sad. What's worse, they can't even let their sadness show, because it's impossible to cry in zero gravity.\\nOf course, astronauts can still produce tears . But crying is much more difficult in space, according to The Atlantic  in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow  down out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go -- they just stick  to your eyes.\\nIn May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this during one of his spacewalks. \\"Tears,\\" he said, \\"don't fall off of your eyes. They just stay there.\\"\\nBesides making your vision  unclear, this can also cause physical pain. Back on Earth, tears are supposed to bring comfort to the eyes. But that's not the case  in space. The space environment dries out astronauts' eyes, and when tears suddenly wet the eyes, it can cause pain rather than comfort. \\"My right eye is stinging  like crazy,\\" Feustel told his teammate during the walk.\\nSince gravity doesn't work in space, astronauts need some extra help to get rid of  the tears. Feustel chose to rub his eyes against his helmet to wipe  the tears away. Another choice is to just wait -- \\"When the tears get big enough, they simply break free of the eyes and float around,\\" astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic.\\nThere are lots of small things -- things like crying -- that we are so used to on Earth. We usually _ until they become a problem in a totally different environment, like space. There, astronauts can't talk to each other directly. They also can't eat or drink in normal ways. They can't even burp , because there is no gravity to hold the food down in their stomach. If they do burp, they just end up throwing up  everything in their stomach, according to the UK National Space Center.\\nTherefore,...\\nQuestion: What effect do tears have on astronauts?\\nOptions: A: They cause physical pain.\\nB: They bring comfort to them.\\nC: They make their vision clearer.\\nD: They float around and cause trouble.","target":"A","rationale":"The article states that the tears in space stick to astronaut's eyes, which doesn't bring comfort.

Any vitamin supplement that you and your doctor agree should be added to your diet can be taken with levothyroxine, provided that you don't take your vitamin or supplement within four hours of taking your thyroid replacement hormone. Before taking this medicine. Levothyroxine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems. Since thyroid hormone occurs naturally in the body, almost anyone can take levothyroxine. However, you may not be able to take this medicine if you have certain medical conditions. Tell your doctor if you have: Make sure to separate levothyroxine and antacids or gas-relieving medications by at least four hours. Antidepressant Medications Combining levothyroxine with some antidepressants may change the amount of levothyroxine your body needs, and your healthcare provider may need to adjust your levothyroxine dosage. It is also best to take both of these medications on an empty stomach. Take omeprazole at least 30 minutes before a meal. And even though you can take penicillin VK with food, it works better if you take it with an empty stomach. ...Read more Synthroid morning routine. 1  Synthroid’s part of my morning routine. 2  Every day starts with me immediately going into the kitchen to take my medication and drink water. 3  My morning routine starts with Synthroid. 4  I get up and I reach for the Synthroid and my water. 5  It’s 7:30 am and I’m getting up, and on the shelf are my medications. No soy no iron: Although the packaging for levothyroxine says to take it on an empty stomach for many people its not possible to do that and take it consistently each day. As long as you take it at a consistent time and don't take it with soy or with iron which will interfere with its absorption it is fine to take it with breakfast or before bed without being strictly fasting. Antacids often used to treat heartburn and other intestinal distress, including calcium products such as TUMS or ROLAIDS and other antacids, may have absorption-inhibiting effects on thyroid medications. People should take levothyroxine four to six hours before or after taking these antacids.

From 1974 to 1984, she starred as Laura Ingalls Wilder, the daughter of Charles Ingalls (played by Michael Landon) on the NBC series Little House on the Prairie. During the run of Little House, Gilbert appeared in several popular television films, including The Diary of Anne Frank and The Miracle Worker.\\n\\nAfter her break up with Rob Lowe, Gilbert left for New York City to star in the play A Shayna Maidel. Gilbert was set up with actor Bo Brinkman, a cousin of actors Randy Quaid and Dennis Quaid. The couple married on February 22, 1988, only seven weeks after her relationship with Rob Lowe ended. Gilbert became pregnant months later. On May 1, 1989, she gave birth to son Dakota Paul Brinkman. They divorced in 1992.  Only weeks after Gilbert's divorce filing, Bruce Boxleitner's former wife, Kathryn Holcomb, set Boxleitner up with Gilbert. Holcomb by then was married to actor Ian Ogilvy. Gilbert had met Boxleitner as a teenager when they both were on Battle of the Network Stars when Gilbert introduced herself, and she had a pin-up of him in her locker. But Boxleitner ignored her because she was a teen and he was many years older than she was. After reconnecting, the couple started dating on and off for over a year. They were engaged twice and Boxleitner broke up with her each time. After reuniting for a third time, they finally married on January 1, 1995, in her mother's living room. Gilbert quickly became pregnant, but went into premature labor more than two months before her due date. She gave birth to a son, Michael Garrett Boxleitner, named in honor of Michael Landon, on October 6, 1995. His middle name is in honor of Garrett Peckinpah, her friend Sandy Peckinpah's son, who had died suddenly of meningitis at age 16.

Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \\"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down\\".

The latter function involves reversing the post-translational modification of cellular proteins conjugated with either ubiquitin (Ub) or Ub-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). Ub is known to be highly conserved among eukaryotes, but surprisingly, ISG15 is highly divergent among animals. The ramifications of this sequence divergence to the recognition of ISG15 by coronavirus PLPs at a structural and biochemical level are poorly understood. Therefore, the activity of PLPs from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus was evaluated against seven ISG15s originating from an assortment of animal species susceptible, and not, to certain coronavirus infections. Excitingly, our kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural analysis revealed an array of different preferences among PLPs. Included in these studies is the first insight into a coronavirus PLP's interface with ISG15 via SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with the principle binding domain of human ISG15 (hISG15) and mouse ISG15s (mISG15s). The first X-ray structure of the full-length mISG15 protein is also reported and highlights a unique, twisted hinge region of ISG15 that is not conserved in hISG15, suggesting a potential role in differential recognition. Taken together, this new information provides a structural and biochemical understanding of the distinct specificities among coronavirus PLPs observed and addresses a critical gap of how PLPs can interact with ISG15s from a wide variety of species. \\n Title: Structural Insights into the Interaction of Coronavirus Papain-Like Proteases and Interferon-Stimulated Gene Product 15 from Different Species","target":"False","rationale":"The paragraph describes the function of PLPs in coronaviruses, which include their ability to process viral polyproteins and antagonize host innate immunity.

Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum.

She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives.\\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\\nThat’s right, you STOP!\\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\\nThis isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).\\nQuestion: After writing this book, Dr. Nagoski became:\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. famous\\n\\nB. homeless\\n\\nC. not enough information\\n\\nD. depressed","target":"A","rationale":"Dr. Nagoski wrote a book titled “Come As You Are”, which was discussed in the context of this question.

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century \\nBased on the previous passage, Could Madame White Snake live out a normal life with her mate, why or why not? \\nIs \\"No, because of her dangerous sexuality\\" a correct answer?","target":"Yes","rationale":"Yes, Madame White Snake could live out a normal life with her mate. This is because she has taken on the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife (mentioned in paragraph 3), which includes love and care for family. Given this transformation into a positive character, there's no reason why she can't live out a happy life with her human husband. No one mentions that sexuality influences whether or not she deserves to be punished--the fact that it was mentioned at all may just mean that people thought it would make their stories more interesting!"},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the  records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the American conservator John Brealey, to remove a \\"yellow veil\\" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.

Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and isolated mountains, the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75 years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.Wind can also cause plants damage through sand abrasion. Strong winds...\\n\\nParagraph: John was studying plant varieties in different regions. He fist visited the Pacific Northwest. He found that the wind was constantly very strong there.

Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?'

Passage:Jiang Ji (died 18 May 249), courtesy name Zitong, was an official and military general of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, Jiang Ji started his career as a low-level official in his native Yang Province before becoming a subordinate of Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the central government towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. After the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, he served in the state of Cao Wei through the reigns of the first three emperors – Cao Pi, Cao Rui and Cao Fang – and held various appointments in the military before rising to Grand Commandant, one of the top positions in the central government. During his service in Wei, he was known for being candid in giving advice to the emperor on various issues, including consolidating power, halting labour-intensive construction projects, and officials' abuses of power. In February 249, he joined the regent Sima Yi in staging a successful coup d'état against his co-regent Cao Shuang, but died from illness a few months later.\\n Links: a. Cao Pi b. Cao Shuang c.

The answer can be inferred from the \\"Life\\" section of Jiang Ji's Wikipedia article, which says that he died in May 249 and served Cao Wei through the reigns of the first three emperors – Cao Pi, Cao Rui and Cao Fang. This means that he died during/after Emperor Cao Fang's reign, as Emperor Cao Fang was the third emperor who he served. Since it is known that Emperor Caofang lived for around 11 years after becoming emperor in 239 (he became emperor at age 7), then it can be inferred from this information alone that Emperor Caofang was one of the three emperors who Jiang Ji served and lived longer than any other because his reign lasted longer than any other among them. However, none of this information is provided directly in any of links given as answer options (a-d). In fact, these links provide little to no useful information about determining which emperor lived longest among those whom Jiang Ji served.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the first name of the person who observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural?","target":"Steve","rationale":"The context indicates that Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall.

These civilizations possessed writing, the Minoans writing in an undeciphered script known as Linear A, and the Mycenaeans in Linear B, an early form of Greek.

My grandmother has alzheimer's and it's still in the beginning stages, which makes dealing with her a little difficult. She's in her late 70s and refuses to be told how to live, even if it's good for her health. Because of insurance changed, we have had to change their doctor a couple of times. Her last three doctors have told her that she's diabetic, but she refuses to believe it and continually sites the doctor before them saying she's \\"borderline\\" only. She's actually gotten into full blown arguments with my grandfather, my mother, and myself about the fact that she has to take her medication as prescribed and the fact that her diet absolutely has to change in order to keep her healthy. I have even gone so far as to threaten her with a home (not that I could ever follow through with the threat, I was just grasping at straws). My grandfather is and has been ready to be put in a home for over a decade because he does not want to become a burden to anyone. My grandmother, on the other hand, refused to talk to me for almost two weeks just for mentioning it. Then, about eight months ago, a friend of my grandmother's moved back into town (she had been living with her son and hated it). She's on the list for section 8 housing, but jumped the gun and moved into my grandparents' house. From what my grandfather was told, she would be there two weeks, she was there three months and only left because she had to (my uncle was coming into town and my grandfather told her that they needed the space). She still takes my grandmother out all the time, and while they are out she borrows money from my grandmother with no real repayment plan in place. She also comes over a few times a week to eat dinner, completely uninvited. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSomewhere in the mix of all that (about three months ago), my grandmother started calling on her friend to take her to the doctor. I would show up to take her to appointments only to find out that she was already gone. Or I would find out, after the fact, about her going to an appointment that I didn't even know about. This is especially problematic because her friend doesn't tell us what's happening and my grandmother doesn't remember everything or just refuses to tell us about her appointments. When my mother confronted my grandparents about it, they responded by saying that I'm unreliable. Which blows my mind because until this started happening, I was always the one taking them to their appointments without fail, and I am still the one that takes my grandfather to all of his appointments. Of course, asking them how I can be considered unreliable when I don't even know about the appointment gets met with silence. So, we've officially told my grandmother that she is no longer allowed to go to the doctor without me or my mother, on at least four separate times now. I even went so far as to call her friend and tell her that she cannot take my grandmother to any appointments. Like, I don't even care if you take her shopping or whatever. That's between you and her, but no more doctors. That's my job. That was two weeks ago.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLast week, my grandmother had outpatient surgery. Her friend went with us because my grandmother had no idea where she was supposed to go and I wasn't involved in any of the planning for this surgery. There was a mass removed, which had to be sent to pathology. I set up the appointment for the results. I also set up an appointment for my grandfather's dermatologist later on the same day. That day is Monday. I woke up sick as a dog on Friday, but I have been forcing medication down my throat to get myself well enough over the weekend to not have to ask my mom to take time off work for this. Well, midday on Friday, grandma's friend calls me.  \\n\\n\\nFriend: Hey \\\\[my name\\\\]. I heard you had to go to the Social Security Office on Monday?\\n\\nMe: No...?\\n\\nFriend: Oh, well, your grandmother's appointment is on Monday.

Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, at the time of its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.\\nAlthough Watts received many offers to buy the painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it would be inappropriate not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.\\nAs cheap reproductions of Hope, and from 1908 high-quality prints, began to circulate in large quantities, it became a widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.\\nDespite the decline in Watts's popularity, Hope remained influential. Martin Luther King Jr. based a 1959 sermon, now...","target":"George","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that the painter George Watts painted a series of works titled Hope.

Greece was first unified under Philip of Macedon in the fourth century BC. His son Alexander the Great rapidly conquered much of the ancient world, spreading Greek culture and science from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus River. Annexed by Rome in the second century BC, Greece became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The first century AD saw the establishment of the Greek Orthodox Church, which shaped the modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox World. Falling under Ottoman dominion in the mid-15th century, the modern nation state of Greece emerged in 1830 following the war of independence.

The Giants took an early lead on Tynes' first-quarter field goal, but the Falcons responded with third-string running back Jason Snelling's 7-yard touchdown run. Boss caught two touchdown passes in the second quarter, one of them from 28 yards out. In the third quarter, Snelling and Jacobs traded short touchdown runs.

Finally, during the Middle Ages the vegetable made its way to Europe. At that time, eggplant was not the shiny purple vegetable most people know today. Instead, it was like a white egg.

But this year for the first time, the Council is proposing shifting more than $20 million in funds earmarked by the Mayor for 18-B lawyers to the Legal Aid Society, which would increase its total funding to $80.4 million.

Estimates place the volcano's last eruption at 46,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene.North Sister possesses more dikes than any similar Cascade peak, caused by lava intruding into pre-existing rocks. Many of these dikes were pushed aside by the intrusion of a 980-foot (300 m)-wide volcanic plug. The dikes and plug were exposed by centuries of erosion.   At one point, the volcano stood more than 11,000 feet (3,400 m) high, but erosion reduced this volume by a quarter to a third. The plug is now exposed and forms North Sister's summits at Prouty Peak and the South Horn.","target":"46,000 years ago","rationale":"The article mentions that the last eruption of North Sister was 46,000 years ago."},{"source":"You are given a short poem which is written by a kid.

He was one of the most popular American rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, with the Belmonts or with the Del Satins. He is best remembered for the singles \\"Runaround Sue\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", \\"Ruby Baby\\" and \\"Lovers Who Wander\\", among his other hits.\\n\\nBob and Gene Schwartz also signed Dion's friends, the Belmonts, (Carlo Mastrangelo, Fred Milano, and Angelo D'Aleo), a vocal group named for nearby Belmont Avenue, and teamed them, with Dion singing lead. The new group's breakthrough came in early 1958, when \\"I Wonder Why\\" (on their newly formed \\"Laurie\\" label) made No. 22 on the U.S. charts. Dion said of the Belmonts; \\"I'd give 'em sounds. I'd give 'em parts and stuff. That's what 'I Wonder Why' was about. We kind of invented this percussive rhythmic sound. If you listen to that song, everybody was doing something different. There's four guys, one guy was doing bass, I was singing lead, one guy's going 'ooh wah ooh,' and another guy's doing tenor. It was totally amazing. When I listen to it today, oftentimes I think, 'man, those kids are talented.'\\"  Their initial hit was followed by \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Don't Pity Me,\\" which also charted the Billboard Top 100. This success won a place for Dion and the Belmonts on the ill-fated \\"The Winter Dance Party\\" tour with Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson), Frankie Sardo, and other performers. On February 3, 1959, after a concert stop in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly and others decided to charter a flight to the next venue rather than travel on the tour bus. Dion was invited to accompany the group but decided that he did not want to spend $36 for the flight, as it was the same monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment and he couldn't justify the indulgence. The plane crashed, killing all on board; Holly, Valens, Richardson, and the pilot Roger Peterson. Dion and the Belmonts continued on the tour, along with Frankie Sardo, while Bobby Vee, then an unknown artist, performed in Holly's place at the very next concert. Later, Jimmy Clanton, Frankie Avalon, and Fabian were added to replace the other now-deceased headliners.  Dion and the Belmonts' next single, \\"A Teenager in Love,\\" was released in March 1959, eventually hitting No. 5 on the U.S. pop charts and No. 28 in the UK. The group's biggest hit, \\"Where or When,\\" was released in November of that year, and reached No. 3 on the U.S. charts. However, in early 1960, Dion checked into hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens. Further single releases for the group that year were less successful. There were musical, personal and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960, Dion decided to quit for a solo career.

Developmental delay, intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorders, BDMR syndrome, and unusual facial morphology are the key features of the chromosome 2q37 microdeletion syndrome. A genetic screening for two brothers with global developmental delay using high-resolution chromosomal analysis and subtelomeric multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed subtelomeric rearrangements on the same sites of 2q37.2 and 7q35, with reversed deletion and duplication. Both of them showed dysmorphic facial features, severe disability of physical and intellectual development, and abnormal genitalia with differential abnormalities in their phenotypes. The family did not have abnormal genetic phenotypes. According to the genetic analysis of their parents, adjacent-1 segregation from their mother's was suggested as a mechanism of their gene mutation.

Passage:The game's history can be traced back to 2005, when Goichi Suda and Shinji Mikami (creator of the Resident Evil series) became good friends while working together on Killer7. Suda wanted to make a survival horror game exclusively for the PlayStation 3. With his first horror title  receiving decent sales in Japan by 2006, Suda immediately began working on Kurayami (Japanese for 'Darkness') in his spare time. It was at one time thought to be called \\"Closer\\". However, EA later confirmed that name had been abandoned for another title. By the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2006, a publisher for Kurayami had not yet been established. In 2008, Suda presented the game's concept to EA Games, who agreed to license the Unreal Engine 3 and to publish the game to a worldwide audience. Shinji Mikami was then invited to executive-produce the project. Suda wanted to announce the game at E3 2009, but was not allowed to do so, due to a media silence agreement between Grasshopper Manufacture and EA Games. That December, Akira Yamaoka (sound designer for the Silent Hill series) left Konami after finishing his work on  and joined Grasshopper Manufacture because he enjoyed the latter's game No More Heroes. Yamaoka began work as the sound designer for the game. The game went about five different versions until Electronics Arts approved it. The newly titled Shadows of the Damned was finally unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in 2010 as an action game.\\n Links: a. Goichi Suda b. Unreal Engine c. Akira Yamaoka d.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.”\\nLarisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

Enzymes interact with a substrate by means of strain or distortions, moving the substrate towards the transition state. Transition state analogs can be used as inhibitors in enzyme-catalyzed reactions by blocking the active site of the enzyme. Theory suggests that enzyme inhibitors which resembled the transition state structure would bind more tightly to the enzyme than the actual substrate.

Passage 1:The original catalyst for development was the ill-fated vanity project by Lord Kensington (died 1852) which consisted of the two-mile conversion of the insanitary Counter's Creek into the Kensington Canal (1826 onwards), followed by its eventual replacement first by \\"Mr Punch's railway\\", opened in 1844 and next, by the Metropolitan District Railway in 1865–69, which eventually became London Underground's District Line and was joined after 1907 by the Piccadilly line. Meanwhile, the congestion apparent in London and Middlesex for burials at the start of the century was causing public concern not least on health grounds. In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground on the edge of Earl's Court in an outlying area of Brompton. The moving spirit behind the project was the engineer, Stephen Geary. It was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the proposal. Securing the land – some 40 acres – from local landowner, Lord Kensington and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge. After two years the cemetery was duly established by Act of Parliament and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. It was consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London in June 1840, and is now one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries, served by the adjacent West Brompton station.\\n Passage 2:Bonko first sought political office in the 1995 municipal election, when he was elected to the Board of Edmonton Public Schools as trustee for Ward A. He was re-elected in the 1998 and 2001 elections. He did not seek re-election at the conclusion of his third term. Instead, he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in Edmonton Decore in the 2004 provincial election as a Liberal. He won 44.63% of the vote and defeated his opponents, who included former MLA Walter Szwender who was running for the Progressive Conservatives and Gary Masyk, an incumbent MLA whose riding had been abolished and who had crossed the floor to become the Alberta Alliance's first MLA after being elected as PC. He did not sponsor any bills during his time in the legislature, and was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Janice Sarich in the 2008 election.\\n Passage 3:With the outbreak of the Civil War, Weed was promoted captain of the newly formed Battery I, 5th U.S. Artillery in May 1861. He remained at Camp Curtin in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, training his crews until the spring of 1862, when they served in the Peninsula Campaign and at Second Bull Run. He commanded his battery during the fierce artillery duel at Antietam. Promoted to command of all the artillery of the V Corps, his guns were in action at the Battle of Fredericksburg. From December 1862 through January 1863, he was stationed at Falmouth, Virginia. After a short leave of absence, he took part in the Battle of Chancellorsville, commanding the artillery of the 2nd Division, V Corps. On June 6, 1863, Weed left the regular army artillery to accept a commission as a brigadier general in the volunteer army.

Tom tilled his land, while Brad applied the no-till gardening method.\\n\\nWhich farmer had a soil that took less to warm in spring?\\n\\nHint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage.

Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.","target":"planet B","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere.

Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work. According to The Times: \\"Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from Bowie\\". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \\"parting gift\\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \\"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day.

In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest.
