When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.\\n\\nGuess a valid title for it!","target":"Adrian Boult","rationale":"The text is about the life and work of Adrian Boult, an English conductor."},{"source":"There are MORE hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere during which season?\\n\\nOptions:\\n- spring\\n- summer\\n- fall\\n- winter","target":"summer","rationale":"- The total number of hours in a season is the same regardless of hemisphere. \\n- However, due to Earth's tilt on its axis and elliptical orbit around the sun, there are more hours of daylight during summer than winter (and vice versa). \\nThus, this question is asking which season has more sunlight: Summer or Winter?"},{"source":"I can use this background: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver.

This phenomenon is not demonstrable in normal spontaneous conceptions. The hCG curves of 151 singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of two, three, and four embryos therefore were compared statistically with the hCG curves of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of only one embryo. The hCG levels of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of more than one embryo had statistically higher hCG levels at 7 and 8, 19 and 20, and 37 and 38 days after ET. In a separate evaluation it was observed that declines in hCG levels of normal singleton IVF pregnancies preceded four of five first-trimester abortion incidence peaks of singleton IVF pregnancies. The observed cyclic hCG secretion may be indicative of early embryo deaths. This observation supports the contention that multiple ET results in significantly more multiple implantations than previously appreciated. Thus embryo survival in utero may represent another major contributory factor to success or failure of IVF. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides numerical data, such as the number of embryos transferred and statistics regarding the change in hCG levels at different time points during pregnancy.

We keep cool in hot weather by evaporating sweat from our skin and water from our breathing passages. Because evaporation is inhibited by high humidity, we feel hotter at a given temperature when the humidity is high. Low humidity, on the other hand, can cause discomfort from excessive drying of mucous membranes and can lead to an increased risk of respiratory infections. When we say humidity, we really mean relative humidity. Relative humidity tells us how much water vapor is in the air compared with the maximum possible. At its maximum, denoted as saturation, the relative humidity is 100%, and evaporation is inhibited. The amount of water vapor in the air depends on temperature. For example, relative humidity rises in the evening, as air temperature declines, sometimes reaching the dew point. At the dew point temperature, relative humidity is 100%, and fog may result from the condensation of water droplets if they are small enough to stay in suspension. Conversely, if you wish to dry something (perhaps your hair), it is more effective to blow hot air over it rather than cold air, because, among other things, the increase in temperature increases the energy of the molecules, so the rate of evaporation increases. The amount of water vapor in the air depends on the vapor pressure of water. The liquid and solid phases are continuously giving off vapor because some of the molecules have high enough speeds to enter the gas phase; see Figure 13.33(a). If a lid is placed over the container, as in Figure 13.33(b), evaporation continues, increasing the pressure, until sufficient vapor has built up for condensation to balance evaporation. Then equilibrium has been achieved, and the vapor pressure is equal to the partial pressure of water in the container. Vapor pressure increases with temperature because molecular speeds are higher as temperature increases. Table 13.5 gives representative values of water vapor pressure over a range of temperatures.\\n\\n\\nQ: What happens to the level of relative humidity in the evening as air temperature declines?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- it goes up and down\\n\\n- it falls\\n\\n- nothing\\n\\n- it rises\\n\\nA:","target":"it rises","rationale":"The explanation here is that \\"the evening, as air temperature declines\\".

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull.

Does this then enhance pathogen emergence? Interactions between pathogens are often mediated by the hosts immune system [1] . Two recent experimental papers suggest that interactions between the immune system and corticosterone may be important in mediating synergistic interactions between pathogens that enhance rates of co-infection in birds. As part of a long term study on the effect of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum in house finches Haemorhous mexicanus, Dana Hawley and her team asked the question to what extent are the stress hormones that are important for energy mobilization and regulation of the immune system influenced by experimental infection with the bacterium M. gallisepticum [2] . They found that corticosterone levels increased after house finches were infected with M. gallisepticum, decreased again to pre-infection levels once the infection was cleared, and that individuals with greater disease severity had the highest corticosterone concentrations. Trying to identify factors that influence West Nile virus transmission, Lynn Martin and his team started from the premise that stress hormones might represent a key link between individual-level of infection, population-levels of parasite transmission, and zoonotic disease risk. They experimentally manipulated zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata stress hormones by implanting corticosterone-filled silastic tubules and examined subsequent feeding preferences, feeding success, and productivity of mosquito vectors [3] .

The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal.

There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans. Further offshoots include the first-language English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans, Zambians, Swazilanders and Namibians.\\n\\n- Canadian English (CanE, CE, en-CA) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada. According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.\\n\\n- British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"\\n\\n- International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and between nations. It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts.\\n\\n- Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\\nRights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\".\\n\\n- The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. John Locke defined freedom under the rule of law as follows:\\n\\n- Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"\\n\\n- Human rights are moral principles or norms, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \\"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,\\" and which are \\"inherent in all human beings\\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.\\n\\n- A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'occupation' with 'human rights activist'.","target":"kalmen kaplansky","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"kalmen kaplansky\\"."},{"source":"Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist?\\n\\nWe need to be in frequent contact with the clients.\\nOPTIONS:\\n- unacceptable\\n- acceptable","target":"acceptable","rationale":"This sentence follows the subject-verb-object structure.

The 24-h secretory profile of GH was generated by 20-min sampling in 10 young women (aged 18-33 yr), 10 young men (aged 18-33 yr), 8 postmenopausal women (aged greater than 55 yr), and 8 older men (aged greater than 55 yr). A computer-assisted pulse analysis program was used to assess both total GH secretion, as reflected in the 24-h integrated GH concentration (IGHC), and pulsatile secretion, as denoted by pulse frequency, duration, amplitude, and the fraction of GH secreted in pulses during the 24-h period (FGHP). IGHC was significantly greater in women than in men (P less than 0.025) and greater in the young than in the old (P less than 0.003). The mean pulse amplitude, duration, and FGHP were each greater in the young (P less than 0.006, P less than 0.03, and P less than 0.0001, respectively), but not significantly different between the sexes. The mean pulse frequency was not affected by sex or age. The serum concentration of free estradiol, but not free testosterone, correlated with IGHC (r = 0.46; P less than 0.005), pulse amplitude (r = 0.53; P less than 0.001), and FGHP (r = 0.59; P less than 0.0002). After correcting for the effects of estradiol, neither sex nor age influenced IGHC or mean pulse amplitude, while the effect of age on FGHP was reduced from 81% to 29%. Of the indices of GH secretion, FGHP had the strongest correlation (r = 0.43; P less than 0.006) with somatomedin-C. Somatomedin-C declined significantly with age in both sexes. Our results indicate that sex and age have independent and interrelated effects on GH secretion. These effects can be largely accounted for by corresponding variations in endogenous estradiol levels. These observations suggest an amplifying action of estradiol on the neuroendocrine regulation of pulsatile GH release.","target":"Effects of sex and age on the 24-hour profile of growth hormone secretion in man: importance of endogenous estradiol concentrations","rationale":"The abstract provides information about a study of the effects of sex and age on growth hormone (GH) secretion in men.

Shortly after his birth, the family moved from Rockford, to Ithaca, New York where his father worked with a law firm. Howard attended Ithaca Academy. An interest in insect collecting encouraged by his parents with the gift of The Butterfly Hunters by Mary Treat at the age of 10 followed by more books and at the age of 13, along with another collector friend, recorded the introduction of the European cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) in the Catskill region. Along with his friends, he founded the Ithaca Natural History Society to meet and discuss papers and insects. While out collecting one day, he met John Henry Comstock, who invited him to his lab at Cornell University. Howard enrolled in Cornell in September 1873, three years after the death of his father, and following the advice of his mother's friends, went to study civil engineering. Doing poorly in differential calculus made him drop engineering and he began to study other subjects including French, German, and Italian. He then joined Comstock's lab as the first research student and graduated in June 1877 with a thesis on respiration in the larva of Corydalis cornutus. He worked with Burt Green Wilder and Simon Henry Gage and received a masters at Cornell.

A 43-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos an early lead, but the Bengals countered in the second quarter, with a 28-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. The Broncos responded, with a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Eric Decker.

His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewuÃte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation).

Vikings cornerback Josh Robinson was penalized on the onside kick that followed for touching the ball before it had gone 10 yards, allowing the Packers to run down the clock before Crosby slotted another field goal, this time from 45 yards. Inside the two-minute warning, Ponder threw an incompletion on fourth down, only for Tramon Williams to again be penalized for pass interference against Patterson, allowing Ponder the opportunity for a 19-yard touchdown run two plays later. The Vikings were unable to recover the onside kick, and Green Bay knelt out the clock for a 44-31 win.\\n\\nHow many total points were there at the half?","target":"41","rationale":"Before answering the question, we need to check how many points there were in each quarter.

This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position.

To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop.

He wrote scores mostly for television series up until 1995, in which he wrote a few of the cues for the animated Disney motion picture A Goofy Movie. He continued to score television series until the two then young directors, the Wachowskis, hired him to score their neo-noir film Bound. It was reasonably successful at the box office. Bound was the film which led Davis into becoming the composer for the entire Matrix trilogy. Subsequently, Davis has composed scores for films such as Jurassic Park III (recommended to the filmmakers by John Williams, the composer of the scores for the first two films in the series), House on Haunted Hill, Behind Enemy Lines, and The Unsaid.

There are few side trips to cultural comments.\\" Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times stated, \\"As a film, 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen' is a good concert. For much of the picture's 114 minutes, the camera is on Joe Cocker, by most standards the best and most exciting singer in rock music ... But 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen,' unfortunately, fails in the end to rise above this interesting, but clearly limited historical summary of the Cocker tour. As a film, it doesn't establish its own importance.\\" A negative review by Tom Zito of The Washington Post advised readers to \\"Forget the film and try the record,\\" explaining, \\"What emerges from all this is roughly two hours of footage that looks terrible on the screen and sounds almost as bad.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.\\nFrom the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World WarÂ II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World WarÂ II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.\\n\\n- The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.\\n\\n- The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.\\n\\n- Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces, police, intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex.\\n\\n- A field officer, field grade officer, or senior officer is an army, marine, or air force commissioned officer senior in rank to a company officer but junior to a general officer. In most armies this corresponds to the ranks of major, lieutenant colonel and colonel, or their equivalents. Some countries also include brigadier in the definition.\\n\\n- The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.\\n\\n- The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large.\\n\\n- Major is a military rank of commissioned officer status, with corresponding ranks existing in many military forces throughout the world. When used unhyphenated, in conjunction with no other indicators, Major is one rank senior to that of an army Captain, and one rank subordinate or below the rank of Lieutenant colonel. It is considered the most junior of the field officer ranks.\\n\\n- Thomas Buchanan McGuire , Jr. ( August 1 , 1920 -- January 7 , 1945 ) was a United States Army major who was killed in action while serving as a member of the Army Air Forces during World War II and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . He was one of the most decorated American fighter pilots and the second highest scoring American ace of the war . McGuire was memorialized by the renaming of Fort Dix Army Air Force Base in Burlington County , New Jersey , to McGuire Air Force Base in 1948 .\\n\\n- The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790.\\n\\n- An army (from Latin \\"arma\\" \\"arms, weapons\\" via Old French \\"armÃ©e\\", \\"armed\\" (feminine)) or ground force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include other branches of the military such as the air force via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. They differ from army reserves who are activated only during such times as war or natural disasters.\\n\\n- The Army of the United States or Armies of the United States is the legal name of the \\"land forces of the United States\\" (United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001) and has been used in this context since at least 1841, as in the title: \\"General Regulations for the Army of the United States\\". The Army, or Armies of the United States includes: the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve, (as well as any volunteer or conscripted forces). \\n\\n- The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.\\n\\n- A fighter pilot is a military aviator trained to engage in air-to-air combat while in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft.

After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of Blackpool, in 1932 he was signed by First Division Manchester City, with whom he played his entire professional career. Swift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2-1 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season.\\n\\nDuring the Second World War, Swift continued to play regularly for City, making 134 wartime league appearances. He also joined the British Army, and was one several professional footballers to enlist at the Army School of Physical Training as part of a scheme devised by the FA. The school was based near Aldershot F.C. leading Swift to become one of several notable players to guest for the club. Others included Matt Busby, Jimmy Hagan, Joe Mercer, Stan Cullis, Cliff Britton and Tommy Lawton. He also guested for several other clubs during the war including Liverpool. He also played for several representative sides. On 30 October 1943 at Ninian Park, Swift played for a Western Command XI against a Cardiff City XI which featured Lawton and Mercer as guests. The game was a fundraiser for Royal Artillery prisoners of war. In April 1944 in Edinburgh he played for a British Army XI that included Jack Rowley, Leslie Compton, Cullis, Mercer, Hagan and Lawton and against a Royal Air Force XI that included Peter Doherty, Stanley Matthews and Ted Drake. The Army won 4-0. On 9 September 1944 at Windsor Park he played for a Combined Services XI in an 8-4 win against Ireland. This team was in effect a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Busby, Matthews, Lawton, Mullen, Raich Carter and Stan Mortensen. In the same year he also represented an FA Services XI in games against France and Belgium. In May 1945 Swift also travelled with a British Army XI on a European tour.  In the first season after the Second World War, Manchester City won the Second Division championship to secure their return to the top flight. In the process Swift kept a club record 17 clean sheets in 35 appearances, a mark which was not surpassed until nearly 40 years later, when Alex Williams broke the record by keeping 20 clean sheets in 1985.  By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but was still performing well enough to maintain his place in the England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire at the end of the 1948-49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Frank Swift","rationale":"In the given text, Frank Swift is described as an English footballer.

Coming to prominence while a member of Count Basie's orchestra, Young was one of the most influential players on his instrument. In contrast to many of his hard-driving peers, Young played with a relaxed, cool tone and used sophisticated harmonies, using what one critic called \\"a free-floating style, wheeling and diving like a gull, banking with low, funky riffs that pleased dancers and listeners alike\\". Known for his hip, introverted style, he invented or popularized much of the hipster jargon which came to be associated with the music.\\n\\nIn 1933 Young settled in Kansas City, where after playing briefly in several bands, he rose to prominence with Count Basie. His playing in the Basie band was characterized by a relaxed style which contrasted sharply with the more forceful approach of Coleman Hawkins, the dominant tenor sax player of the day. One of Young's key influences was Frank Trumbauer, who came to prominence in the 1920s with Paul Whiteman and played the C-melody saxophone (between the alto and tenor in pitch).  Young left the Basie band to replace Hawkins in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra. He soon left Henderson to play in the Andy Kirk band (for six months) before returning to Basie. While with Basie, Young made small-group recordings for Milt Gabler's Commodore Records, The Kansas City Sessions. Although they were recorded in New York (in 1938, with a reunion in 1944), they are named after the group, the Kansas City Seven, and comprised Buck Clayton, Dicky Wells, Basie, Young, Freddie Green, Rodney Richardson, and Jo Jones. Young played clarinet as well as tenor in these sessions. Young is described as playing the clarinet in a \\"liquid, nervous style.\\"  As well as the Kansas City Sessions, his clarinet work from 1938-39 is documented on recordings with Basie, Billie Holiday, Basie small groups, and the organist Glenn Hardman. Billie and Lester met at a Harlem jam session in the early 30s and worked together in the Count Basie band and in nightclubs on New York's 52nd St. At one point Lester moved into the apartment Billie shared with her mother, Sadie Fagan. Holiday always insisted their relationship was strictly platonic. She gave Lester the nickname \\"Prez\\" after President Franklin Roosevelt, the \\"greatest man around\\" in Billie's mind. Playing on her name, he would call her \\"Lady Day.\\" Their famously empathetic classic recordings with Teddy Wilson date from this era.  After Young's clarinet was stolen in 1939, he abandoned the instrument until about 1957. That year Norman Granz gave him one and urged him to play it (with far different results at that stage in Young's life--see below).\\n\\nWhat other members were in the band?","target":"While with Basie, Young made small-group recordings for Milt Gabler's Commodore Records, The Kansas City Sessions.","rationale":"In the given context, the answer seems to be: While with Basie, Young made small-group recordings for Milt Gabler's Commodore Records, The Kansas City Sessions."},{"source":"Given a pair of words, generate the relation between them.

However, the association between dust and the incidence of ischemic heart diseases is unknown. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether Asian dust (AD), a windblown sand dust originating from mineral soil in China and Mongolia, is associated with the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).', 'We investigated the data regarding hospitalization because of AMI among 3068 consecutive patients from 4 AMI centers in Fukuoka, Japan, and data for AD from April 2003 to December 2010. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover design to examine the association between AD and the incidence of AMI. Using a conditional logistic regression analysis, we estimated the odds ratios of AMI associated with AD after controlling for ambient temperature and relative humidity. The occurrence of AD events 0 to 4 days before the day of admission was significantly associated with the incidence of AMI. In particular, the occurrence of AD 4 days before admission was significantly associated with the onset of AMI.\\nAnswer: These data suggest that exposure to AD a few days before symptom onset is associated with the incidence of AMI.","target":"Is desert dust a risk factor for the incidence of acute myocardial infarction in Western Japan?","rationale":"Here's an example of a good question: Is desert dust a risk factor for the incidence of acute myocardial infarction in Western Japan?.

( Photos by Bill O â Leary / The Washington Post and Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post ) Since well before the White House plan to replace Secretary of State Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo became public Thursday   Pompeo had been informally preparing to take over in Foggy Bottom   reaching out to potential candidates for positions and collecting ideas . â Pompeo is quietly looking at staff and figuring out how the department could be reorganized to be effective again  â a White House official told me . A CIA spokesman declined to comment . Pompeo has been calling around to friends and top Republican foreign policy hands and asking them to help him get ready to be America â s top diplomat   if he is ultimately chosen   two GOP foreign policy sources who are familiar with the calls said . The Trump administration denied Thursday that the White House has drawn up plans to replace Tillerson with Pompeo and then appoint Sen . Tom Cotton ( R - Ark .) to be CIA director   as first reported by the New York Times . But White House officials confirmed to me that such a plan does exist   drawn up by Chief of Staff John F . Kelly . It is still unclear if President Trump has personally approved the plan   officials said   and the timing is also uncertain . In this clip from The Washington Post ' s weekly Opinions roundup   \\" It ' s Only Thursday  \\" opinion writers Jonathan Capehart   Jo - Ann Armao and Ruth Marcus weigh in on reports that the White House is planning to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo . ( The Washington Post ) State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Kelly called Tillerson â s chief of staff   Margaret Peterlin   Thursday morning to dispute the reports . Tillerson is going about his normal business   she said   and was not rattled . â The White House statement confirmed there will be no personnel changes  â she said . â Secretary Tillerson enjoys this job   he has a lot of work to do .â Tillerson and Trump met twice Thursday . In a pool meeting with reporters   Trump answered questions about  Tillerson  simply by saying   â He â s here . Rex is here .â Several State Department officials said Thursday they were happy that  Tillerson  was leaving and hopeful that Pompeo   if selected   would give them a fresh start with the Trump administration . Morale is low in Foggy Bottom amid budget and staffing cuts   hiring freezes   a departure of top talent and scores of vacant top - level positions . Tillerson â s support on Capitol Hill has also deteriorated in recent weeks as lawmakers in both parties openly criticized his ongoing reorganization initiative . The main State Department official in charge of that effort   Maliz Beams   quit her job earlier this week .  Tillerson  has consistently denied reports  he  is considering leaving or anticipating being pushed out . This week  he  pushed back against reports the diplomatic core is in trouble . Last month    he  denied being aware of the low morale and overall discontent with  his  leadership at the State Department . â If it â s as bad as it seems to be described   I â m not seeing it   I â m not getting it  â  he  said .

There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.","target":"Greenville","rationale":"Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature; this means Greenville used a less efficient approach to fighting crime than Grayvillle (the one using the more sophisticated methods).\\nSo the answer is Greenville."},{"source":"Determine the topic of the question-answer pair. \\nQuestion: How many towns have populations greater than 30,000?;  Answer: ten; Topic:","target":"Thuringia","rationale":"The question is asking how many towns have a population greater than 30,000 people.

In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969.

She was raised on a farm near New Franklin, Missouri, the eldest girl of seven children. By five, she was singing weekends in her family's band. At the age of eight, she was struck by an automobile in front of the family home, and her legs suffered multiple fractures. Recuperating for months in a wheelchair, she continued singing to help pay her medical bills. When she was 16, she began performing at a nightclub near Columbia, Missouri, a gig that lasted two years.  Evans moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1991 to be a country music artist. She met fellow musician Craig Schelske and left Nashville with him in 1992, moving to Oregon. They married in 1993. She returned to Nashville in 1995 and began recording demos. Nashville songwriter Harlan Howard was impressed by her demo of his song \\"Tiger by the Tail\\". He decided to help her music career, leading to a signed contract with RCA Nashville.  In 1997, Evans released her debut album for RCA, Three Chords and the Truth. Although none of its three singles (\\"True Lies,\\" the title track, and \\"Shame About That\\") reached the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, the album received critical praise for its neotraditional country sound. In 1998, Evans released her second album, No Place That Far. The album's lead single, \\"Cryin' Game,\\" also failed to reach the Top 40. However, the album's second single and title track, gave Evans her first Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs chart in March 1999.

A nonprofit organization is often dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view. In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends. This is known as the non-distribution constraint. The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, particularly where the nonprofit seeks income tax exemption, charitable status and so on.\\n\\n- Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as AIDS. This stage is often also associated with weight loss.\\nHIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11Â years.\\nIn 2015 about 36.7 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 1.1 million deaths. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39Â million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemica disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.

AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11Â years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.\\n\\n- California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area.

At one pole are those who view the Federal Judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being \`\`the most separated and least checked of all branches of government.'' Indeed, federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure \`\`during good behavior,'' and their pay may \`\`not be diminished'' while they hold their position (Section 1 of Article Three). Though subject to the process of impeachment, only one Justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court Justice has been removed from office. At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch, with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government. The Supreme Court, it is noted, cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments. One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in Worcester v. Georgia. President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, \`\`John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!''; however, this alleged quotation has been disputed. Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment Brown v. Board of Education. More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the Court's order in United States v. Nixon (1974) to surrender the Watergate tapes.

Sure, there are \\"better\\" cameras for more money, but they are all twice the size/weight. I would get this camera even if I had an unlimited amount of money to spend. There is simply nothing like it. Lots of ingenius user interface elements, superb feel/handling, superb flash (both internal and external SB-400), outstanding image quality, instant response, superb viewfinder, superb LCD... I could go on. I have nothing bad to say about it, and I'm extremely picky. I thought I was going to wait for a full-frame sensor body, but when this came along, I could not wait to upgrade.The lack of a built-in focusing motor is an ADVANTAGE in my opinion. It's one reason the camera is so small and lightweight, and I believe all future Nikon lenses will have internal focusing anyway. So unless you want to use older, heavier, and slower focusing lenses for some strange reason, you'd be paying for and carrying around something you won't even use.In addition to the superb 18-55mm (i.e. 27-82.5mm) kit lens, I bought the 55-200mm VR II and 50mm F/1.8D lenses, the SB-400 external flash and a remote (3rd party off Ebay). I suspect many, many people will buy this exact set of equipment, since it's really all you'll ever need. No need for an extra battery, unless you ever go many photo-filled days without being able to recharge. Get at least two 1GB 50x (or faster) SD cards, so if one stops working (it does happen), you aren't stuck.The 55-200mm VR (i.e. 82.5-300mm) is a necessity for shooting any action/wildlife. The optical stabilization is truly awesome, and better than sensor-based stabilization (e.g. Pentax K10D, Sony Alpha) since you can see it working right through the viewfinder, making it easier to frame/focus your shot. Although the lens may seem slow (f4-5.6), don't forget that stabilization gives you an extra 2-3 stops, so it's really more like f2-2.8 (without the reduced depth of field, of course). DO NOT consider the slightly cheaper non-VR version, unless the slightly smaller size is an absolute necessity.The 50mm (i.e. 75mm) is a nice walkaround lens when you want to go as light/small as possible. It's super fast (f1.8!), allowing you to take handheld photos at night with no flash! It's also a nice portrait lens, although the 55-200 is better (75mm is a little short).The D40x is a poorer choice for the vast majority of people. The extra resolution means your photos take up more space and are slower to work with. It also has a slower max. flash sync speed (1/200 vs 1/500). If you don't know what this means, trust me, it's important, and one day you'll be really happy you have it. Since the D40's pixels are larger (less pixels in the same size sensor), there is less noise, so having ISO 100 is useless. Do you really need 10MP? Do you print larger than 16x20? Heck, do you print at all? I know I don't. Think it will give you more cropping ability? Think again. Without a super expensive lens ($1k+), the lack of sharpness and magnified distortion of the cropped image won't be as good as the uncropped 6MP of the D40. Save the $200 and use it to get the 55-200 lens, or the 50mm lens and the flash.If you're ready to move to a DSLR, take this camera for a test drive. You will most likely fall in love with it's wonderful handling, and excellent performance, as so many people have. There will be a new generation of cameras coming out this fall, so you may want to wait, although there's really nothing that can be improved upon with this camera.\\nquestion: Is it a good lcd screen?","target":"superb LCD","rationale":"The text span \\"superb LCD\\" is a direct answer to the question: Is it a good lcd screen?"},{"source":"In this task, you will be given a passage, a question and a list of single-word events identified from the passage.

Here we consider learning both an energy function and  an efficient approximate sampling mechanism for the corresponding distribution. Whereas the critic (or discriminator) in generative adversarial networks (GANs) learns to separate data and generator samples, introducing an entropy maximization regularizer on the generator can turn the interpretation of the critic into an energy function, which separates the training distribution from everything else, and thus can be used for tasks like anomaly or novelty detection. \\n\\n This paper is motivated by the older idea of sampling in latent space rather than data space because running a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) in latent space has been found to be easier and more efficient, and because a GAN-like generator can convert latent space samples to data space samples. For this purpose, we show how a Markov chain can be run in latent space whose samples can be mapped to data space, producing better samples. These samples are also used for the negative phase gradient required to estimate the log-likelihood gradient of the data space energy function. To maximize entropy at the output of the generator, we take advantage of recently introduced neural estimators of mutual information. We find that in addition to producing a useful scoring function for anomaly detection, the resulting approach produces sharp samples (like GANs) while covering the modes well, leading to high Inception and FrÃ©chet scores.","target":"We introduced entropy maximization to GANs, leading to a reinterpretation of the critic as an energy function","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe introduced entropy maximization to GANs, leading to a reinterpretation of the critic as an energy function.

In mammalian muscles, experimental denervation induces the appearance of extrajunctional acetylcholine (ACh) receptors and tetrodotoxin (TTX) resistant action potentials (AP). These denervation changes have been investigated in muscle biopsies from 10 MND patients and in 2 traumatically denervated normal human muscles. Extrajunctional ACh sensitivity was present in 113 of the 140 (73%) fibers from MND muscles studied. In 50 of 84 (70%) ACh-sensitive fibers, no TTX-resistant AP were present. The remaining fibers (30%) showed small regenerative responses. In contrast, all the traumatically denervated muscle fibers showed extrajunctional ACh sensitivity and TTX-resistant AP. Histochemical analysis of the biopsies showed no direct correlation between the frequency of ACh-sensitive fibers and that of the atrophic or normal-appearing fibers. The absence of TTX-resistant AP in ACh-sensitive fibers and its lack of correlation with the histochemical criteria of denervation suggest the presence of a state of innervation in MMD, where the motoneuron is not able to maintain its fully trophic influence on the muscle fiber membrane. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract describes an experimental study that investigated denervation changes in muscle biopsies from MND patients and from traumatically denervated normal human muscles.

However, there are also ovarian ectopic pregnancies (in which the egg never left the ovary) and abdominal ectopic pregnancies (in which an egg was âlostâ to the abdominal cavity during the transfer from ovary to uterine tube, or in which an embryo from a tubal pregnancy re-implanted in the abdomen). Once in the abdominal cavity, an embryo can implant into any well-vascularized structureâthe rectouterine cavity (Douglasâ pouch), the mesentery of the intestines, and the greater omentum are some common sites. Tubal pregnancies can be caused by scar tissue within the tube following a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. The scar tissue impedes the progress of the embryo into the uterusâin some cases âsnaggingâ the embryo and, in other cases, blocking the tube completely. Approximately one half of tubal pregnancies resolve spontaneously. Implantation in a uterine tube causes bleeding, which appears to stimulate smooth muscle contractions and expulsion of the embryo. In the remaining cases, medical or surgical intervention is necessary. If an ectopic pregnancy is detected early, the embryoâs development can be arrested by the administration of the cytotoxic drug methotrexate, which inhibits the metabolism of folic acid. If diagnosis is late and the uterine tube is already ruptured, surgical repair is essential. Even if the embryo has successfully found its way to the uterus, it does not always implant in an optimal location (the fundus or the posterior wall of the uterus). Placenta previa can result if an embryo implants close to the internal os of the uterus (the internal opening of the cervix). As the fetus grows, the placenta can partially or completely cover the opening of the cervix (Figure 28.7). Although it occurs in only 0.5 percent of pregnancies, placenta previa is the leading cause of antepartum hemorrhage...\\n\\n\\nQ: In the vast majority of ectopic pregnancies, the embryo does not complete its journey to what organ, and instead implants in the uterine tube?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"uterus","rationale":"The context states that in most ectopic pregnancies, the embryo does not complete its journey to the uterus and implants instead in the uterine tube.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribesÂ âÂ China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art.

He also worked with composer Ramin Djawadi on numerous projects, including Clash of the Titans, Medal of Honor, Flash Forward, Prison Break, and Breakout Kings. Jacobs' first solo score was for the film Bad Karma (2012), starring Ray Liotta and Dominic Purcell, and he later collaborated with Scottish singer-songwriter, KT Tunstall, on the indie film Carried (2015). In 2017, Jacobs created the soundtrack for the Syfy adaptation of 12 Monkeys, and then for the comedy Random Tropical Paradise.

People suffering from low back pain (LBP) frequently show movement control impairments of the lumbar spine in sagittal plane. This cross-sectional, observational study investigated if the intensity of LBP attenuates lumbar movement control. The hypothesis was that lumbar movement control becomes more limited with increased pain intensity.', 'The effect of LBP intensity, measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS), on lumbar movement control was tested using three movement control tests. The lumbar range of motion (ROM), the ratio of lumbar and hip ROM as indicators of direction specific movement control, and the recurrence and determinism of repetitive lumbar movement patterns were assessed in ninety-four persons suffering from LBP of different intensity and measured with an inertial measurement unit system. Generalized linear models were fitted for each outcome.', 'Lumbar ROM (+ 0.03Â°, p = 0.24) and ratio of lumbar and hip ROM (0.01, p = 0.84) were unaffected by LBP intensity. Each one point increase on the NRS resulted in a decrease of recurrence and determinism of lumbar movement patterns (-3.11 to -0.06, p â©½ 0.05).\\nAnswer: Our results indicate changes in movement control in people suffering from LBP.

International news is bad, but these Americans do not want to hear it. While they all dislike Communism and appreciate the material wealth they enjoy, they also want lower taxes and don't see the need for industrial support of government. As he swishes the brandy around his snifter, Ohman tells the others that many Americans want safety and security, but do not want to make any sacrifices for it.\\nSuddenly the news becomes worse. \\"The Enemy\\" is staging air attacks over Seal Point, Alaska and then Nome. Paratroops have landed on Alaskan airfields and an American female communications operator is gunned down in mid-sentence.

The United States fights back and attacks The Enemy's homeland with Convair B-36 missions, but The Enemy steadily moves into Washington and Oregon. Shipyards in Puget Sound are A-bombed with large casualties.\\nMeanwhile, the Americans at the bar scramble to return to their lives to do what they can against The Enemy, now that it is too late.

Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called \\"kef\\" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \\"kef\\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of \\"kef music\\" heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star Cher.

King George V was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code.

We do so using a hierarchical Keyframe-Inpainter (KeyIn) model that first generates keyframes and their temporal placement and then inpaints the sequences between keyframes. We propose a fully differentiable formulation for efficiently learning the keyframe placement. We show that KeyIn finds informative keyframes in several datasets with diverse dynamics. When evaluated on a planning task, KeyIn outperforms other recent proposals for learning hierarchical representations.","target":"We propose a model that learns to discover informative frames in a future video sequence and represent the video via its keyframes","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose a model that learns to discover informative frames in a future video sequence and represent the video via its keyframes."},{"source":"Ronaldo turned up for training later in the day.

In August 2013, news accounts quoted an official from Japanâs Nuclear Regulatory Authority as stating that highly radioactive water was seeping from the plant into the Pacific Ocean and creating an âemergencyâ situation that the plantâs operators were not adequately containing: Highly radioactive water seeping into the ocean from Japanâs crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is creating an âemergencyâ that the operator is struggling to contain, an official from the countryâs nuclear watchdog said on Monday. This contaminated groundwater has breached an underground barrier, is rising toward the surface and is exceeding legal limits of radioactive discharge, Shinji Kinjo, head of a Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) task force, [said]. Countermeasures planned by Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) are only a temporary solution, he said. Tepcoâs âsense of crisis is weak,â Kinjo said. âThis is why you canât just leave it up to Tepco aloneâ to grapple with the ongoing disaster. âRight now, we have an emergency,â he said. References to these news accounts were widely circulated on the Internet accompanied by a color graphic supposedly showing the flow of radioactive discharge from Fukushima all the way across the Pacific Ocean to the western coasts of North and South America and down to Antarctica:  However, that chart did not actually track or measure radioactive discharge emanating from Fukushima in 2013, or any other aspect of the Fukushima disaster. It was a plot created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) immediately after the Tohoku earthquake in March 2011 showing the wave height of the tsunami that followed. It had (and has) nothing to do with the flow or spread of radioactive seepage from Fukushima. As for whether the current Fukushima âemergencyâ poses a danger to residents of the U.S., American officials have stated that the diluting effects of the vast Pacific Ocean expanse would likely neutralize any deleterious effects from the radioactive seepage by the time it reached U.S. shores: In the United States, across the Pacific, there was no sense of alarm. âWith the amount of dilution that would occur, any kind of release in Japan would be non-detectable here,â said David Yogi, spokesman for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Eric Norman, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said the latest leak was not a concern. âThe Pacific Ocean is an enormous place,â said Norman, who found radiation from the Fukushima nuclear power in California rainwater, milk and plants soon after the earthquake and tsunami. âThereâs a lot of material between us and Japan. No matter what happens in Fukushima, itâs not going to be a problem over here.â Likewise, the Hawaii State Department of Health has been monitoring Japanese water quality surveys and anticipates no public health effect in that state due to leaks from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant: The Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) continues to monitor the results of water quality surveys [from Japan] and does not anticipate any public health effect on beachgoers or seafood safety around the Hawaiian Islands, due to the following factors: â¢ Water acts as a diluent. While there may be significant quantities of radioactive material released into the sea near the Fukushima reactor site, the massive amount of water in the Pacific Ocean would rapidly dilute and disperse the materials to negligible levels. â¢ Some radioactive isotopes rapidly decay. For example, the half life of Iodine-131 (I-131) is about eight days. This means that the activity level of the I-131 isotope drops by half every eight days. Given the length of time since the event, the short-lived radionuclides would have decayed to near background levels and therefore pose no health hazard. Although Cesium isotopes have longer half-lives (Cs-134 has a half-life of about two years, Cs-137 a longer half-life of about 30 years), the radionuclides also undergo biological excretion and do not continue to build up in fish forever. (Similar âfalse imageâ fears were spurred by the Internet circulation of a nuclear fallout map back in March 2011.) In December 2013, alarmist reports were spread on the Internet with headlines such as âTEPCO Quietly Admits Reactor 3 Could Be Melting Down Now!â and âPersons residing on the west coast of North America should IMMEDIATELY begin preparing for another possible onslaught of dangerous atmospheric radiation!â Such claims were exaggerations based on much less sensational reports (similar to ones issued several months earlier) which simply stated that the plantâs operators, the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), had recently observed steam issuing from one of the damaged Fukushima reactor buildings but had ânot identified [any] abnormal plant conditions.â As noted at the Fukushima Diary blog: Since the end of 2013, a hoax has been going around on the Internet saying that Reactor #3 is experiencing a meltdown. (In fact, it had already melted down some time earlier.) From my observation, this mess started with an article on Enenews saying that Reactor #3 had been observed still steaming multiple times in December, which is correct. However, âsteamâ has been observed issuing from that reactor beginning in July 2013, and since then it has been observed almost every day. From the frequency of the âsteam,â I assume it is evaporated coolant water leaking out of primary containment vessel, and weâre seeing it now because TEPCO has removed the major debris from the top of the reactor. Probably the steam has been coming up since just after [the earthquake of] March 2011. Sure itâs extremely radioactive, nobody can stand on the top of reactor #3, and itâs harmful for the west coast. However, itâs been that way for 3 years now.

We are in town for the holidays visiting her parents who have been very generous to let us stay in their vacation home an hour by car outside of town. Thereâs a train that goes into town but most days fiancÃ©âs parents will drive us back and forth into town. Some nights her parents will stay in the vacation home with us, other nights they have their regular home in town so theyâll just drop us off at the vacation home at night, hang out for a bit before heading back into town, then come back out in the morning to drive us into town. \\n\\nAll has been generally fine, my fiancÃ©âs parents are the absolute nicest people and we get along well. But being in my 30âs especially, I appreciate having a little independence. So rather than being driven around by my fiancÃ©âs parents back and forth from the vacation home, Iâve suggested to my fiancÃ© that we take the train to and from town which takes an extra hour maybe each way.\\n\\nThe other day as my fiancÃ© and I were on our way back from town on the train, her parents called her and insisted on picking us up from the next train station to drive us back to the vacation home. I told my fiancÃ© that I much rather just stay on the train and walk, I didnât like sitting in the back of a car in general, and to let them know weâre ok staying on the train. But despite my fiancÃ©âs efforts to tell them that weâre fine and already on a train, her parents persisted (almost getting angry at my fiancÃ© at one point) so my fiancÃ© gave up and told me we had to get off at the next station where her parents were waiting for us. I was annoyed and unsure how to approach the situation, so just sat silently on the car ride home. My fiancÃ© tried explaining to her parents that they were being controlling and her parents cheerfully apologized, but I could see that they found it strange to be apologizing for what they felt was them just being accommodating.\\n\\nThen the next day, my fiancÃ© had plans to hang out with her parents for the day so I went over to a cousinâs place in town to spend time with him and his family. Later that evening, my fiancÃ© messaged me to let me know that her and her parents would be coming by at 9 pm to pick me up from my cousinâs to take us back to the vacation home. I asked if they could just drop her off at my cousinâs as we were having a nice time catching up, and her and I could find our own way home later. \\n\\nThat turned out to not be an option, and again my fiancÃ©âs parents insisted on taking us back. I was again annoyed but conceded, and again expressed my annoyance by not saying a word on the ride home. Her parents tried to act as though nothing was wrong. When we got back to the vacation home they offered me food they had cooked but my annoyance at being treated like a child got the best of me and I just excused myself and went to bed early.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for wanting a little flexibility with my time and my fiancÃ©âs time when weâre on vacation?

The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.\\n\\n- A situation comedy, or sitcom, is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode. Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio, but today are found mostly on television as one9 of its dominant narrative forms. This form can also include mockumentaries.\\n\\n- The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical depiction of working-class life epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television, and the human condition.\\n\\n- Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.\\n\\n- Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television.

Kicker Mike Nugent added on to that lead with a 55-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter to give the Bengals a 24-0 lead going into intermission.

Throughout the 1740s, the Hanthawaddy forces were winning against Upper Burma-based Toungoo armies. The Siamese were concerned by another rising power in Burma since a strong Burma historically meant future invasions to Siam. Concerned, the Siamese court readily gave protection to the Burmese governors of Martaban and Tavoy who had fled to Siam. In 1745, they sent a diplomatic mission to Ava to evaluate the political situation there, and were received by the Burmese king Mahadhammaraza Dipadi. They saw an Ava court that was on its last legs. By 1751, Restored Hanthawaddy forces were closing in on Ava. The Siamese concerns about the emergence of another strong dynasty based in Pegu appeared imminent. Perhaps as a precautionary measure, the Siamese decided to move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751. While it remains unclear as to whether the Siamese ever intended to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma, the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm bells in Pegu. Deeply concerned, the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two-thirds of their army back down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752. This redeployment of Hanthawaddy troops proved a critical turning point in Burmese history as it gave nascent Upper Burmese resistance groups much needed breathing room. The Hanthawaddy command left less than 10,000 men to pacify all of Upper Burma. Taking advantage of light Hanthawaddy troops, one resistance group, the Konbaung Dynasty led by Alaungpaya, drove out Hanthawaddy troops from Upper Burma by May 1754.

Although they have the same small amount of people, the city of Kilmar is experiencing demographic stochasticity while the city of Plano is not. Every time an election arises, both cities become very active with citizens coming out in droves to listen to the candidates speak at town hall meetings through the months leading up to the election.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Demographic stochasticity refers to variability in population growth arising from sampling random births and deaths in a population of finite size. In small populations, demographic stochasticity will decrease the population growth rate, causing an effect similar to the Allee effect, which will increase the risk of population extinction. Whether or not demographic stochasticity can be considered a part of Allee effect is somewhat contentious however. The most current definition of Allee effect considers the correlation between population density and mean individual fitness. Therefore, random variation resulting from birth and death events would not be considered part of Allee effect as the increased risk of extinction is not a consequence of the changing fates of individuals within the population.Meanwhile, when demographic stochasticity results in fluctuations of sex ratios, it arguably reduces the mean individual fitness as population declines. For example, a fluctuation in small population that causes a scarcity in one sex would in turn limit the access of mates for the opposite sex, decreasing the fitness of the individuals within the population. This type of Allee effect will likely be more prevalent in monogamous species than polygynous species.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which city's population will grow faster?","target":"Plano","rationale":"[Expert's Commentary]  I think the answer should be Plano.

Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829).

Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.

Passage:After the All Blacks tour, amid a time where prominent California colleges and universities were transitioning back to playing American football from rugby union, no further matches were held. However, after organizing a team for a successful tour of British Columbia in early 1920, the California Rugby Union successfully petitioned the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to enter a team at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. The USOC declined to provide any funding for this team; in June 1920, the Amateur Athletic Union agreed to pay for the team's expenses. After each of the home nations declined to send a team to the Games on account of scheduling conflicts with their domestic competitions, and the teams from Romania and Czechoslovakia withdrew from the Games on short notice, the Olympic rugby union competition was reduced to a single match between the United States and France. After a scoreless first half, the United States won this match by a score of 8â0. Following the Olympics, the French Rugby Union invited the American team to tour France. Sixteen members of the team that competed in the Olympics traveled to France and played three uncapped matches against regional opposition from the southeast, south, and southwest of France; each resulted in a victory for the Americans. A final match against the French national team was held on October 10, 1920 in Paris, resulting in a 14â5 defeat for the Americans. Upon returning to the United States, the team was disbanded. Charles Tilden served as team captain during the 1920 Olympics and the tour of France that followed.

Passage 1:Following his completion of secondary school, DemiÃ©ville spent time studying in Munich, London, and Edinburgh, where he was able to attend lectures by George Saintsbury at the University of Edinburgh. He then attended the University of Paris, where he wrote an essay on the musical suite of the 17th and 18th centuries and was awarded a licentiate degree in 1914. DemiÃ©ville then spent the year 1915 studying at King's College London where he was introduced to Chinese, which quickly became his focus. After returning to France, DemiÃ©ville studied at the Ãcole des Langues Orientales Vivantes (School of Living Oriental Languages), after which he moved to the CollÃ¨ge de France, where he further studied Chinese under the tutelage of Ãdouard Chavannes and began learning Sanskrit from Sylvain LÃ©vi. He earned his DiplÃ´mÃ© from the Ãcole des Langues Orientales Vivantes in 1919.\\n Passage 2:In July 2011, Ball signed a new three-year contract, which extended his stay at the Pride Park club until at least 2014. Ball scored his first senior goal for the club in a 2â1 win at home to Bristol City on 10 December 2011. Ball then scored the opening goal of the game against West Ham which was a great curling effort form the edge of the area after being played in by Nathan Tyson, this was the second former England goal keeper (Robert Green) he had scored against after scoring his first goal against David James. Ball scored his 3rd goal for derby, which proved to be the winner against Coventry City, once again this proved to be a goal against an internationally capped goal keeper in Joe Murphy who at the time had been capped twice by the Republic of Ireland. Ball became a regular in the Rams matchday 16 until he picked up an ankle injury in a reserves game against Belper Town on 26 March 2012. Ball returned from injury a 3â2 reserve win against Sunderland Reserves in the Totesport Cup semi-final game on 19 April 2012, playing the whole 90 minutes in central defence.\\n Passage 3:At the time of his ordeal, Berk was the regional dean of the Texas Tech medical branch in Amarillo, but on August 1, 2006, he was moved to the high position at the Lubbock campus. There are two other branch campuses in Odessa and El Paso. At the time of his abduction, Berk was at home on Sunday morning with his younger son, Justin. The older son, Jeremy, was away in college. Berk's wife, Shirley H. Berk (born c. 1950), a microbiologist who had served on a school board while they lived in Johnson City, Tennessee, was at church. The culprit, Jack Lindsey Jordan (born in 1963 in Seminole, Texas), gained entry from an open rear garage door and an unlocked back entrance to the residence. Normally, both the garage and the back door would have been locked. Jordan demanded money and jewelry to pay for transportation and narcotics, particularly methamphetamines, as he proceeded along Interstate 40 west toward New Mexico. After being held for four hours in Jordan's vehicle on a cool, windy day, common to the Panhandle in March, Berk was released unharmed near a gasoline station in rural Bushland in southwestern Potter County. This life-threatening event propelled the physician to write about his ordeal. He interlaces the narrative with much of his life story, from his birth in New York City, his childhood in New Jersey, his medical education at Boston University School of Medicine, his work in the fields of infectious diseases,geriatrics, and internal medicine at the East Tennessee State University James H. Quillen College of Medicine in Johnson City, and his relocation to Amarillo, his adopted city which he had grown to love. Since the events of 2005, Dr. Berk has been transferred to the main medical campus in Lubbock.","target":"2","rationale":"The question asks for the league in which Ball was playing when he got injured.

The coordination of the plant immune response is known to require the activity of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, which controls the stability of proteins in eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that the N-end rule pathway, a subset of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, regulates the defense against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that this pathway positively regulates the biosynthesis of plant-defense metabolites such as glucosinolates, as well as the biosynthesis and response to the phytohormone jasmonic acid, which plays a key role in plant immunity. Our results also suggest that the arginylation branch of the N-end rule pathway regulates the timing and amplitude of the defense program against the model pathogen Pseudomonas syringae AvrRpm1..

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.

You normally canât see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click.

Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.\\n\\n- Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.\\n\\n- Human geography is the branch of the social sciences that deals with the study of people and their communities,\\ncultures, economies and interaction with the environment by noticing their relations with and across space and place. As an intellectual discipline, geography is divided into the sub-fields of physical geography and human geography, the latter concentrating upon the study of human activities, by the application of qualitative and quantitative research methods.\\n\\n- Claudius Ptolemy (\\"KlaÃºdios PtolemaÃ®os\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around ADÂ 168.\\n\\n- Modern warfare is warfare using the concepts, methods, and military technology that have come into use during and after World War II. The concepts and methods have assumed more complex forms of the 19th- and early-20th-century antecedents, largely due to the widespread use of highly advanced information technology, and combatants must modernize constantly to preserve their battle worthiness.\\nAlthough total war was thought to be the form of international conflicts from the experience of the French Revolutionary Wars to World War II, the term no longer describes warfare in which a belligerent use all of its resources to destroy the enemy's organized ability to engage in war. The practice of total war which had been in use for over a century, as a form of war policy, has been changed dramatically with greater awareness of tactical, operational, and strategic battle information.\\n\\n- Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\\n\\n- Postcolonialism or postcolonial studies is an academic discipline that analyzes, explains, and responds to the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism. Postcolonialism speaks about the human consequences of external control and economic exploitation of native people and their lands. Drawing from postmodern schools of thought, postcolonial studies analyse the politics of knowledge (creation, control, and distribution) by examining the functional relations of social and political power that sustain colonialism and neocolonialismthe imperial regime's depictions (social, political, cultural) of the colonizer and of the colonized.\\n\\n- Jane Margaret Jacobs ( born May 2 , 1958 ) is an Australian academic , currently serving as Professor of Social Sciences at Yale - NUS College and formerly as Professor of Cultural Geography , in the School of Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh .

Times Higher Education ranks Melbourne as 33rd in the world, while the Academic Ranking of World Universities places Melbourne 40th in the world (both first in Australia). \\n\\n- Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 local government council areas. Located in Lothian on the Firth of Forth's southern shore, it is Scotland's second most populous city and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The 2014 official population estimates are 464,990 for the city of Edinburgh, 492,680 for the local authority area, and 1,339,380 for the city region as of 2014 (Edinburgh lies at the heart of the proposed Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region). Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is home to the Scottish Parliament and the seat of the monarchy in Scotland. The city is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and home to national institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. It is the largest financial centre in the UK after London.\\n\\n- Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.\\n\\n- Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.\\n\\n- Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.\\n\\n- The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world.\\n\\n- In human social affairs, discrimination is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which the person or thing is perceived to belong rather than on individual merit. This includes treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, \\"in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated\\". It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on logical or irrational decision making.\\n\\n- Neocolonialism, neo-colonialism or neo-imperialism is the practice of using capitalism, globalization and cultural imperialism to influence a developing country in lieu of direct military control (imperialism) or indirect political control (hegemony). Neo-colonialism is discussed in the works of Jean-Paul Sartre (\\"Colonialism and Neo-colonialism\\", 1964) and Noam Chomsky (\\"The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism\\", 1979).\\n\\n- Cultural geography is a sub-field within human geography. Though the first traces of the study of different nations and cultures on Earth can be dated back to ancient geographers such as Ptolemy or Strabo, cultural geography as academic study firstly emerged as an alternative to the environmental determinist theories of the early Twentieth century, which had believed that people and societies are controlled by the environment in which they develop. Rather than studying pre-determined regions based upon environmental classifications, cultural geography became interested in cultural landscapes. This was led by Carl O. Sauer (called the father of cultural geography), at the University of California, Berkeley. As a result, cultural geography was long dominated by American writers.\\n\\n- Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.\\n\\n- The University of Edinburgh (abbreviated as Edin. in post-nominals), founded in 1582, is the sixth oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's ancient universities. The university is deeply embedded in the fabric of the city of Edinburgh, with many of the buildings in the historic Old Town belonging to the university.\\n\\n- Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\\n\\n- Modernity is a term of art used in the humanities and social sciences to designate both a historical period (the modern era), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices that arose in post-medieval Europe and have developed since, in various ways and at various times, around the world. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from fashion to modern warfare), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics .\\n\\n- A monument is a type of structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become important to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, or as an example of historic architecture. The term 'monument' is often applied to buildings or structures that are considered examples of important architectural and/or cultural heritage.\\n\\n- Prejudice is prejudgement or forming an opinion before becoming aware of the relevant facts of a case. The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavorable, judgments toward people or a person because of their gender, beliefs, values, social class, age, disability, religion, sexuality, race/ethnicity, language, nationality, beauty, occupation, education, criminality, sport team affiliation or other personal characteristics. In this case, it refers to a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on their perceived group membership.\\n\\n- Strabo (\\"Strabn\\"; 64 or 63 BC) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.\\n\\n- Carl Ortwin Sauer (December 24, 1889  July 18, 1975) was an American geographer. Sauer was a professor of geography at the University of California at Berkeley from 1923 until becoming professor emeritus in 1957. He has been called \\"the dean of American historical geography\\" and he was instrumental in the early development of the geography graduate school at Berkeley. One of his best known works was \\"Agricultural Origins and Dispersals\\" (1952). In 1927, Carl Sauer wrote the article \\"Recent Developments in Cultural Geography,\\" which considered how cultural landscapes are made up of \\"the forms superimposed on the physical landscape.\\"\\n\\n- Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.\\n\\n- Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"\\n\\n- Cultural heritage is the legacy of physical science artifacts and intangible attributes of a group or society that are inherited from past generations, maintained in the present and bestowed for the benefit of future generations. Cultural heritage includes tangible culture (such as buildings, monuments, landscapes, books, works of art, and artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language, and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant landscapes, and biodiversity).\\n\\n- A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. \\n\\n- Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term \\"costume\\" is regularly linked to the term \\"fashion\\", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while \\"fashion\\" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.\\n\\n- Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), also known as Shanghai Ranking, is an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy. The league table was originally compiled and issued by Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2003, the first global ranking with multifarious indicators, after which a board of international advisories was established to provide suggestions. The publication currently includes world's overall and subject league tables, alongside independent regional \\"Greater China Ranking\\" and \\"Macedonian HEIs Ranking\\". ARWU is regarded as one of the three most influential and widely observed university measures, alongside \\"QS World University Rankings\\" and \\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\\". \\nIt is praised for its objective methodology but draws some condemnation for narrowly focusing on raw research power, undermining humanities and quality of instruction.\\n\\n- Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.\\n\\n- Melbourne is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in Australia. The name \\"Melbourne\\" refers to an urban agglomeration spanning which comprises the broader metropolitan area, as well as being the common name for its city centre. The metropolis is located on the large natural bay of Port Phillip and expands into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon mountain ranges, Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley. Melbourne consists of 31 municipalities. It has a population of 4,529,500 , and its inhabitants are called Melburnians.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'jane m. jacobs'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- academic\\n - anthropologist\\n - architecture\\n - astronomer\\n - author\\n - band\\n - diversity\\n - drawing\\n - expert\\n - faculty\\n - fashion\\n - general\\n - geographer\\n - historian\\n - intellectual\\n - leader\\n - linguistics\\n - major\\n - mathematician\\n - member\\n - military\\n - mountain\\n - pedagogy\\n - profession\\n - professor\\n - religion\\n - research\\n - revolutionary\\n - science\\n - united kingdom\\n - university of edinburgh\\n - writer","target":"geographer","rationale":"The term geographer refers to the study of objects and entities in relation to geography.

These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.\\n\\n- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- An ascospore is a spore contained in an ascus or that was produced inside an ascus. This kind of spore is specific to fungi classified as ascomycetes (Ascomycota).\\n\\n- \\nIn formal nomenclature.\\nWhen formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, stipulates that \\"species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations\\", but ranks higher than the genus may be assigned \\"incertae sedis\\".\\n\\n- The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011.\\n\\n- A genus (Â genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- An ascus (plural asci; from Greek  \\"skÃ³s\\" 'skin bag') is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in ascomycete fungi. Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division. However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. \\"Monosporascus cannonballus\\"), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. \\"Tympanis\\") with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some \\"Cordyceps\\", also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus, refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the \\"bourrelet\\" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus).\\n\\n- Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Clypeolum is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum . The relationship of this taxon to other taxa within the class is unknown ( incertae sedis ) , and it has not yet been placed with certainty into any class , order , or family .\\n\\n- Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: (\\"askos\\"), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences.\\n\\n- Dikarya is a subkingdom of Fungi that includes the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, both of which in general produce dikaryons, may be filamentous or unicellular, but are always without flagella. The Dikarya are most of the so-called \\"higher fungi\\", but also include many anamorphic species that would have been classified as molds in historical literature. Phylogenetically the two phyla regularly group together. In a 1998 publication, Thomas Cavalier-Smith referred to this group as the Neomycota.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'clypeolum'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- animal\\n - ascomycetes\\n - ascomycota\\n - ascospore\\n - basidiomycota\\n - cordyceps\\n - dikarya\\n - fungi\\n - helix\\n - homo\\n - phyla\\n - planes\\n - plant\\n - vitis","target":"ascomycetes","rationale":"The given information about Clypeolum states that this taxon is unknown and has not yet been placed with certainty into any class, order, or family.

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.

Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures.\\nDentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth.\\nDentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth.\\nDentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little  _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings.\\nPeople usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums.

London dispersion forces hold the layers together. To learn more, see the discussion of these weak forces in the chapter on liquids and solids. The weak forces between layers give graphite the soft, flaky character that makes it useful as the so-called âleadâ in pencils and the slippery character that makes it useful as a lubricant. The loosely held electrons in the resonating Ï bonds can move throughout the solid and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite. Other forms of elemental carbon include carbon black, charcoal, and coke. Carbon black is an amorphous form of carbon prepared by the incomplete combustion of natural gas, CH4. It is possible to produce charcoal and coke by heating wood and coal, respectively, at high temperatures in the absence of air. Recently, new forms of elemental carbon molecules have been identified in the soot generated by a smoky flame and in the vapor produced when graphite is heated to very high temperatures in a vacuum or in helium. One of these new forms, first isolated by Professor Richard Smalley and coworkers at Rice University, consists of icosahedral (soccerball-shaped) molecules that contain 60 carbon atoms, C60.

We hypothesized that tachycardia mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation acted to defend VO2max at high altitude. Propranolol treatment beginning before high-altitude (4,300 m) ascent reduced heart rate during maximal and submaximal exercise in six healthy men treated with propranolol (80 mg three times daily) compared with five healthy subjects receiving placebo (lactose). Compared with sea-level values, the VO2max fell on day 2 at high altitude, but the magnitude of fall was similar in the placebo and propranolol treatment groups (26 +/- 6 vs. 32 +/- 5%, P = NS) and VO2max remained similar at high altitude in both groups once treatment was discontinued. During 30 min of submaximal (80% of VO2max) exercise, propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake levels that were as large as those in placebo subjects. The maintenance of maximal or submaximal levels of O2 uptake in propranolol-treated subjects at 4,300 m could not be attributed to increased minute ventilation, arterial O2 saturation, or hemoglobin concentration. Rather, it appeared that propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake by transporting a greater proportion of the O2 uptake with each heartbeat. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, beta-adrenergic blockade did not impair maximal or submaximal O2 uptake at high altitude due perhaps to compensatory mechanisms acting to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Propranolol does not impair exercise oxygen uptake in normal men at high altitude. option2: The absorption of dietary phosphorus and calcium in hemodialysis patients.","target":"Propranolol does not impair exercise oxygen uptake in normal men at high altitude","rationale":"The title \\"Propranolol does not impair exercise oxygen uptake in normal men at high altitude\\" best summarizes the main idea of the abstract.

IDH was defined as a SBP reduction of >20 mm Hg end-HD vs. pre-HD.', 'Fourteen patients demonstrated IDH. The mean SBP reduction during HD in this group was -35 +/- 13 mm Hg compared to an increase of +2 +/- 12 mm Hg among the 38 patients without IDH (no-IDH).

Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820 km / h (510 mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as 'Fourth of July fireworks'. On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus's atmospheric activity. Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather. Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere have existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes. A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s. Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.

The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. PÃ¤cht describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type â perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) â and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434â36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...","target":"Mary","rationale":"The question asks for the first name of a subject in the passage.

Bone anywhere in your body will usually take a few weeks to heal, and the same is true of your jawbone.

Dental Implant Techniques Once the skin stretching is completed, you'll most likely have more surgery to replace the tissue expander with a permanent implant. Surgery is usually scheduled about 4 to 6 weeks after the last amount of liquid has been added to the expander. Surgery to insert the permanent implant takes about an hour.

Now, you may say, \\"But elaboratenoodle! Horses are so expensive â you are very privileged!\\" However, I can assure you that we are far from wealthy â the horses are our only \\"splurge,\\" and I don't enjoy or ever ride them. Because of the horses, my mother has disrupted our lives in a bunch of little ways, but the biggest issue was when she moved our whole family to a different county in order to buy a farm, which meant leaving all of my friends behind and moving to an area where the closest grocery store is almost half an hour away, and going to my office (which I only do once a week) takes almost an hour. But, the little things are just as bad â things like selling our beloved pop-up camper to buy a horse trailer. Now, as every pre-teen has inevitably been told, *owning horses is expensive*. And, yeah, it can be. However, the prices goes up significantly when the two perfectionists that are my parents decide to purchase *a farm*, a brand new truck, a tractor, and a horse trailer.\\n\\nMy parents are pretty smart, but all of these things are pretty financially taxing, and I know we're in a lot of debt. Now, don't get me wrong: I still have an amazing life, and my parents really do care about and love me and my siblings. They even helped me to buy my first car, and pay for my insurance. Still, I still am not happy about this horse scenario. Because we are in debt, I feel *really* guilty whenever they spend money on me at all â I've started paying for my own tuition, a lot of my own food, and I will occasionally secretly cover their grocery bills when I go shopping. But, it's taken a toll on our lives: we avoid making necessary repairs to our house and our cars, paying the taxes is always an ordeal, and we can't afford to go on any trips.\\n\\nNow, I understand that it's their money, and I appreciate everything that they do for me. But now, I'm preparing to go to college, and their income is high enough to prevent me from getting good financial aid, but because they spend it so foolishly, they can't afford to even help me a little, like paying for my books or helping me out with the cost of housing. And I know that I don't deserve any of their money, but I am still not thrilled about the prospect of owing \\\\~$100,000 for college (and no, I am not going to community college; the closest \\"community\\" college is farther away than several four-year universities).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Situation:**\\n\\nSo, as you can tell, I am not super thrilled about the horses, and they've been a lot of trouble from my perspective. But, they are really something she enjoys, and a way for her to connect with my sister. Okay, great. But, one challenge is that my sister chose to attend a brick and mortar school, meaning that only myself and my mother are home during the day. Because of this, my mom often tries to guilt me into helping her with the \\"daily chores,\\" which include obsessively cleaning up after her horses, as well as brushing them, feeding them, and occasionally riding them.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I am very busy at all times: I have an intense course load (trust me, it's not the type of online school you're thinking of), in addition to a bunch of extracurriculars, as well as my responsibilities as my company's only web developer / IT specialist / technical support representative. I have a crazy life, but I am very lonely and depressed, which isn't great when combined with a huge workload. I am awake and working from about 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM, I have no local friends outside of work (and all of those people are a lot older than me), and the only time I get out of the house is when I go to the office or go skiing with my dad (we got really cheap season passes for which I had to pay most of the price). My mom, however doesn't really have time for this either, as she also works, in addition to having to take care of the house during the day, but I really don't think it's fair for me to expect me to add even more chaos to my life for these stupid animals â chaos that leaves me covered in filth for the rest of my day. I feel guilty for leaving her so much work, but I really do not need more stress in my life right now.

In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who â The Ultimate Adventure. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.

We go to school because we want to know more about the world around us. The typical classroom used to be the place where teachers and students were working and exploring the wonderful world of knowledge together, but now everything has changed. The Internet is one of those approaches. Learning via the Internet is a new style that seems to become successful than the traditional teaching. The Internet provides schools with a large amount of learning material that is accessible to students online. Owing to the choices of courses online, completing a program becomes much easier. We used to go to the library when we needed information and spend hours searching for the right sources. Today there is a \\"library\\" in our house and it is available 24 hours a day. From my personal experience, being a first time mother, I find that using information online is very helpful. While I am at home with my baby, I can still search for the material I need and exchange thoughts and information with my classmates without leaving my house. The Internet is not only a big information provider but also a money and time saver. People predict that education will be much cheaper in the future because of Internet access to information. The cost of land, building and wages for teachers are continuously increasing. In addition, regular courses (offline) depend heavily on books and other paper-based materials, while online education posts lectures, and assignments electronically, which saves thousands of dollars every year. With no physical restrictions, the Internet classes and courses are also very convenient. In classroom-based education there is a limitation on the number of students while Internet education is available to everyone. Students don't have to struggle in order to register for classes they like. Students will have more choices to take their courses and classes online. The Internet offers a wonderful opportunity to obtain knowledge in a more convenient and less expensive way. In my opinion, online life in the future is simply inescapable. \\n Question: What is the best title of the passage?","target":"online education","rationale":"The given context passage talks about the importance of online education.

We formally define the notion of incremental learning dynamics and derive the conditions on depth and initialization for which this phenomenon arises in deep linear models. Our main theoretical contribution is a dynamical depth separation result, proving that while shallow models can exhibit incremental learning dynamics, they require the initialization to be exponentially small for these dynamics to present themselves. However, once the model becomes deeper, the dependence becomes polynomial and incremental learning can arise in more natural settings. We complement our theoretical findings by experimenting with deep matrix sensing, quadratic neural networks and with binary classification using diagonal and convolutional linear networks, showing all of these models exhibit incremental learning.","target":"We study the sparsity-inducing bias of deep models, caused by their learning dynamics","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe study the sparsity-inducing bias of deep models, caused by their learning dynamics."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a context, a sentence,  and a character.

His father began working at a young age at the American branch of the Oxford University Press, which published bibles and standard classical works, eventually advancing to the position of vice president. His parents first met at the North Presbyterian Church, located at 31st Street and Ninth Avenue.\\n\\nThe United States entered into World War I in April 1917, and later that year Armstrong was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, and assigned to a laboratory in Paris, France to help develop radio communication for the Allied war effort. He returned to the United States in the fall of 1919, after being promoted to the rank of Major. (During both world wars, Armstrong gave the U.S. military free use of his patents.)  During this period Armstrong's most significant accomplishment was the development of a \\"supersonic heterodyne\\" -- soon shortened to \\"superheterodyne\\" -- radio receiver circuit. This circuit made radio receivers more sensitive and selective and is still extensively used today. The key feature of the superheterodyne approach is the mixing of the incoming radio signal with a locally generated, different frequency signal within a radio set. This circuit is typically referred to as the mixer. The end result is a fixed, unchanging intermediate frequency, or I.F. signal which is more easily amplified and detected by subsequent circuit stages that follow the mixer. In 1919, Armstrong filed an application for a U.S. patent of the superheterodyne circuit which was issued the next year. This patent was subsequently sold to Westinghouse. The patent would be challenged, however, triggering yet another patent office interference hearing. Armstrong ultimately lost this patent battle; although the outcome was less controversial than that involving the regeneration proceedings.  The challenger was Lucien Levy of France who had also worked developing Allied radio communication during World War I. He had been awarded French patents in 1917 and 1918 that covered some of the same basic ideas used in Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver. AT&T, which was interested in radio development at this time, primarily for point-to-point extensions of its wired telephone exchanges, purchased the U.S. rights to Levy's patent and contested Armstrong's grant. The subsequent court reviews continued until 1928, when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals disallowed all nine claims of Armstrong's patent, assigning priority for seven of the claims to Levy, and one each to Ernst Alexanderson of General Electric and Burton W. Kendall of Bell Laboratories.  Although most early radio receivers used regeneration Armstrong approached RCA's David Sarnoff, whom he had known since giving a demonstration of his regeneration receiver in 1913, about the corporation offering superheterodynes as a superior offering to the general public. (The ongoing patent dispute was not a hindrance, because extensive cross-licensing agreements signed in 1920 and 1921 between RCA, Westinghouse and AT&T meant that Armstrong could freely use the Levy patent.) Superheterodyne sets were initially thought to be prohibitively complicated and expensive as the initial designs required multiple tuning knobs and used nine vacuum-tubes. However, in conjunction with RCA engineers, Armstrong developed a simpler, less costly design. RCA introduced its superheterodyne Radiola sets in the U.S. market in early 1924, and they were an immediate success, dramatically increasing the corporation's profits. These sets were considered so valuable that RCA would not license the superheterodyne to other U.S. manufacturing companies until 1930.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What time period did this take place?","target":"He returned to the United States in the fall of 1919,","rationale":"The time period can be inferred from the following line:  \\"He returned to the United States in the fall of 1919, after being promoted to the rank of Major.\\""},{"source":"You are given two sentences.

We started to learn language when we were born. However, people are used to speaking their native language, so immigrants are having many problems between the first generation and the second generation because they don't have the same native language. Also, the second generation is losing their identity. Especially in America, there are many immigrants that came from different countries to succeed in the States.  Because they suffer in lots of areas such as getting a job and trying to speak English, they want their children to speak English, not only at school, but also at home in order to be more successful. Because of this situation, their children are losing their identity and, even more, they are ignoring their parents whose English is not very good.\\nI think most immigrants are trying to preserve their native language in their new country, but this doesn't help very much in getting a good job. My aunt taught Korean to her children not to help hem succeed in the U.S. she did so, hopefully, to help them establish a Korean identity. Though the second generation was born in the new country, they often get confused about their identity because they look different from others, and also, if they visit their parents' country, they will probably feel different from other people there too. My cousins told me that when they visited Korea a few years ago, they felt different from other Koreans. They could even feel it just strolling around the street because they wore different clothes and walked differently.\\nWe must realize that language is important and valuable for many reasons. Immigrants should make an effort not to be ignored by their children understand their background by teaching them the parents' language.

Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on peopleâs evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.","target":"Iceland","rationale":"The given context mentions that Iceland has higher taxes, and Greenland is a wealthy country.

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form.\\n\\nHow does it work? The Senate generally operates by unanimous consent. If any senators refuse to consent to holding an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuchâs nomination, the Senate has to decide whether to overrule them. It would do so by holding a âclotureâ vote on whether to end debate and proceed to a final vote. WASHINGTON â The Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch is now going to the Senate floor. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, has pledged to lead Democrats in a filibuster of the nomination. If he does, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has vowed to change Senate rules to clear the way for Judge Gorsuch. The potential showdown has raised interest in the peculiar Senate filibuster rule. But because a cloture process is often required to end debate on a bill, then the bill first must garner the support of a three-fifths supermajority. All told, this process of reaching a final vote on a bill can require about a week of Senate floor time to complete. Senate Rule XXII, often called the cloture rule, does allow a supermajority to limit debate on a bill, amendment, or motion; in addition, in the case of a bill, cloture limits the amendments that can be offered. Supporters of, for instance, a bill under floor consideration can file a cloture motion, signed by at least 16 Senators. What is cloture? Cloture â a process for limiting debate on a measure â is the Senateâs only weapon against the filibuster. The details have changed several times since its creation a century ago, but hereâs the rule as it stands today: cloture is invoked when three-fifths of all sworn-in senators vote for the cloture motion. The Senate nearly always has 100 members, putting the magic number at 60. In other words, the cloture vote is the stand-off between a filibustering minority and an annoyed majority. If at least 60 senators vote Yea, the filibuster ends. If fewer than 60 vote Yea, the filibuster continues. In both cases, the side that âlosesâ has no further weapons to fight with. Left-leaning political blogger Matthew Yglesias has argued for eliminating the filibuster in two articles: â 1 Failure Buster,â The American Prospect, April 2005. â 2 The Silenced Majority,â The Atlantic, December 2008. How many members of the Senate does it take to end cloture? Cloture is a limited debate, and must be voted in motion by at least 60 members (3/5ths) of the Senate, after a petition calling for the action is submitted by at least 16 members. What are the qualifications to be in the House of Representatives? Hold up action on a bill by refusing to yield the floor, gives individual senators a degree of influence over legislation that is not available to the members of the House, whose debate is governed by a more restrictive set of rules. 60 votes in the Senate are required to invoke cloture and end a filibuster. Serve as a link between the majority party's leadership and its rank and party members. They check with party members and tell the floor leader which members, and how many votes , can be counted on in any particular matter. They also see that all members of the party are present for important votes and that they vote with the party leadership. They report to the floor leaders. But rather than relying on the formal rules like cloture, frequently the Senate can more effectively act using unanimous consent agreements. Such an agreement is a structured plan for limiting debate and amending â a plan that can be tailored to each bill that comes to the floor (somewhat akin to a special rule in the House).

Eisele and R. Walter Cunningham to make the second manned flight test of the Apollo Command/Service Module, with a mission profile identical to Apollo 1. Schirra argued against a repeat mission, and his crew became the backup crew for Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. Schirra's crew conducted tests in the command module on January 26, 1967, and were enroute to Houston the next day when Grissom, White, and Young were killed in a fire during a test. Schirra's crew became the prime crew of the first manned flight. This became Apollo 7 in the program's revised mission numbering plan, and was delayed to the fall of 1968 while safety improvements were made to the Command Module.  Schirra gained a sense of security from having Guenter Wendt, a McDonnell Aircraft employee, as the pad leader responsible for the spacecraft's launch readiness. But since the Apollo contractor was North American Aviation, Wendt was no longer pad leader. After the Apollo 1 accident, Schirra felt so strongly he wanted none other than Wendt as pad leader for his Apollo flight, that he pulled strings with his boss Deke Slayton and North American's launch operations manager Bastian \\"Buzz\\" Hello to hire Wendt as Apollo 7 pad leader. Wendt remained pad leader for the remainder of the Apollo and Skylab programs, and stayed on with NASA into the Space Shuttle program before retiring.  Apollo 7 was launched on October 11, 1968, making Schirra the first person to fly in space three times. Prior to launch, Schirra had objected because of high winds, which could have injured the astronauts in the event of an abort within the first minute of the mission. After reaching orbit, the Apollo 7 CSM performed space rendezvous and docking exercises with the S-4B stage to simulate retrieving the Lunar Module.

The archaeologist Max Mallowan asserted that he \\"was a delightful, light-hearted and amusing companion, but those close to him knew that he could be a dangerous opponent if threatened with frustration\\".\\nHis charm offensives were often condemned as being insincere. During excavations, he was known as an authoritarian leader but favoured those who he thought exhibited bravery by standing up to his authority. Hence, he has been termed \\"a benevolent dictator\\". He was meticulous in his writings, and would repeatedly revise and rewrite both pieces for publication and personal letters. Throughout his life, he was a heavy smoker.Wheeler expressed the view that he was \\"the least political of mortals\\". Despite not taking a strong interest in politics, Wheeler was described by his biographer as \\"a natural conservative\\"; for instance, during his youth he was strongly critical of the Suffragettes and their cause of greater legal rights for women. Nevertheless, he was \\"usually happy to advance young women professionally\\", something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them. He expressed little interest in his relatives; in later life, he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties.Wheeler was married three times. In May 1914, Wheeler married Tessa Verney. Tessa became an accomplished archaeologist, and they collaborated until she died in 1936. Their only child, Michael Mortimer Wheeler, was born in January 1915; he became a barrister. Following Tessa's death, in 1939, Wheeler married Mavis de Vere Cole, widow of the prankster Horace de Vere Cole.

This increase in enzymatic activity was accompanied by an increase in calmodulin content of the basolateral membrane. Although neither exogenously added calmodulin (up to 10 micrograms/ml) nor calcium (from 10(-7)-10(-5) M) stimulated enzyme activity, calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W7, and W13 inhibited it. When calmodulin content, adenylate cyclase activity, and alkaline phosphatase activity were measured in cells sequentially eluted from the tip to the base of the villus, cells from the midregion and base had the highest calmodulin content and adenylate cyclase activity, whereas alkaline phosphatase activity (a brush border membrane enzyme) was highest in cells eluted from the tip. Adenylate cyclase activity was increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3, particularly in cells from the midvillus. Our results indicate that the response of adenylate cyclase activity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 varies along the villus and suggest that calmodulin may be involved.","target":"Adenyl Cyclase","rationale":"The abstract describes how administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increases adenylate cyclase activity in the duodenal epithelial cells.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them â just as no-till â categorized as conservation tillage.

Pamela was educated by governesses in the ancestral home at Minterne Magna in Dorset, along with her three younger siblings. Her great-great aunt was the nineteenth-century adventurer and courtesan Jane Digby (1807-1881), notorious for her exotic travels and scandalous personal life. Pamela was to follow in her ancestor's footsteps, being frequently cited as \\"the 20th-century's greatest courtesan.\\"\\n\\nBeside two additional marriages, Pamela Harriman had numerous affairs with men of prominence and wealth. During her marriage to Randolph Churchill, she had romantic involvements with men such as: W. Averell Harriman, who much later became her third husband; Edward R. Murrow; and John Hay \\"Jock\\" Whitney. Notable consorts after her divorce included Prince Aly Khan, Alfonso de Portago, Gianni Agnelli, and Baron Elie de Rothschild.  Churchill became well known for her attention to detail with men. When involved romantically with a man, she paid extremely close attention to his desires, his preferences, and went to any lengths necessary to satisfy his needs during the affair. William S. Paley, briefly a consort during the war, said: \\"She is the greatest courtesan of the century\\", meaning it more as a compliment than a detraction. The more critical Max Hastings said, acerbically, \\"she was ... described as having become 'a world expert on rich men's bedroom ceilings'.\\"  After her divorce from Randolph Churchill, she moved to Paris and in 1948 began her five-year-long affair with Gianni Agnelli. She described this as the happiest period of her life. Agnelli, however, was not faithful in this relationship. In 1952, Pamela found him with a young woman, Anne-Marie d'Estainville, and complained strongly about this, despite her own past behaviour. Agnelli sustained a severe leg injury in a car accident while bringing d'Estainville home. Pamela nursed him through his injury, and later became pregnant (although it was never confirmed that this was by Agnelli), but had an abortion in Switzerland. Later, Princess Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto became pregnant by Agnelli, and Pamela Churchill ended the affair.  Her next significant relationship was with Baron Elie de Rothschild, who was married. He supported her financially, and she was schooled in art history and wine-making during this clandestine and short relationship.

It is based on Tevye and his Daughters (or Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. The story centers on Tevye, the father of five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon the family's lives. He must cope both with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters, who wish to marry for love - each one's choice of a husband moves further away from the customs of his faith - and with the edict of the Tsar that evicts the Jews from their village.\\n\\nMonths later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kiev to work for the revolution. He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (\\"Now I Have Everything\\"). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After more soul searching, Tevye relents - the world is changing, and he must change with it (\\"Tevye's Rebuttal\\"). He informs the young couple that he gives them his blessing and his permission.  Tevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. \\"Love,\\" he says, \\"it's the new style.\\" Tevye asks Golde, despite their own arranged marriage, \\"Do You Love Me?\\" After dismissing Tevye's question as foolish, she eventually admits that, after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Meanwhile, Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka. News spreads quickly in Anatevka that Perchik has been arrested and exiled to Siberia (\\"The Rumor/I Just Heard\\"), and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved, wherever he may be, although she will always love her family (\\"Far From the Home I Love\\").  Time passes. Motel has purchased a used sewing machine, and he and Tzeitel have had a baby. Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish faith is a line he will not cross. He forbids Chava to speak to Fyedka again. When Golde brings news that Chava has eloped with Fyedka, Tevye wonders where he went wrong (\\"Chavaleh Sequence\\"). Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians expelling Jews from their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about \\"Anatevka\\" and how hard it will be to leave what has been their home for so long.  As the Jews leave Anatevka, Chava and Fyedka stop to tell her family that they are also leaving for Krakow, unwilling to remain among the people who could do such things to others. Tevye still will not talk to her, but when Tzeitel says goodbye to Chava, Tevye prompts her to add \\"God be with you.\\" Motel and Tzeitel go to Poland as well but will join the rest of the family when they have saved up enough money. As Tevye, Golde and their two youngest daughters leave the village for America, the fiddler begins to play.

As with the previously discussed nerve tracts, the sensory pathways of the trigeminal pathway each involve three successive neurons. First, axons from the trigeminal ganglion enter the brain stem at the level of the pons. These axons project to one of three locations. The spinal trigeminal nucleus of the medulla receives information similar to that carried by spinothalamic tract, such as pain and temperature sensations. Other axons go to either the chief sensory nucleus in the pons or the mesencephalic nuclei in the midbrain. These nuclei receive information like that carried by the dorsal column system, such as touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception. Axons from the second neuron decussate and ascend to the thalamus along the trigeminothalamic tract. In the thalamus, each axon synapses with the third neuron in its respective pathway. Axons from the third neuron then project from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex of the cerebrum. The sensory pathway for gustation travels along the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, which synapse with neurons of the solitary nucleus in the brain stem. Axons from the solitary nucleus then project to the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus. Finally, axons from the ventral posterior nucleus project to the gustatory cortex of the cerebral cortex, where taste is processed and consciously perceived. The sensory pathway for audition travels along the vestibulocochlear nerve, which synapses with neurons in the cochlear nuclei of the superior medulla. Within the brain stem, input from either ear is combined to extract location information from the auditory stimuli. Whereas the initial auditory stimuli received at the cochlea strictly represent the frequencyâor pitchâof the stimuli, the locations of sounds can be determined by comparing information arriving at both ears.\\n\\n\\nQ: Which pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- posterior pathway\\n\\n- dual pathway\\n\\n- cranial pathway\\n\\n- trigeminal pathway\\n\\nA:","target":"trigeminal pathway","rationale":"The paragraph states that the trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth and nasal cavity.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.\\n\\n- A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).\\n\\n- Philippe de Vitry (31 October 1291  9 June 1361) was a French composer, music theorist and poet. He was an accomplished, innovative, and influential composer, and may also have been the author of the \\"Ars Nova\\" treatise. He was widely acknowledged as the greatest musician of his day, with Petrarch writing a glowing tribute, calling him: \\"... the keenest and most ardent seeker of truth, so great a philosopher of our age.\\"\\n\\n- Guillaume de Machaut (sometimes spelled Machault; c. 1300  April 1377) was a medieval French poet and composer. He is one of the earliest composers on whom significant biographical information is available. According to Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, Machaut was \\"the last great poet who was also a composer\\". Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer.\\n\\n- A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.\\n\\n- Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"mÃ¡thma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- Ars nova (Latin for new art) refers to a musical style which flourished in France and the Burgundian Low Countries in the Late Middle Ages: more particularly, in the period between the preparation of the \\"Roman de Fauvel\\" (1310s) and the death of the composer Guillaume de Machaut in 1377. The term is sometimes used more generally to refer to all European polyphonic music of the 14th century. For instance, \\"Italian ars nova\\" is sometimes used to denote the music of Francesco Landini and his compatriots (although Trecento music is the more common term for music in Italy). The \\"ars\\" in \\"ars nova\\" can be read as \\"technique\\", or \\"style\\". The term was first used in two musical treatises, titled \\"Ars novae musicae\\" (New Technique of Music) (c. 1320) by Johannes de Muris, and a collection of writings (c. 1322) attributed to Philippe de Vitry often simply called \\"Ars nova\\" today.

Born in Normandy , he is believed to have been related to Julian des Murs who was secretary to Charles V of France . The suggested birth year for Muris is based on a murder of a cleric on September 7 , 1310 , which Muris was allegedly a part of . Muris would have been at least 14 to assume the responsibility for the crime , suggesting his birth year to be sometime in the 1290s . He was convicted and banished to Cyprus for seven years for punishment . The aloof and haphazard movements of his life have been blamed on this early punishment . By 1318 records indicate that Muris was living in Evreux although he was actively taking part in scholastic endeavors in Paris . An explicit of his writings indicate that he was a resident in the CollÃ¨ge de Sorbonne until around 1325 . During this time it is believed that he travelled freely , making trips to the town of Bernay to observe the solar eclipse of 1321 . However , the double monastery of Fontevrault ( Maine0et - Loire ) was where he settled in March 1326 . He remained associated with the institution until 1332 or 1333 when he returned to Evreux . Financial records in Muris '' own hand from 1336 indicate that he took up residence in Paris in that year . In 1342 he was one of six cannons of the collegiate church in MÃ©ziÃ¨res - en - Brenne .

A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.\\n\\n- The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.\\n\\n- Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".\\n\\n- Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.\\n\\n- Well of Shiuan is a 1978 science fiction novel written by C. J. Cherryh . It is the second of four books composing the Morgaine Stories , chronicling the deeds of Morgaine , a woman obsessed with a mission of the utmost importance , and her warrior companion , Nhi Vanye i Chya .\\n\\n- Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\\n\\n- DAW Books is an American science fiction and fantasy publisher, founded by Donald A. Wollheim following his departure from Ace Books in 1971. The company therefore claims to be \\"the first publishing company ever devoted exclusively to science fiction and fantasy.\\" The first DAW Book published was the 1972 short story collection \\"Spell of the Witch World\\" by Andre Norton.\\n\\n- Downbelow Station is a science fiction novel written by C. J. Cherryh and published in 1981 by DAW Books. It won the Hugo Award in 1982, was shortlisted for a Locus Award that same year, and was named by \\"Locus\\" magazine as one of the top 50 science fiction novels of all time in 1987.\\n\\n- The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Carolyn Janice Cherry (born September 1, 1942), better known by the pen name C. J. Cherryh, is an American writer of speculative fiction. She has written more than 60 books since the mid-1970s, including the Hugo Award-winning novels \\"Downbelow Station\\" (1981) and \\"Cyteen\\" (1988), both set in her Alliance-Union universe.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'publisher' with the subject 'well of shiuan'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- ace books\\n - creatures\\n - daw books\\n - faster than light\\n - naturalis\\n - plume\\n - portal\\n - unknown","target":"daw books","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"daw books\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you are given two sets, and you need to count the number of elements at the intersection of two given sets.

The centre of the region, a community focused on the old fort, would eventually become the city of Kingston. General Sir Frederick Haldimand, Governor of the Province of Quebec, ordered Major John Ross, commander at Oswego, to repair and rebuild the fort to accommodate a military garrison. This was done by a force of 422 men and 25 officers. By October 1783, a lime kiln, hospital, barracks, officers' quarters, storehouses, and a bakehouse were completed. In 1787, the rebuilt fort became known as TÃªte-de-Pont Barracks.  During the War of 1812, the fort was the focus of military activity in Kingston, having housed many military troops.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom.

Cruella therefore mends her working relationship with her valet Alonzo and has him lock away all her fur coats.

Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy's subjects are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their original states but conceals this discovery. Inevitably, when Big Ben rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality and enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal 102 Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood, specifically modifying the original design to use Dipstick's children.","target":"Chloe","rationale":"The context mentions that Cruella is released from prison into the custody of a probation officer.

Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the coyote then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.\\nBy the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995â96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list., can you guess it ?","target":"Yellowstone","rationale":"Yellowstone is the name of the park where wolves were reintroduced. Here's why: \\nThe article mentions that Yellowstone was once used to destroy wolves and other animals injurious to agriculture, but in recent times has been a place for recovering endangered species like wolf populations. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service decided to reintroduce northwestern Canadian wolves into this region as part of their recovery program, which says that this area would be important for restoring wolf populations after they had previously nearly become extinct from human activity (hunting). So based on these factors, it can be inferred that Yellowstone is one of the parks involved with efforts to recover Wolf population numbers through re-introduction programs by the United States governmentâs Fish and Wild Life agency"},{"source":"Aerobic exercise increases the size and strength of muscles in the heart and helps all your muscles develop greater endurance.\\n\\nHaving read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are larger or smaller ):\\n\\n\\nSomeone that works out in the gym all the time will likely have larger or smaller muscles than someone who sits at home all day?","target":"larger","rationale":"\\"Aerobic exercise increases the size and strength of muscles\\".

Both countries were significant lumber exporters.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich country had forest soils that displayed higher rates of chemical weathering?\\n\\nHint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.","target":"Burma","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that there are two countries: Burma, a tropical climate country and Belarus, a temperate climate country. Both of them have significant forest exports. When weathering occurs in soil, strong acids from the rain break down minerals into smaller molecules which then leach out with water or accumulate lower in the hillslope (podzolization). Tropical forests receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth because they are closer to equator so chemical weathering will likely be faster due to higher rates of decomposition as well as precipitation. Therefore it is most probable for Burma's soils display higher rates of chemical weathering since it has been mentioned before that its climates were tropical while Belarus had beautiful ancient temperate forests which would mean less amount of temperature increase"},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: Who were the founders of the Bantu land?\\nContext: Bantu-speaking peoples who founded tribes during the Bantu expansions largely displaced and absorbed the earliest inhabitants of the region, the Pygmy people, about 1500 BC.

He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan.

Passage:In 1944, Argentia served as one of the two stopover bases for the refuelling, maintenance, and crew changes of the six United States Navy (USN) K-class blimps that made the first transatlantic crossings of non-rigid airships. Blimps K-123 and K-130 from USN Blimp Squadron 14 (also known as ZP-14, Blimpron 14, or \\"The Africa Squadron\\") left South Weymouth Naval Air Station in Massachusetts on 28 May 1944 and landed at Argentia about 16 hours later. The two K-ships then flew for approximately 22 hours to Lages Field on Terceira Island in the Azores, the second stopover base for the transatlantic flights. The last leg was a ~20-hour flight to the squadron's final destination with Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 15 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco (now Kenitra, Morocco). Blimps K-123 and K-130 were followed by K-109 and K-134 then K-112 and K-101 which left South Weymouth on 11 and 27 June, respectively, in 1944. These six blimps initially conducted nighttime anti-submarine warfare operations to complement the daytime missions flown by FAW-15 aircraft (PBYs and PB4Y-2) using magnetic anomaly detection to locate U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar. Later, ZP-14 K-ships conducted minespotting and minesweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escort missions including that of the convoy carrying Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in early 1945. In late April 1945, K-89 and K-114 left NAS Weeksville (now Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City) in North Carolina and flew a southern route to NAS Bermuda, the Azores, and Port Lyautey, where they arrived on 1 May 1945.","target":"The last leg was a ~20-hour flight to the squadron's final destination with Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 15 at Port Lyautey, French Morocco (now Kenitra, Morocco)","rationale":"The question asks for information about the country that owned the facility where the two USN airships landed as their final destination in 1944.
