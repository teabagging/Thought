''\\n\\n- The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company or White Star Line of Boston Packers, more commonly known as just White Star Line, was a prominent British shipping company.\\nFounded in 1845, the line operated a fleet of clipper ships that sailed between Britain and Australia. Today it is most famous for their innovative vessel \\"Oceanic\\" of 1870, and the Olympic class ocean liners, including the ill-fated RMS \\"Titanic\\".\\n\\n- The American Line was a shipping company founded in 1871 and based in Philadelphia. It began as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, although the railroad got out of the shipping business soon after founding the company. In 1902, it became part of the International Navigation Co., with the American Line generally handling traffic between the United States ports of Philadelphia and New York City and the British ports of Liverpool and Southampton. Sister company Red Star Line handled traffic between America and the European continent, primarily through Antwerp, Belgium. The company's most prominent president was Clement Griscom, who led the company from 1888 to 1902 and worked as a company executive for its entire existence. During its existence, the company was the largest American shipping company, rivalled only by the smaller, Baltimore-based Atlantic Transport Lines, although this distinction is a marginal one, as all American oceanic shipping concerns were dwarfed by British companies such as the White Star Line or Cunard Line and German ones such as HAPAG.\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south.

Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region.\\n\\n- Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.\\n\\n- The Red Star Line was an ocean passenger line founded in 1871 as a joint venture between the International Navigation Company of Philadelphia, which also ran the American Line, and the Société Anonyme de Navigation Belgo-Américaine of Antwerp, Belgium. The company's main ports of call were Antwerp in Belgium, Liverpool and Southampton in the United Kingdom and New York City and Philadelphia in the United States. The company operated until 1935 when, due to the economic depression, it ceased trading. Its assets were eventually sold to the Holland-America Line.\\n\\n- The Pennsylvania Railroad was an American Class I railroad, founded in 1846. Commonly referred to as the \\"Pennsy,\\" the PRR was headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\n\\n- The Inman Line was one of the three largest 19th - century British passenger shipping companies on the North Atlantic , along with the White Star Line and Cunard Line . Founded in 1850 , it was absorbed in 1893 into American Line . The firm 's formal name for much of its history was the Liverpool , Philadelphia and New York Steamship Company , but it was also variously known as the Liverpool and Philadelphia Steamship Company , as Inman Steamship Company , Limited , and , in the last few years before absorption , as the Inman and International Steamship Company . By embracing new technology , Inman Line became the first to show that unsubsidized ocean liners could profitably cross the North Atlantic . With its first steamer , City of Glasgow of 1850 , Inman led the drive to replace wood - hulled paddle steamers with iron - hulled screw - propelled ships . In 1852 , Inman established that steerage passengers could be transported in steamships . Inman 's City of Paris of 1866 was the first screw liner that could match the speed of the paddlers . By 1870 , Inman landed more passengers in New York than any other line . In 1886 , the US - owned International Navigation Company bought the company . The new owners began updating the express fleet with two Blue Riband winners , City of New York and the second City of Paris , ushering in the double - screw era that ended the need for auxiliary sails .\\n\\n- Southampton, on the south coast of England, is the largest city in the ceremonial county of Hampshire.

Both countries were significant lumber exporters.\\n\\nand a hint : Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering.

Airflow characteristics in the nasopharyngeal airways of an adult male baboon (13.9 kg body wt) were investigated with thermistor probes and the findings compared with flow visualization, using a cinephotographic technique. A clear, acrylic, hollow cast of a baboon nose was made, and thermistor probes were inserted to record air velocity in the cast lumen using a wind tunnel to propel air through the cast. An identical cast was studied by passing water through the cast, with pulses of dye to reveal flow, and cinephotography was used for determination of flow velocities and flow patterns. Flow rates adjusted on the basis of a Reynolds conversion showed good correlations between the two methods, whereas cinephotography revealed areas of turbulence and vortex-like flow not detected by thermistor probes. These results suggest that water flow may provide useful information in complex airways where airflow cannot be determined by other methods. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract contains numerical data about the weights of animals, flow rates recorded with thermistor probes and water flows.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world).

Wilson believes that the island holds vast untapped deposits of oil, a potential fortune which he is determined to secure for Petrox. Unknown to Wilson or the crew, Jack Prescott, a primate paleontologist who wants to see the island for himself, has stowed away on the expedition's vessel, the Petrox Explorer. Prescott reveals himself when he warns the crew that the cloud bank may be caused by some unknown, and potentially dangerous, phenomenon. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, believing him to be a corporate spy from a rival oil company. While being escorted to lock-up, Prescott spots a life raft which, upon inspection, is found to be carrying the beautiful and unconscious Dwan. After conducting a thorough background check on the 'spy', Wilson realizes that he is telling the truth and appoints Prescott as the expedition's official photographer, requesting that, due to his medical training, he be present when Dwan revives.

He is shown playing the keyboard in the original open for the 1980s series. He was also shown playing guitar in a 1980s Hardee's commercial.  Simon is often implied to have a crush on Jeanette, as she is like him in many details; wearing glasses and blue and purple attire and having a high IQ, possibly rivalling his own. However, he seems braver in standing up to siblings than her because Jeanette doesn't often stand up for herself when Brittany pushes her around, but like Simon to Alvin, Jeanette shares a sisterly bond with Brittany. In one animated episode, a chemistry experiment gone wrong resulted in Simon becoming a handsome, Casanova-like romancer. He called himself \\"Mr. Heartthrob\\" (an obvious parody of Mr. Hyde), and enchanted every girl he met before being returned to normal.  Like his brothers, he was originally voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. In the animated series and film, he was voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Jr. Matthew Gray Gubler voiced Simon in the live-action/animated film series.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"who was simon seville?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"In addition to having an IQ just north of Einstein, Simon possesses a dry sense of humor as well as keen wit.","rationale":"The context provides a description of Simon Seville, who is the middle child in The Chipmunks.

Passage 1:Greek letter organizations (GLOs) first appeared at the university in 1847 when two men visiting from Yale University installed a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon. When DKE members began holding secret meetings in the old state capitol building that year, the administration strongly voiced its disapproval. Over a few more decades, 7 other fraternities appeared at UA: Alpha Delta Phi in 1850, Phi Gamma Delta in 1855, Sigma Alpha Epsilon in 1856 (this was the founding chapter), Kappa Sigma in 1867, Sigma Nu in 1874, Sigma Chi in 1876, and Phi Delta Theta in 1877. Anti-fraternity laws were imposed that year, but were lifted in the 1890s. Women at the university founded the Zeta chapter of Kappa Delta sorority in 1903. Alpha Delta Pi soon followed.\\n Passage 2:Heutz joined Imperial College London in 2007 as a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellow. She was awarded the 2008 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Silver Medal for her research on organic thin films. In particular she had developed new electron - donor morphologies for efficient solar cells. Heutz specialises in the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to monitor unpaired electrons within materials. She used EPR to monitor spins within copper phthalocyanine solar cells. Whilst working on new materials for photovoltaics, Heutz showed that electrons in copper phthalocyanine (a blue pigment found in a Bank of England £5 note) exist in a superposition of two different spin states. She demonstrated that copper phthalocyanine could be used for quantum computing, where information is stored as qubits as opposed to binary bits.\\n Passage 3:Born in Kidbrooke, London, Stanislas first joined West Ham United as a schoolboy at the age of 10. In May 2006, Stanislas signed a three-year academy scholarship. He made his Premier Academy League debut in a 3–2 defeat to Watford on 8 April 2006, at the age of 16. He became a regular for the Academy in the 2006–07 season, appearing 26 times and scoring 9 goals as West Ham finished as runners-up to Arsenal. He carried his goalscoring form into the 2007–08 season, scoring 10 goals in 24 appearances. He made his Premier Reserve League debut on 29 August 2007, in a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. His first goals came in the 8–0 rout over Derby County, as he netted a brace. He was part of the first-team squad that travelled to North America in the summer of 2008 for the pre-season tour.

ZFHX1B mutations cause a complex developmental phenotype characterized by severe mental retardation (MR) and multiple congenital defects. We compared the distribution of ZFHX1B transcripts during mouse and human embryogenesis as well as in adult mice and humans. This showed that this gene is strongly transcribed at an early stage in the developing peripheral and central nervous systems of both mice and humans, in all neuronal regions of the brains of 25-week human fetuses and adult mice, and at varying levels in numerous nonneural tissues. Northern blot analysis suggested that ZFHX1B undergoes tissue-specific alternative splicing in both species. These results strongly suggest that ZFHX1B determines the transcriptional levels of target genes in various tissues through the combinatorial interactions of its isoforms with different Smad proteins.

Passage:Roth hired 19-year-old guitar virtuoso Jason Becker to replace Vai prior to recording his third solo LP, A Little Ain't Enough. A straight-ahead hard rock album produced by Bob Rock (who had just produced Metallica's self-titled album), A Little Ain't Enough achieved RIAA gold status shortly after its January 1991 release. Before starting a support tour for A Little Ain't Enough, Becker was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, rendering him unable to perform onstage. Guitarist Joe Holmes stood in for Becker during the tour. Later in 1991, Nirvana and grunge rock emerged, altering musical tastes and suddenly making Roth's brand of hard rock seem unfashionable. Roth's band fractured shortly following the tour's completion. With one exception – 1997's well-received DLR Band album, featuring guitarist John 5 and drummer Ray Luzier – until his reconciliation with Van Halen in 2006, Roth would utilize hired-hands and studio musicians on his club and amphitheater solo tours.","target":"b","rationale":"The question is about Jason Becker, who was hired as a guitar virtuoso.

Terrapins do not form a taxonomic unit, and may not be related. Many belong to the families Geoemydidae and Emydidae. \\n\\n- China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\\n\\n- The turtle shell is a highly complicated shield for the ventral and dorsal parts of turtles, tortoises and terrapins (all classified as \\"turtles\\" by zoologists), completely enclosing all the vital organs of the turtle and in some cases even the head. It is constructed of modified bony elements such as the ribs, parts of the pelvis and other bones found in most reptiles. The bone of the shell consists of both skeletal and dermal bone, showing that the complete enclosure of the shell probably evolved by including dermal armor into the rib cage.\\n\\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- Tortoises are a family, Testudinidae, of land-dwelling reptiles in the order Testudines. Tortoises are shielded from predators by a shell. The top part of the shell is the carapace, the underside is the plastron, and the two are connected by the bridge. The carapace is fused to both the vertebrae and ribcage, and tortoises are unique among vertebrates in that the pectoral and pelvic girdles are inside the ribcage rather than outside. Tortoises can vary in size from a few centimeters to two meters. They are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally reclusive animals.\\n\\n- Testudinata is the group of all tetrapods with a true turtle shell . It includes both modern turtles ( Testudines ) and many of their extinct , shelled relatives ( stem - turtles ) . Though it was first coined as the group containing turtles by Klein in 1760 , it was first defined in the modern sense by Joyce and colleagues in 2004 . Testudinata does not include the primitive stem - turtle Odontochelys , which only had the bottom half of a shell .\\n\\n- Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country.

During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\").

The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".\\n\\n- The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.\\n\\n- Odontochelys semitestacea (meaning \\"toothed turtle with a half-shell\\") is a Late Triassic relative of turtles. Prior to the discovery of \\"Pappochelys\\" it was considered the oldest undisputed stem turtle. It is the only known species in the genus Odontochelys and the family Odontochelyidae. \\"O. semitestacea\\" was first described from three 220-million-year-old specimens excavated in Triassic deposits in Guizhou, China.\\n\\n- A dermal bone or membrane bone is a bony structure derived from intramembranous ossification forming components of the vertebrate skeleton including much of the skull, jaws, gill covers, shoulder girdle and fin spines rays (lepidotrichia), and the shell (of tortoises and turtles). In contrast to endochondral bone, dermal bone does not form from cartilage that then calcifies, and it is often ornamented.

The central underground portion of this rail line is the oldest subway section in the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system; the entire rail line covers a large part of the Seoul Capital Area. The underground section between Seoul Station and Cheongnyangni Station, which is referred to as Seoul Metro Line 1, is currently operated by Seoul Metro. The line first opened in 1974 with through services to overground national railroad tracks from Seongbuk Station (now: Kwangwoon University Station) to Incheon and Suwon Stations. At the time, the underground portion of Line 1 run by Seoul Metro was labeled red on maps. On the other hand, the remaining sections of the rail line run by Korail were labeled either blue or gray on maps, and the express lines were red. In 2000, the adjacent through-running Korail lines were officially bundled together as part of a greater Line 1, and the labeling on maps was changed to the current dark blue color. Commuter railway service was extended to Sinchang in December 2008.\\n\\n- Incheon International Airport (IIA) (sometimes referred to as SeoulIncheon International Airport) is the largest airport in South Korea, the primary airport serving the Seoul Capital Area, and one of the largest and busiest airports in the world. Since 2005, it has been rated the best airport worldwide by Airports Council International every year. It is also rated as the world's cleanest airport and the world's best international transit airport by Skytrax.\\n\\n- Seoul Subway Line 7 of the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation was built 1990-96 (Jangam-Konkuk Univ.) and was completed August 1, 2000 (central section 17 km. Konkuk University to Sinpung); the western section between Sinpung and Onsu was put into service on February 29, 2000.

Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage.\\nSeafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s.

Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales.

They both get lots of snow during winter, but the lake effect snow which adds feet of snow to the yearly total, lingers much longer on the eastern side of the lake.\\n\\nHint: Lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.[1]\\n\\nThe same effect also occurs over bodies of salt water, when it is termed ocean-effect or bay-effect snow. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.","target":"Trip","rationale":"While Hammond and Trip both get lots of snow during winter, the lake effect snow which adds feet of snow to the yearly total lingers much longer on the eastern side of the lake. This is because when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder air above and freezes; it deposits at a rate that produces narrow but very intense bands of precipitation (lake-effect), resulting in more total amount for Eastern cities such as Hammond.\\nSince there's less time for Lake Michigan’s warm surface waters to fuel additional storms over Western shores like Trip City compared with those farther east along its shoreline due to their closer proximity to Chicago where temps are cooler most often"},{"source":"I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened.\\n\\nAnswer this question please: Will Kim's mutation or Holly's mutation have less of an impact on a developing zygote?","target":"Holly's mutation","rationale":"Kim has had a mutation in her sex cell. Since this is the case, Kim's mutation will be found in all of (and only) the cells that are produced from fertilization of her gamete with an egg. Holly has had a mutation in somatic cells and these mutations cannot be passed to offspring since it does not occur in germline or sexual tissue; therefore, if Holly were to conceive a child, the developing zygote would have no trace of Hollys' DNA\\nTherefore, Holly's mutation will likely have less impact on a developing zygote."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a dialogue between a user and an assistant, where users and assistants converse about geographic topics like geopolitical entities and locations.

While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Would engine A have higher or lower temperature than engine B?","target":"higher","rationale":"Based on the background information, vapor pressure is proportional to temperature. Since Keith wanted a higher speed for both locomotives and he needed to increase their vapor pressures by increasing the temperatures of engines A and B, engine A must have had a high initial temperature before being heated further while engine B would require more heating than what was already present in order to achieve its desired speeds. As such, engine A has had a higher starting temperature as compared with that of engine B's so it will also have a higher final temperature after heating up as per Keith's instructions.\\nThe answer is therefore \\"higher\\"."},{"source":"Classify the given a piece of financial news into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \\nQuestion: According to legend, the lost civilization of Atlantis was located on or near what archipelago? \\nIs it Portugal?","target":"No","rationale":"The legend of Atlantis is a story that has been passed down through generations.

Even after I ask the delivery person if they got all the sauces, they will still be missing or wrong. It got the point to where I've called the store and talked to the manager, he assures me it won't happen again and it does. So I started telling the drivers the next time they forget my sauce they won't be getting a tip. Now I used to be a driver too, so I know sometimes you forget things or the person on cut table didn't put the sauce in the box like they said they did. So I started putting in the driver instructions that I won't tip them if they forget my sauce. Nothing else I say or do seems to help. So last night, it happened. I ordered 11 extra sauces. I ask the driver when he gets there if he got all my sauce, he hands me a bag. Normally that's where I tip them but after getting it wrong so many times, I have to check. So I open it and check them, not only is the total count short by 2, missing 1 of the marinara cups and the only cup of icing for the dessert, all 4 cups that were supposed to be mango habanero were instead ranch that I ordered zero of. So out of 11 sauces I ordered and paid for, I only got 5 of them correct. \\n\\nBeing an ex driver myself, I didn't want it to come to this. But it had gone too far. I handed him back the ranch that I didn't order and told him I won't be tipping because the sauces were wrong yet again and that next time if they wanted a tip, my order should be correct.\\n\\nTLDR.

This has happened multiple times, and the author is frustrated that the delivery drivers do not seem to care about getting their orders correct. The author tried different ways of ensuring that their order would be correct, including asking for confirmation from the driver and leaving a note in their order instructing them about how to get a tip. However, these methods were unsuccessful. After trying several different things to ensure accuracy, it seems reasonable that the author decided not to tip anymore if any of their items were missing or wrong after they asked for confirmation and left instructions with the driver on how they could get a tip. It is important for businesses to treat customers' requests seriously in order to ensure customer satisfaction while also promoting good business practices.

Luigi had been naturalized French as Louis about 1550, and married the heiress of the duchies of Nevers and Rethel in 1566. For the French Crown Nevers, a French peer, would naturally be preferable as ruler in Mantua. Nevers arrived there in January 1628 and was proclaimed its sovereign. There were two rival claimants. One was Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, whose daughter Margaret was the widow of Francis IV. Although their son had died an infant in 1612, it was their elder daughter Maria  who had married Charles de Nevers in 1627. Charles Emmanuel based his right to Mantua on his daughter's claim to a substantial portion of the Gonzaga realm, the duchy of Montferrat, which was demonstrably heritable by females since the Gonzagas had acquired it through marriage to Margherita Paleologa in 1540. The other claimant was Ferrante II, Duke of Guastalla, a distant Gonzaga cousin who voiced his claim but did not immediately place troops in the field. He was, however, supported by Emperor Ferdinand II, whose wife at the time, Eleanor of Mantua the elder , had been the sister of the last three Dukes of Mantua. He sought to re-attach the Duchy of Mantua to the Holy Roman Empire; Ferrante being in the Imperial-Spanish camp, was a useful tool to that purpose. But as the Thirty Years' War wore on, it affected dynastic alliances. Charles Emmanuel obtained support from the Habsburgs, who controlled Milan.

The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial.  He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in...","target":"Messiaen","rationale":"The article mentions that Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial and arranged for a visit in spring 1972, where he was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah to compose Des canyons aux étoiles...\\nGiven this context, it is highly likely that \\"Messiaen\\" is the person who fulfilled this specific commission as mentioned in the question.

At the beginning of World War II, Lamarr and composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes, which used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. Although the US Navy did not adopt the technology until the 1960s, the principles of their work are arguably incorporated into Bluetooth technology, and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of CDMA and Wi-Fi.\\nContext: Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, the only child of Gertrud \\"Trude\\" Kiesler (nee Lichtwitz; 1894-1977) and Emil Kiesler (1880-1935). Her father was born to a Jewish family in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine) and was a successful bank director.  Her mother Gertrud was a pianist and Budapest native who came from an upper-class Jewish family; she had converted from Judaism to Catholicism and was described as a \\"practicing Christian\\", who raised her daughter as a Christian. Lamarr helped get her mother out of Austria (then under Nazi domination) and to the United States, and she later became an American citizen. Gertrud Kiesler put \\"Hebrew\\" as her race on her petition for naturalization as an American citizen.  In the late 1920s, Lamarr was discovered as an actress and brought to Berlin by producer Max Reinhardt. Following her training in the theater, she returned to Vienna to work in the film industry, first as a script girl, and soon as an actress. In early 1933, at age 18, she starred in Gustav Machaty's film, Ecstasy (Ekstase in German, Extase in Czech). Her role was that of a neglected young wife married to an indifferent older man. The film became both celebrated and notorious for showing Lamarr's face in the throes of orgasm as well as close-up and brief nude scenes, a result of her being \\"duped\\" by the director and producer, who used high-power telephoto lenses.  Although she was dismayed and now disillusioned about taking other roles, the film gained world recognition after winning an award in Rome. Throughout Europe, the film was considered an artistic work, while in America, it was considered overly sexual and received negative publicity, especially among women's groups. It was banned there and in Germany.  She went on to play a number of stage roles, including a starring one in Sissy, a play about Austrian royalty produced in Vienna, which won accolades from critics. Admirers sent roses to her dressing room and tried to get backstage to meet her. She sent most of them away, including a man who was more insistent, Friedrich Mandl. He became obsessed with getting to know her. She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial status. Her parents, both of Jewish descent, did not approve, due to Mandl's ties to Mussolini, and later, Hitler, but could not stop the headstrong Hedy.\\nQuestion: In what films did Lamarr appear?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"she starred in Gustav Machaty's film, Ecstasy (Ekstase in German, Extase in Czech).","rationale":"The context states that \\"In early 1933, at age 18, she starred in Gustav Machaty's film, Ecstasy (Ekstase in German, Extase in Czech).\\".\\nTherefore the answer is: She stared in Gustav Machaty's film 'Ecstasy'.\\""},{"source":"What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who directed a performance of \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\" at Eothen? from the following article ?\\n\\nDescriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother.  In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

The most you can say about anyone's preference is that it's one person's opinion. But because the two big cola companies--Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola are marketed so aggressively, we've wondered how big a role taste preference actually plays in brand loyalty. We set up a taste test that challenged people who identified themselves as either Coca-Cola or Pepsi fans: Find your brand in a blind tasting.\\nWe invited staff volunteers who had a strong liking for either Coca-Cola Classic   or Pepsi, Diet   Coke, or Diet Pepsi. These were people who thought they'd have no trouble telling their brand from the other brand.\\nWe eventually located 19 regular cola drinkers and 27 diet cola drinkers. Then we fed them four unidentified samples of cola one at a time, regular colas for the one group, diet versions for the other. We asked them to tell us whether each sample was Coke or Pepsi; then we analyzed the records statistically to compare the participants' choices with what mere guess-work could have accomplished.\\nGetting all four samples right was a tough test, but not too tough, we thought, for people who believed they could recognize their brand. In the end, only 7 out of 19 regular cola drinkers correctly identified their brand of choice in all four trials. The diet-cola drinkers did a little worse----only 7 of 27 identified all four samples correctly.\\nWhile both groups did better than chance would predict, nearly half the participants in each group made the wrong choice two or more times. Two people got all four samples wrong. Overall, half the participants did about as well on the last round of tasting as on the first, so tiredness, or taste _ , was not a factor.

Robert is young, while Michael is middle-aged.\\n\\nWho is more likely to produce sperm with an achondroplasis mutation?\\n\\nHint: For autosomal dominant disorders, a person with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to their offspring. For achondroplasia, this means there will be a 50% chance that each child will have achondroplasia. Since two copies are fatal, if two people with achondroplasia have a child, there is a 25% chance of the child dying shortly after birth, a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, and a 25% chance the child will have a normal phenotype. However, in 3 out of 4 cases, people with achondroplasia are born to parents who don't have the condition. This is the result of a new mutation. New achondroplasis mutations are associated with increasing paternal age (over 35 years). Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis. More than 98% of achondroplasia is caused by a G to A point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the FGFR3 gene, which causes a glycine to arginine substitution. This makes this particular nucleotide one of the most, if not the most, mutable base in the human genome.","target":"Michael","rationale":"The question states that Robert is young, while Michael is middle-aged. This implies that Michael has been alive longer than Robert and therefore his sperm have had more time to potentially undergo a mutation (such as G to A point mutation). Since two copies of the mutated gene lead to death shortly after birth, there would be no way for this father with an achondroplasia mutation in his sperm to pass it on if he were himself born with such mutations. It can also be inferred from the context that both fathers want children who will not die shortly after being born due to genetic defects. If they wanted healthy children then they are unlikely themselves already displaying any symptoms related to Achondroplasis since these would likely prevent them from raising their own child into adulthood\\nSo based on this"},{"source":"What is the solution to this math problem?\\nSolve -771*q = 927*q + 157914 for q.","target":"-93","rationale":"To solve for q, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.\\n\\nStarting with:\\n\\n -771*q = 927*q + 157914 \\nSubtracting (927) from both sides:\\n\\n (-1798)*q =157914  \\nDividing by (-1798):\\n\\n q= -93 \\tTherefore, the solution is x=-1/3."},{"source":"Mark and his brother Jeffrey have to leave their cars outside because their parents' cars take up the entire garage.

Humans call Lycans \\"Non-Humans\\" and Vampires are called \\"The infected.\\"12 years later, it is revealed that human governments all over the world had committed genocides to vampires and lycans, killing everything. Surviving populations were reduced to being scavengers and guerrillas. 90% of the vampire race was annihilated. Selene is freed from cryogenic suspension and escapes the medical corporation Antigen. The corporation is trying to make an antidote for the virus that creates vampires and lycans. Selene starts to have strange visions after her escape, which she follows, believing them to be linked to her lover, the vampire-lycan hybrid Michael Corvin. The visions lead her into a building where she runs into David, a fellow vampire.While talking to David, Selene has another vision. Following the vision, she discovers not Michael, but a young girl called only \\"Subject 2,\\" also known as Eve. Later revealed to be a hybrid and Selene and Michael's daughter. David, noting that Eve (Subject 2) has been injured by the lycans and is somehow not healing, takes them to his coven. David's father, Thomas, does not welcome Selene and Eve, stunning Selene with the news that Michael died twelve years ago and that Selene was the cause for the destruction of the vampire race. Upon being given some vampire blood, Eve heals extremely quickly.Dr. Jacob Lane, director of Antigen, is revealed to be a lycan alongside his son, Quint. The \\"antidote\\" the corporation has been working on for many years is actually to make lycans immune to the deadly effects of silver and to enhance their physical abilities.

This intriguing story is another example of how small-scale physics can explain large-scale phenomena. Radioactive dating plays a role in determining the approximate age of the Earth. The oldest rocks on Earth solidified about 3.5×10 9 years ago—a number determined by uranium-238 dating. These rocks could only have solidified once the surface of the Earth had cooled sufficiently. The temperature of the Earth at formation can be estimated based on gravitational potential energy of the assemblage of pieces being converted to thermal energy. Using heat transfer concepts discussed in Thermodynamics it is then possible to calculate how long it would take for the surface to cool to rock9 9 formation temperatures. The result is about 10 years. The first rocks formed have been solid for 3.5×10 years, so that 9 the age of the Earth is approximately 4.5×10 years. There is a large body of other types of evidence (both Earth-bound and solar system characteristics are used) that supports this age. The puzzle is that, given its age and initial temperature, the center of the Earth should be much cooler than it is today (see Figure 31.26).\\n\\n\\nQ: What method plays a role in determining the approximate age of the earth and makes use of uranium?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"radioactive dating","rationale":"In this paragraph, we are not told about any other methods of dating the earth.

When help arrived, Cline insisted that the other car's driver be treated first. She later said she saw the female driver of the other car die before her eyes. West witnessed this too, and the impression left upon her may have contributed to an unfortunate decision she made some three decades later. In 1991, when West was seriously injured in a car accident, she insisted that her driver be treated first. West died from her injuries, possibly because she had declined to be treated immediately. Cline spent a month in the hospital, suffering from a jagged cut across her forehead that required stitches, a broken wrist, and a dislocated hip. Her friend Billy Walker, who died in a vehicle accident in 2006, said Cline rededicated her life to Christ while in the hospital, where she received thousands of cards and flowers from fans.

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut.

His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.\\nLess is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.\\nLochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral...., what would be the answer ?","target":"Stefan","rationale":"The name Stefan Lochner is mentioned in the first and second paragraphs of the article.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]","target":"specimen B","rationale":"The two specimens of fungi, specimen A and B were both found in locations where there was moisture.

We would roast each other and stuff. She would often out-roast me because she would talk about my mother and sister saying how they are all whores. There was nothing I could do because If I roasted her family I knew she would get upset and try to fight me or something like that, so I just let her roast my family. This would happen everyday in school, and it got to the point where I didn’t want to go to school because of her and everyone would laugh at me because her jokes were funny. So eventually, I just stopped being her friend. She saw this and asked me why I stopped being her friend. I ignored her. Then she said is it because I make fun of your family? I’ll stop. Then. I was relieved but she still continued to do it anyways. She’d even make fun of my dead aunt with her friend and they would both gang up on me. So one day, I just had it. One day in science class she said something about my gf at that time and I lost it. I said fuck you and you’re dead cousin and we ended up arguing. I just kept saying fuck that guy and she would say that my gf sucks dick. We were removed from class and she had wanted to fight like I had predicted. She was also crying.

After both teams punted on their opening drive, the Raiders reached the Patriots 31 and struck first blood on a 49-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. After both teams punted again, the Patriots embarked on a 15 play, 84-yard drive, converting four third-downs,  and scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski midway through the second quarter to take a 7-3 lead. The Raiders punted on their next drive, and Marquette King punted only 22 yards to midfield. With the great field position, the Patriots drove all the way to the Raiders 2, but their red zone struggles continued, and they settled for a 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving them a 10-3 lead at halftime. Strong defense continued in the second half. The Raiders drove deep into Patriots territory early in the second quarter, but could only score on a 37-yard field goal by Janikowski. Following a Patriots punt, the Raiders drove from their own 14, to the Patriots 37, but a false start penalty on guard Donald Penn made it 3rd-and-15, and then Carr completed a 13-yard pass to James Jones to the Patriots 29, bringing up a 4th-and-2. The Raiders decided to settle with Janikowski's 47 yard field goal, making the score 10-9. Matthew Slater returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to the Patriots 41. With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13-9 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, Darren McFadden scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard Gabe Jackson. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by Vince Wilfork with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots. Tom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots).

Medroxyprogesterone did not alter significantly the total time of apnea or the total time for disordered breathing, expressed as percentages of total sleep time. Arterial oxygen desaturation during apnea and disordered breathing did not change with treatment.

If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer.

It is not known, however, to what extent different stimuli can induce spasm in the same patient. To investigate whether coronary arterial spasm results from specific abnormal agonist-receptor interactions or from a local nonspecific coronary supersensitivity to different stimuli, 28 patients with vasospastic angina were submitted to a series of diverse vasoconstrictive stimuli known to provoke coronary spasm. Ergonovine, hyperventilation, handgrip, cold pressor, and exercise-tests, were carried out in all 28 patients. In the last 15 patients histamine was also administered. Spasm was provoked by ergonovine in 96% of patients, by hyperventilation in 54%, by histamine in 47%, by exercise in 46%, and by the cold pressor and handgrip tests in 11% and 7%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the responses to provocative tests of patients with normal coronary arteries or nonsignificant stenoses and those with significant lesions. In the same individual, spasm was induced by at least two vasoconstrictive stimuli, although with a different mechanism of action, in 82% of patients and spasm was induced by three or more stimuli in 39%. Tests were repeated in at least 23 patients and short-term reproducibility paralleled sensitivity.

After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\".

One way to make a code is to represent each letter of the alphabet by a different number. Then you can send a coded message by writing words as strings of digits. This is similar to how information is encoded using an electric current. The voltage of the current is changed rapidly and repeatedly to encode a message, called an electronic signal. There are two different types of electronic signals: analog signals and digital signals. Both are illustrated in Figure 23.20. A digital signal consists of pulses of voltage, created by repeatedly switching the current off and on. This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0s (current off) and 1s (current on). This is called a binary (\\"two-digit\\") code. DVDs, for example, encode sounds and pictures as digital signals. An analog signal consists of continuously changing voltage in a circuit. For example, microphones encode sounds as analog signals. Electronic components are the parts used in electronic devices such as computers. The components transmit and change electric current. They are made of materials called semiconductors. A semiconductor is a solid crystalusually consisting mainly of siliconthat can conduct current better than an electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor. Very small amounts of other elements, such as boron or phosphorus, are added to the silicon so it can conduct current. A semiconductor is illustrated in Figure 23.21. There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type. An n-type semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as phosphorus that gives the silicon crystal extra electrons. An n-type semiconductor is like the negative terminal in a chemical cell. A p-type semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged holes where electrons are missing. A p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal in a chemical cell. Electronic components contain many semiconductors. Types of components include diodes, transistors, and inte- grated circuits. Each type is described in Table 23.2. Electronic Component Diode Transistor Integrated Circuit (Microchip) Description A diode consists of a p-type and an n-type semicon- ductor placed side by side. When a diode is connected by leads to a source of voltage, electrons flow from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor. This is the only direction that electrons can flow in a diode. This makes a diode useful for changing alternating current to direct current. A transistor consists of three semiconductors, either p- n-p or n-p-n. Current cant flow through a transistor unless a small amount of current is applied to the center semiconductor (through the base). Then a much larger current can flow through the transistor from end to end (from collector to emitter). This means that a transmitter can be used as a switch, with pulses of a small current turning a larger current on and off. A transistor can also be used to increase the amount of current flowing through a circuit. You can learn more about transistors and how they work at this URL: http An integrated circuitalso called a microchipis a tiny, flat piece of silicon that consists of layers of elec- tronic components such as transistors. An integrated circuit as small as a fingernail can contain millions of electronic components. Current flows extremely rapidly in an integrated circuit because it doesnt have far to travel. You can learn how microprocessors are made at this URL: Many of the devices you commonly use are electronic. Electronic devices include computers, mobile phones, TV remotes, DVD and CD players, game systems, MP3 players, and digital cameras. All of these devices use electric current to encode, analyze, or transmit information. Consider the computer as an example of an electronic device. A computer contains microchips with millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded as 0s and 1s and transmitted as electrical pulses.

With the divorce rate up to about 50%, divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. Custody disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent. In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can have a positive effect on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers who grow up in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time. Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory, which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training. A parental divorce during childhood or adolescence continues to have a negative effect when a person is in his or her twenties and early thirties. These negative effects include romantic relationships and conflict style, meaning as adults, they are more likely to use the styles of avoidance and competing in conflict management.\\n\\nWhat new theory states that traumatic events during adolescence have lifelong effects?","target":"epistemological trauma theory","rationale":"The passage mentions a new theory called the \\"adolescent epistemological trauma theory\\", which states that traumatic events during adolescence have lifelong effects.

But I don’t believe you have to have a lot for it to become burdensome. Money has always seemed to be a burden. Either you have it and the obligation and responsibility becomes a burden (so I’ve been told, ha) or you don’t have it and life without money becomes a burden. I guess money became a burden to me when I started paying my own bills.\\nLet me explain. I raised my 2 girls by myself. I was fortunate to have a good job as an office manager for a doctor in Dallas. I was able to pay my bills and juggle things around to afford what the girls needed for school and what not. When I didn’t have money for something they wanted I felt like I carried the world on my shoulders. I didn’t let them know how stressful it all was because I felt like it was none of their business. They were kids and needed to be kids. They would soon enough be feeling the stress of managing their own household and shouldn’t be asked to help shoulder that burden as kids.\\nOnce, me and my youngest daughter, who was an adult at this time, went to a drive in fast food place and got a couple of drinks. My daughter was treating me and when the car hop came to deliver the drinks, my daughter gave her $5.00 as a tip, which was more than the drinks! I, of course, asked why she did that and she told me that they live off their tips and she knew what that was like having been a waitress before. I said something about her needing the money as well and how money makes the world go around. She said “No, Mom, you can be dead-assed broke and the world is still going to go around.”\\nThat was when I quit letting money be a burden.\\nQuestion: Who raised two girls alone?\\nAnswer:","target":"the author","rationale":"The context describes the experience of the author, who raised their two daughters by themselves.

Conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to the cullin subunit (neddylation) positively regulates activity of SCF complexes, most likely by increasing their affinity for the E2 conjugated to ubiquitin. The Nedd8 conjugation pathway is required in C. elegans embryos for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the microtubule-severing protein MEI-1/Katanin at the meiosis-to-mitosis transition. Genetic experiments suggest that this pathway controls the activity of a CUL-3-based E3 ligase. Counteracting the Nedd8 pathway, the COP9/signalosome has been shown to promote deneddylation of the cullin subunit. However, little is known about the role of neddylation and deneddylation for E3 ligase activity in vivo.', 'Here, we identified and characterized the COP9/signalosome in C. elegans and showed that it promotes deneddylation of CUL-3, a critical target of the Nedd8 conjugation pathway. As in other species, the C. elegans signalosome is a macromolecular complex containing at least six subunits that localizes in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Reducing COP9/signalosome function by RNAi results in a failure to degrade MEI-1, leading to severe defects in microtubule-dependent processes during the first mitotic division. Intriguingly, reducing COP9/signalosome function suppresses a partial defect in the neddylation pathway; this suppression suggests that deneddylation and neddylation antagonize each other.","target":"0","rationale":"The passage describes a series of genetic experiments that investigate the roles of neddylation and deneddylation in regulating ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in C. elegans, but it does not state a specific research question or hypothesis that the experiments are designed to test.

We sought to determine if hernia-related factors, such as defect size and re-operative status correlate with postoperative complications, operative times and length of stay (LOS).', 'The study is a retrospective review of 30-day perioperative outcomes following LVHR in 91 patients who underwent surgery at a single institution from August 2009 through June 2012. A single surgeon performed all procedures.', 'Indications for surgery were recurrent incisional hernia in 33\\\\xa0% of patients and primary incisional or ventral abdominal hernias in the rest. Coated polyester mesh with an average size of 348\\\\xa0cm(2) (±214; range 113-1,036) was used. Mean operative time was 132\\\\xa0min (±66.1; range 53-412). The mean LOS was 4.0\\\\xa0days (±3.5; range 1-22). Complications occurred in 13 patients for overall morbidity of 16.5\\\\xa0% and no mortality. There was one recurrence in 30\\\\xa0days (1.1\\\\xa0%). Patients who had a surgery >120\\\\xa0min or a LOS >1\\\\xa0day were statistically more likely to have multiple hernias, larger defect sizes (>40\\\\xa0cm(2)), larger mesh sizes (>300\\\\xa0cm(2)) or a history of recurrent hernia (P\\\\xa0<\\\\xa00.05). No other clinical or demographic variable evaluated in this study correlated with operative time or LOS.\\nAnswer: LVHR is safe with a low incidence of perioperative complications.

For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \\"subject\\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \\"object\\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \\"subject-object identity,\\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \\"God\\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality—and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \\"self-realization\\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \\"object\\" it observes is something \\"alien,\\" meaning something separate or apart from \\"subject.\\" In Hegel's words, \\"The object is revealed to it [to \\"subject\\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \\"object\\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes Absolute Spirit, the \\"finite\\" (man, human) becomes the \\"infinite\\" (\\"God,\\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \\"picture-thinking\\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \\"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\\" The picture Hegel presents is \\"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\\"","target":"Idealism","rationale":"The paragraph deals mainly with the concept of Idealism, which is a philosophical system that regards ideas as constituting reality. \\nIt also explains how Hegelian idealism believes in self-realization and points out to some criticisms against this school of thought."},{"source":"Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A woman wearing a red scarf is standing on a hill by a winding road.\\", is the sentence \\"The woman is in teh house.\\" a true sentence?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The sentence does not have enough information to say whether the woman is in a house or not."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it.

It was directed by Rupert Sanders, and post-production was conducted by Asylum.

In the case of electrons in atoms, it can be stated as follows: it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers: \\"n\\", the principal quantum number, ', the angular momentum quantum number, \\"m\\", the magnetic quantum number, and \\"m\\", the spin quantum number. For example, if two electrons reside in the same orbital, and if their \\"n\\", ', and \\"m\\" values are the same, then their \\"m\\" must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spins of 1/2 and -1/2. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin-statistics theorem of 1940.\\n\\n- In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).\\n\\n- A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothingnot even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as lightcan escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.\\n\\n- A supernova is an astronomical event that occurs during the last stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion. This causes the sudden appearance of a \\"new\\" bright star, before slowly fading from sight over several weeks or months. \\n\\n- The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.\\n\\n- The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is  (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:\\n\\n- Gravitational collapse is the contraction of an astronomical object due to the influence of its own gravity, which tends to draw matter inward toward the center of mass. Gravitational collapse is a fundamental mechanism for structure formation in the universe. Over time an initial relatively smooth distribution of matter will collapse to form pockets of higher density, typically creating a hierarchy of condensed structures such as clusters of galaxies, stellar groups, stars and planets.\\n\\n- A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star. It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric.\\n\\n- A bipolar outflow represents two continuous flows of gas from the poles of a star. Bipolar outflows may be associated with protostars (young, forming stars), or with evolved post-AGB stars (often in the form of bipolar nebulae).\\n\\n- Vela X- 1 is a pulsing , eclipsing high - mass X-ray binary ( HMXB ) system , associated with the Uhuru source 4U 0900 - 40 and the supergiant star HD 77581 . The X-ray emission of the neutron star is caused by the capture and accretion of matter from the stellar wind of the supergiant companion . Vela X- 1 is the prototypical detached HMXB . The orbital period of the system is 8.964 days , with the neutron star being eclipsed for about two days of each orbit by HD 77581 . The spin period of the neutron star is about 283 seconds , and gives rise to strong X-ray pulsations . The mass of the pulsar is estimated to be at least 1.88 ± 0.13 solar masses .\\n\\n- A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole.\\n\\n- X-ray binaries are a class of binary stars that are luminous in X-rays. \\nThe X-rays are produced by matter falling from one component, called the \\"donor\\" (usually a relatively normal star), to the other component, called the \\"accretor\\", which is very compact: a neutron star or black hole. \\nThe infalling matter releases gravitational potential energy, up to several tenths of its rest mass, as X-rays. The lifetime and the mass-transfer rate in an X-ray binary depends on the evolutionary status of the donor star, the mass ratio between the stellar components, and their orbital separation. (Hydrogen fusion releases only about 0.7 percent of rest mass.)\\nAn estimated 10 positrons escape per second from a typical low-mass X-ray binary.\\n\\n- The positron or antielectron is the antiparticle or the antimatter counterpart of the electron. The positron has an electric charge of +1 \\"e\\", a spin of 1/2, and has the same mass as an electron. When a low-energy positron collides with a low-energy electron, annihilation occurs, resulting in the production of two or more gamma ray photons (see electronpositron annihilation).\\n\\n- A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.\\n\\n- A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.\\n\\n- A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called \\"multiple star systems\\". These systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means. Research over the last two centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems.\\n\\n- A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name \\"white dwarf\\" was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922. The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take many billions of years.\\n\\n- The solar mass is a standard unit of mass in astronomy, equal to approximately 1.99 × 10 kilograms. It is used to indicate the masses of other stars, as well as clusters, nebulae and galaxies. It is equal to the mass of the Sun, about two nonillion (two quintillion in the long scale) kilograms:\\n\\n- X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×10 Hz to 3×10 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning Röntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm Röntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \\"X-radiation\\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \\"X-ray(s)\\" in the English language includes the variants \\"x-ray(s)\\", \\"xray(s)\\", and \\"X ray(s)\\".\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'instance of'.","target":"vela x-1 , binary star","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"vela x-1 , binary star\\"."},{"source":"In this subtask, you will answer a simple science question.

Although capable of enhancing the chemotactic activity of native C5a des Arg, the cochemotaxin had no effect on the chemotactic activity of either deglycosylated C5a des Arg, native C5a, or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Of the known components of the oligosaccharide chain, only sialic acid prevented enhancement by the cochemotaxin of the chemotactic activity exhibited by native C5a des Arg.

In fact, I write about both regularly.

By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression.\\nPractices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being\\nAccept Your Feelings\\nStuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode.\\nUnfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs.\\nRather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness.\\nIt takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety.\\nDon’t stuff your emotions!\\nLet yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else).

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.)

Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. \\n\\nQuestion: In which non-Albanian language-family has a raised to o?\\nI found this answer \\"Illyrian\\".

They had levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\\"\\" pic.twitter.com/x5HmX6uogo— Lis Power (@LisPower1) March 30, 2020With respect to the August 13 2020 Bartiromo interview on Fox Business, most clips and transcripts started with “they,” making it not entirely clear which “they” Trump referenced. However, Slate published a partial transcript of the portion of the video about USPS funding and mail-in voting. Bartiromo asked what specifically Democrats were seeking that was “causing a breakdown in any deals”:Bartiromo: What specifically are they pushing for that is causing a breakdown in any deals? Nancy Pelosi said that the Democrats and the White House are still miles apart on any stimulus.Trump responded, indicating “they” were congressional Democrats:Trump: Well they’re right. And it’s their fault. They want $3.5 billion for something that’ll turn out to be fraudulent. That’s election money, basically. They want $3.5 billion for the mail-in votes. Universal mail-in ballots. They want $25 billion—billion—for the post office. Now they need that money in order to have post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots. Now, in the meantime, they aren’t getting there. By the way, those are just two items. But if you don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting. Because they’re not equipped to have it. And you see how bad it’s been with this Carolyn Maloney scam. She scammed her way into an election she probably lost. But they said mail-in ballots, its all mixed up. Paterson, New Jersey, same thing. Yesterday Virginia, 500,000 applications for ballots got sent to everybody, nobody even knows. Got sent to dogs. Got sent to dead people. Nobody has no idea what happened. They said, Oh we made a mistake, I’m sorry. Five hundred thousand ballots sent in Virginia. How do you feel about Virginia going in there when you have 500,000 phony ballot applicants? And this is all over.Bartiromo asked about whether quibbling over USPS funding and infrastructure for mail-in voting was “holding up money for the American people,” referring to stimulus payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. In his second response, Trump confirmed that funding for mail-in voting was at issue in broader negotiations:Bartiromo: This is what’s holding up money for the American people? They want mail-in voting and they want money for the post office? This is one of the sticking points that’s holding back stimulus for Americans during this coronavirus?Trump: That’s one of them. [Cross talk]Trump: That’s one of them. That’s right. Maria, how would you like to have $3.5 billion for mail-in voting. Billion! You know how much that is? Nobody has any idea, you people, Oh, you know, 3½ billion. They want $25 billion for the post office, because the post office is going to have to go to town to get these ridiculous ballots in. You know, there’s nothing wrong with getting out and voting. They voted during World War I and World War II. And they should have voter ID, because the Democrats scam the system. But two of the items are the post office, and $3.5 billion dollars for mail-in voting. Now, if we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting. They just can’t have it. So, you know.As such, the comments Heather Cox Richardson shared were accurate; Trump said Democrats sought money in order to have the post office functioning “so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,” and “if we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money,” and “they can’t have universal mail-in voting … they just can’t have it.” The commentary occurred across exchanges with Bartiromo, in the same short section of an interview on Fox Business.

Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey. The other main category of consumption is detritivory, the consumption of dead organic matter. It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse.

TGEV infection provokes mitochondrial damage of porcine intestinal epthelial cell (IPEC), which is responsible for inflammation and cell death. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that circular RNA circEZH2 was down-regulated during TGEV infection and promoted the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) via targeting miR-22 in porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Activation of NF-κB is an important factor for mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening is a key reason for mitochondrial damage. So, we speculate that circEZH2 may regulate TGEV-induced mPTP opening via NF-kB pathway. In the present study, we found that mPTP opening of IPEC-J2 was occured during TGEV infection and suppressed by circEZH2 via attaching miR-22. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were identified as the targets of miR-22. Silencing HK2 enhanced TGEV-induced mPTP opening, while no effect on NF-κB pathway. Silencing IL-6 promoted TGEV-induced mPTP opening and inhibited NF-κB pathway. Inhibitor of NF-κB increased TGEV-induced mPTP opening. The data revealed that TGEV-induced mPTP opening was regulated via two pathways: circEZH2/miR-22/HK2 axis and circEZH2/miR-22/IL-6/NF-κB axis.","target":"Circular RNA CircEZH2 Suppresses Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus-induced Opening of Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore via Targeting MiR-22 in IPEC-J2","rationale":"The title should be short and concise, but it should also include the main scientific findings of the research.

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n- Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century. \\nIn the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.\\n\\n- The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.\\n\\n- Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or  ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille.

On the Deûle River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region and the prefecture of the Nord department.\\n\\n- France is divided into 18 administrative regions, including 13 metropolitan regions and 5 overseas regions. The 13 metropolitan regions (including 12 mainland regions and Corsica) are each further subdivided into 2 to 13 departments, while the overseas regions consist of only one department each and hence are also referred to as \\"overseas departments\\". The current legal concept of \\"region\\" was adopted in 1982, and in 2016 what had been 27 regions was reduced to 18.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

After CIA coup his father was arrested and sentenced to death. But he escaped from the detention centre and later on moved to the USSR where the Soviet officials granted him political asylum. In the early 60's Schandermani immigrated with his mother to Russia, where family was reunited. In 1961 he went to school in Moscow. Two years later he continued his school education in a special school for foreigners Interdom located in the Russian city Ivanovo. In 1971 he graduated from this school and moved to Dushanbe capitol of the former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan. In 1979 after the fall of the Shah's regime Schandermani went via West-Berlin back to Iran. After his arrival at the Tehran's airport Mehrabad he was arrested and jailed.

However, LSTMs are known to be computationally inefficient because the memory capacity of the models depends on the number of parameters, and the inherent recurrence that models the temporal dependency is not parallelizable. In this paper, we propose simple, but effective, low-rank matrix factorization (MF) algorithms to compress network parameters and significantly speed up LSTMs with almost no loss of performance (and sometimes even gain). To show the effectiveness of our method across different tasks, we examine two settings: 1) compressing core LSTM layers in Language Models, 2) compressing biLSTM layers of ELMo~\\\\citep{ELMo} and evaluate in three downstream NLP tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Textual Entailment, and Question Answering). The latter is particularly interesting as embeddings from large pre-trained biLSTM Language Models are often used as contextual word representations. Finally, we discover that matrix factorization performs better in general, additive recurrence is often more important than multiplicative recurrence, and we identify an interesting correlation between matrix norms and compression performance.","target":"We propose simple, but effective, low-rank matrix factorization (MF) algorithms to speed up in running time, save memory, and improve the performance of LSTMs","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose simple, but effective, low-rank matrix factorization (MF) algorithms to speed up in running time, save memory, and improve the performance of LSTMs."},{"source":"Given a paragraph about cooking, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, generate a relevant question to the topic of the paragraph.

He played the lead role of con-artist and thief Neal Caffrey in the USA Network series White Collar from 2009 to 2014. Bomer won a Golden Globe Award and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his supporting role as Felix Turner, opposite Mark Ruffalo, in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014).\\nContext: Matthew Staton Bomer was born on October 11, 1977 in Webster Groves, Missouri, to Elizabeth Macy (nee Staton) and John O'Neill Bomer IV, a Dallas Cowboys draft pick. His father, John Bomer, played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1972 to 1974. He has a sister Megan Bomer and a brother Neill Bomer, who is an engineer. Bomer credits his own parents for being understanding when they sensed their young child was a little different from other kids. \\"I've always had an active imagination,\\" says Bomer. He is a distant cousin to American singer Justin Timberlake, with whom he starred in the movie In Time in 2011. Timberlake and Bomer share common descent from Edward Bomer, who was born in 1690. Bomer's ancestry includes English, as well as Welsh, Scots-Irish, Scottish, Irish, Swiss-German, and German.  In 1995, at age 17, Bomer made his professional stage debut as Young Collector in a production of Tennessee Williams A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) staged by Alley Theatre, a company in the Downtown, Houston, at the Texas. A few years later he returned to the stage in 1998 in a re-presentation of the play Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice in the play he lived Issachar - who was represented at the Utah Shakespeare Festival in Cedar City, Utah. Speaking about his first role in a production, Bomer said:  I started acting professionally when I was 17. I quit the team and did a production of A Streetcar Named Desire at the Alley Theatre in Houston. I used to drive down at the end of the school day, do the show, do my homework during intermission and drive an hour back to Spring to go to school the next day.  He grew up in Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston, and attended its Klein High School in 1996, where he was a classmate of future actor Lee Pace and actress Lynn Collins. Pace and Bomer both acted at Houston's Alley Theatre, a non-profit theatre company. Bomer was nurtured throughout middle school by a theater arts teacher who taught him to improvise and give life to the characters he had created in his mind. His senior year, Bomer received a scholarship for some of his monologue performances, which led to his acceptance at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

They are known by their German code names Fall Weiss  and Fall Schwarz , as the Battle of Neretva and the Battle of Sutjeska after the rivers in the areas they were fought, or the Fourth and Fifth Enemy Offensive, respectively, according to former Yugoslav historiography. On 7 January 1943, the Bulgarian 1st Army also occupied south-west Serbia. Savage pacification measures reduced Partisan activity appreciably. Bulgarian infantry divisions participated in the Fifth anti-Partisan Offensive as a blocking force of the Partisan escape-route from Montenegro into Serbia and in the Sixth anti-Partisan Offensive in Eastern Bosnia. Negotiations between Germans and Partisans started on 11 March 1943 in Gornji Vakuf, Bosnia. Tito's key officers Vladimir Velebit, Koča Popović and Milovan Đilas brought three proposals, first about an exchange of prisoners, second about the implementation of international law on treatment of prisoners and third about political questions.  The delegation expressed concerns about the Italian involvement in supplying the Chetnik army and stated that the National Liberation Movement is an independent movement, with no aid from the Soviet Union or the UK. Somewhat later, Đilas and Velebit were brought to Zagreb to continue the negotiations. In the Fourth Enemy Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Neretva or Fall Weiss , Axis forces pushed Partisan troops to retreat from western Bosnia to northern Herzegovina, culminating in the Partisan retreat over the Neretva river.

They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue.\\nJoclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry   was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap   every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845.\\nCoca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red.\\nA spokesperson for Home Depot said research showed that the first thing people thought of was orange when they heard the name of the company.\\nSmaller companies are also realizing the importance of color.

Demand is identified and then satisfied through a supply chain. Attempts are made to increase demand through advertising. In the 2000s, an increasing amount of retailing began occurring online using electronic payment and delivery via a courier or via postal mail.\\nRetailing as a sector includes subordinated services, such as delivery. The term \\"retailer\\" is also applied where a service provider services the small orders of a large number of individuals, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses, or in a shopping mall. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment  protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of electronic-commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions) and mail order.\\n\\n- Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).\\n\\n- The Gulf of Finland  is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea.

The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.\\n\\n- REMA 1000 is a multinational no-frills supermarket chain owned entirely by the Reitan Group (Reitangruppen).

It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898.

Uno-X and Rema Bensin are low-cost brand names of YX.\\n\\n- A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.\\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...\\n\\n- Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.

The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with its own set of nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range. One of the genetic differences between the two subpopulations is the type of mitochondrial DNA found in individual's cells. Individuals from rookeries in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea have a similar type of mitochondrial DNA, and individuals from The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have another type of Mitochondrial DNA. Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30 ° N and 30 ° S. Since green sea turtles are a migrating species, their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The differences in mitochondrial DNA more than likely stems from the populations being isolated from each other by the southern tips of both South America and Africa with no warm waters for the green sea turtles to migrate through. The green sea turtle is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, green sea turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska.

On the first series of the game, the Jets drove to the Patriots' 13-yard line but the game remained scoreless after kicker Jay Feely missed a 31-yard field goal. Eleven plays later, the Patriots faced 3rd-and-goal from the Jets' 2-yard line, but a run for a loss by running back Laurence Maroney set up a 21-yard Gostkowski field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. After a Jets punt, the Patriots extended their lead to 6-0 on a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal early in the second quarter. The Jets responded with a 77-yard drive, highlighted by a 54-yard Laveranues Coles completion from quarterback Brett Favre, which brought them as close to the end zone as the Patriots' 1-yard line, but they again had to settle for a field goal; this time Feely completed the 21-yard attempt to cut the Patriots' lead to 6-3. The Patriots and Jets exchanged punts to end the first half. After a Patriots punt began the second half, the Jets started their next possession from their own 23-yard line. Three offensive penalties later, with the Jets at 2nd-and-25, defensive back Brandon Meriweather earned his first career interception on an errant Favre pass, giving the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 31-yard line. Despite a Kris Jenkins sack of Cassel to begin the drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 22-yard completion to running back Kevin Faulk on a 3rd-and-9 play. Three plays later, Morris ran it in from the Jets' 1-yard-line for a touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 13-3. On an ensuing Jets punt, a 24-yard Faulk return set up the Patriots' next drive at the Jets' 39-yard line; nine plays later, a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 16-3 lead and ended the third-quarter scoring. Beginning from their own 20-yard line for the sixth time in the game, the Jets drove into the Patriots' red zone and then cut the Patriots' lead to 16-10 on a 2-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. The Patriots' next drive went for 71 yards and ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal to build the Patriots' lead to 19-10. This would be the final score, as the Jets' next drive, which included a 20-yard sack of Favre by Adalius Thomas, went three-and-out and the Patriots held the ball for the final 3:45 in the game. The win brought the Patriots' record to 2-0 and kept the team tied for first place in the AFC East.

Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London.\\nNumerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","target":"Diego","rationale":"The Rokeby Venus (also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid) is a painting by Diego Velázquez.\\nThis means that the first name of the person who combined two established poses for venus is \\"Diego\\"."},{"source":"Produce a brief English sentence that would be considered grammatically as category: unacceptable\\nAll categories: OPTIONS:\\n- unacceptable\\n- acceptable","target":"I funneled the mixture to Rina.","rationale":"Here's an example of a grammatically acceptable sentence: I funneled the mixture to Rina."},{"source":"Indicate a text span in the passage about which an inquisitive question is asked.

However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions.

The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted. CIA officers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate.\\" Mike\\" thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting  Bin Laden. The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplomat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \\"Iranian dangers\\" in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States.","target":"Yes","rationale":"Yes, this is the correct answer because of the following text: \\"In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden."},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: What kinds of dogs sometimes have a shape of white fur on their undersides?\\nContext: Domestic dogs often display the remnants of countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern.
