If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of electrochemical reactions.

As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation.

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso.\\nWith a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold.\\nAt every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red.

Greater evidence of such a people is found on Mallorca and Menorca than on Ibiza, but one of the Balearics' most important sites is actually on the island of Formentera, where the megalithic monument/tomb of Ca Na Costa has been dated to 2000 b.c. Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums.

E-cadherin stability depends on F-actin, but the mechanisms regulating actin polymerization at cell-cell junctions remain poorly understood. Here we investigated a role for formin-mediated actin polymerization at cell-cell junctions. We identify mDia1 and Fmnl3 as major factors enhancing actin polymerization and stabilizing E-cadherin at epithelial junctions. Fmnl3 localizes to adherens junctions downstream of Src and Cdc42 and its depletion leads to a reduction in F-actin and E-cadherin at junctions and a weakening of cell-cell adhesion. Of importance, Fmnl3 expression is up-regulated and junctional localization increases during collective cell migration. Depletion of Fmnl3 or mDia1 in migrating monolayers results in dissociation of leader cells and impaired wound repair. In summary, our results show that formin activity at epithelial cell-cell junctions is important for adhesion and the maintenance of epithelial cohesion during dynamic processes, such as wound repair.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not have a topic sentence or key sentence, which is the first and most important element of a structured abstract.

More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.","target":"Cooperation","rationale":"The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to promote peace, security and stability across the whole region.

His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America.  When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia.  He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family.  Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture.  Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia.  This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot.  Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of $9,000 (equal to $147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F.

Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States.

They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture).\\nIn the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\".  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.  As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.\\n\\nGuess a valid title for it!","target":"Funerary art","rationale":"The text describes art that is related to funerary ceremonies.

Heat is another form of electromagnetic radiation (just like light), it takes the same amount of time. it takes 500 seconds or 8m 20s for light from the suns surface to reach earth's surface. heat is the random motion of atoms. when the sun shines it's rays down on earth (elecromagnetic radiation) the atoms absorb this energy and the energy levels of an atom are raised thus creating higher temperatures. Sunlight travels at the speed of light. Photons emitted from the surface of the Sun need to travel across the vacuum of space to reach our eyes. The short answer is that it takes sunlight an average of 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. If the Sun suddenly disappeared from the Universe (not that this could actually happen, don’t panic), it would take a little more than 8 minutes before you realized it was time to put on a sweater. Divide these and you get 500 seconds, or 8 minutes and 20 seconds. This is an average number. Remember, the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, ranging from 147 million to 152 million km. At its closest point, sunlight only takes 490 seconds to reach Earth. And then at the most distant point, it takes 507 seconds for sunlight to make the journey. But the story of light gets even more interesting, when you think about the journey light needs to make inside the Sun. Light moves at 186,000 miles a second and the Sun is 93,000,000 miles away. Do the math. (500 seconds or 8 1/3 minutes) Heat is energy. Heat from the Sun is brought to Earth in the light from the Sun. Sunlight is absorbed by things it strikes, like the ground, and the energy of the light becomes heat energy in the thing that absorbed it. How long does it take the sun's light to reach earth? Asked by: CITO GASTON Answer The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies because the Earth's orbit about the Sun is elliptical.At it's closest, the distance is 91,402,000 miles and it's farthest distance it is 94,512,000 miles.This gives an average distance of 92,957,000 miles. Answer. The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies because the Earth's orbit about the Sun is elliptical.At it's closest, the distance is 91,402,000 miles and it's farthest distance it is 94,512,000 miles.This gives an average distance of 92,957,000 miles. Light travels at 186,282 miles per second. This is an average number. Remember, the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, ranging from 147 million to 152 million km. At its closest point, sunlight only takes 490 seconds to reach Earth. And then at the most distant point, it takes 507 seconds for sunlightto make the journey. Imagine the sun to be a spherical gun shooting photons in all directions. These photons travel at the speed of light in straight lines, and can be characterised as 'rays of light'. What it means to say that light takes approx. 8 minutes to reach the earth from the sun is that these photons take approx. 8 minutes to travel the distance between the earth and the sun at their speed (the speed of light). Why does it take 20,000 years for light to reach the surface of the Sun from its core, but just 8 minutes to reach the surface of the Earth? How long does it take for sunlight to reach earth?

The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass. Stated differently, the RDA for copper in normal healthy adults is quoted as 0.97 mg/day and as 3.0 mg/day. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase. Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin, which carries the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.\\nWhat is the answer to this question: What is copper bound with when it is sent to the liver?","target":"albumin","rationale":"The passage states that copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound with albumin.\\nAlbumins are a family of proteins which make up around 60% of human blood serum.

Half my family is catholic and half is evangelical christian. And of course they have weddings, baptisms, christmas, funerals, etc. But I just can't bring myself to go to these events anymore. It's draining and makes me feel uncomfortable to basically support their beliefs that have caused so much harm to people around the world. The state of organized religion is so dire and I feel they have too much power in my region, messing with the government and working overtime to limit civil liberties of women, minorities and LGBT people. In the past I have attended these events, but it has grown more and more difficult to do it. \\n\\nTo give you an example, at my sister's wedding the pastor spent half the sermon (or whatever it's called) raging against same-sex marriage. And I'm gay. And this happens in almost every of these events: I don't know how they do it but they are able to bring it up. I'm also pro-choice; and of course they are not. Thousands of women have been forced to carry their child after being raped because of the religious influence in the government and the strict abortion laws that we have. That's without mentioning the circle of pedophilia, the belief that I'm a complete sinner and the overall atmosphere of oppression I feel. \\n\\nOf course I'd like to be there for special family gatherings. And I will go to the dinner, party or whatever after it (and usually they are alcohol-free since evangelical christians don't believe in drinking (or dancing!). So, am I the asshole? I'm conflicted. \\n\\nTl,dr: I'm a (gay) atheist in the middle of a huge religious family and attending their religious events has  become too uncomfortable; so I have told them I won't attend anymore.","target":"no","rationale":"The author is an atheist living in a country where religion plays a large role in society.

The philosophy of Pashupata sect was systematized by Lakulish in the 2nd century CE. Paśu in Paśupati refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler. Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to Pāśupatas, soul possesses the attributes of the Supreme Deity when it becomes liberated from the 'germ of every pain'.\\n\\nWhen did Lakulish systematize the Pasupata Shaivism?","target":"2nd century CE","rationale":"The context explains that Pashupata sect is one of the oldest branches of Shaivism, and its philosophy was systematized by Lakulish in 2nd century CE.\\nThus, \\"2nd centuray\\" would be a good answer for this question"},{"source":"Question: What did von Bredow's Pyrrhic victory become known as?\\n\\nIs Von Bredow's attack had succeeded only because of an unusually effective artillery bombardment just before the charge, along with favorable terrain that masked his approach. a good answer to this question?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"Von Bredow's attack succeeded only because of an unusually effective artillery bombardment just before the charge, along with favorable terrain that masked his approach.

Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand.\\nIt was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been.\\nPerhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right?\\nThe living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them.\\n\\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.\\nConflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote?\\nAnd it worked on most people. This woman was not one of them.\\nQuestion: Who was screamed at over the phone?\\nAnswer:","target":"Ray","rationale":"Ray is the character being yelled at on the phone. The context discusses a number of things he has done that are not good or noble, including giving CPR to someone who was no longer alive. He resents this implication because it does not fully understand his actions or motivations and attempts to assert himself by stating that something like saving a child from drowning in shallow water \\"simply did not make sense\\".\\nThe conversation with Ray then continues beyond the excerpt provided where we learn more about him as well as what happens when individuals do not follow rules (they get fired).

The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office.

Changes in clinical features and laboratory findings of KD were evaluated over a period of 10 years. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of KD patients and compared the clinical and laboratory features of two KD patient groups: those admitted from 2000 to 2004 (group A, 284 cases) and those admitted from 2010 to 2014 (group B, 331 cases). Results: There were a total of 615 KD patients (mean age: 29.7 months; male-to-female ratio = 1.6:1), including 228 incomplete KD patients. Incomplete KD patients had milder values in some laboratory indices. The preadmission and total fever durations were longer in group A than in group B. The proportion of incomplete KD was higher in group B, but incidence of coronary artery lesions (CALs) was lower.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.","target":"Ben","rationale":"Mary was nearsighted but Ben had normal vision.\\nThis means that Mary had difficulty seeing distant objects, while Ben did not have a problem with it."},{"source":"Given a story, answer the question about the story.

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.\\n\\n- Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.\\n\\n- Brooklyn is the most populous borough of New York City, with a Census-estimated 2,636,735 residents in 2015. It borders the borough of Queens at the southwestern end of Long Island. Since 1896, Brooklyn has had the same boundaries as Kings County, the most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, and the second-most densely populated county in the United States, after the county of New York (which is coextensive with the borough of Manhattan).\\n\\n- An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.\\n\\n- Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region within the U.S. state of New York. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound. Across the Sound, to the northwest, lies Westchester County on mainland New York. To the west, Long Island is separated from the Bronx and the island of Manhattan by the East River. To the extreme southwest, it is separated from the New York City borough of Staten Island and the U.S. state of New Jersey by Upper New York Bay, the Narrows, and Lower New York Bay. To the east lie Block Island and numerous smaller islands.\\n\\n- Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\\n\\n- Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.\\n\\n- Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. \\n\\n- Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City. It is geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the southwestern end of Long Island, and to Nassau County further east on Long Island; in addition, Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (after Brooklyn), with a census-estimated 2,339,150 residents in 2015, approximately 48% of them foreign-born. Queens County also is the second-most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, behind the neighboring borough of Brooklyn, which is coterminous with Kings County. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States. If each of New York City's boroughs were an independent city, Queens also would be the nation's fourth most populous city, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.\\n\\n- \`\` While You Wait for the Others '' is a song by Brooklyn - based indie rock band Grizzly Bear , and the second single from the band 's third studio album , Veckatimest . The song was released as a single on August 31 , 2009 .\\n\\n- Manhattan is the most densely populated borough of New York City, its economic and administrative center, and the city's historical birthplace. The borough is coextensive with New York County, founded on November 1, 1683, as one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York. The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the East, Hudson, and Harlem rivers, and also includes several small adjacent islands and Marble Hill, a small neighborhood on the U.S. mainland.\\n\\n- Veckatimest is the third studio album by the American indie rock band Grizzly Bear, released on May 26, 2009, on Warp Records. The album is named after Veckatimest Island, a small island in Dukes County, Massachusetts. Produced by bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor, the album entered the US \\"Billboard\\" 200 at #8, selling 33,000 copies in its first week of release. By September 2012, the album had sold around 220,000 copies in the US.\\n\\n- Veckatimest Island is one of the Elizabeth Islands, part of the town of Gosnold in Dukes County, Massachusetts, United States. The island has a land area of 0.0675 km² (0.026 sq mi, or 16.675 acres) and was uninhabited as of the 2000 census. \\n\\n- Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'while you wait for the others' exhibits the relationship of 'record label'.

After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare.

Pharmacodynamic effects of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist eptifibatide have been delineated in healthy subjects but not in patients with ACS. We assessed effects of eptifibatide on ex vivo platelet aggregation in patients enrolled in the Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin (eptifibatide) Therapy (PURSUIT) trial of ACS.   \\n METHODS AND RESULTS Patients were randomly assigned to an intravenous bolus (180 microgram/kg) and 72-hour infusion of eptifibatide (2.0 microgram/kg per minute, n=48) or placebo (n=50). We assessed correlations of plasma eptifibatide levels with receptor occupancy and inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation at 5 minutes and 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours during treatment and 4 and 8 hours after termination of infusion. Blood was collected in buffered citrate and D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethylketone anticoagulants. Although eptifibatide produced profound, prolonged inhibition of platelet aggregation during therapy, aggregation appeared to recover partially by 4 hours after the bolus. The aggregation response was greater with thrombin receptor agonist peptide versus ADP stimulation; inhibition of platelet aggregation was greater in blood samples anticoagulated with citrate versus D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethylketone (PPACK). Plasma eptifibatide levels correlated significantly with receptor occupancy but not with inhibition of platelet aggregation.   \\n CONCLUSIONS A bolus and infusion of eptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation profoundly in patients with ACS and is followed by brief, partial recovery.

Biard and Gary Pittman discovered near-infrared (900 nm) light emission from a tunnel diode they had constructed on a GaAs substrate. By October 1961, they had demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling between a GaAs p-n junction light emitter and an electrically-isolated semiconductor photodetector. On August 8, 1962, Biard and Pittman filed a patent titled \\"Semiconductor Radiant Diode\\" based on their findings, which described a zinc diffused p–n junction LED with a spaced cathode contact to allow for efficient emission of infrared light under forward bias. After establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks predating submissions from G.E. Labs, RCA Research Labs, IBM Research Labs, Bell Labs, and Lincoln Lab at MIT, the U.S. patent office issued the two inventors the patent for the GaAs infrared (IR) light-emitting diode (U.S. Patent US3293513), the first practical LED. Immediately after filing the patent, Texas Instruments (TI) began a project to manufacture infrared diodes. In October 1962, TI announced the first LED commercial product (the SNX-100), which employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit a 890 nm light output.

Thousands of variants are known throughout the world. The title character is a young woman living in unfortunate circumstances, that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune. The oldest documented version comes from China, and the oldest European version from Italy. The most popular version was first published by Charles Perrault in \\"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\\" in 1697, and later by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection \\"Grimms' Fairy Tales\\".\\n\\n- William Wordsworth (7 April 1770  23 April 1850) was a major English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" (1798).\\n\\n- Emmeline , The Orphan of the Castle is the first novel written by English writer Charlotte Turner Smith ; it was published in 1788 . A Cinderella story in which the heroine stands outside the traditional economic structures of English society and ends up wealthy and happy , the novel is a fantasy . At the same time , it criticises the traditional marriage arrangements of the 18th century , which allowed women little choice and prioritised the needs of the family . Smith 's criticisms of marriage stemmed from her personal experience and several of the secondary characters are thinly veiled depictions of her family , a technique which both intrigued and repelled contemporary readers . Emmeline comments on the 18th - century novel tradition , presenting reinterpretations of scenes from famous earlier works , such as Samuel Richardson 's Clarissa ( 1747 -- 48 ) . Moreover , the novel extends and develops the tradition of Gothic fiction . In combination with this , Smith 's style marks her as an early Romantic . Her characters learn about their identities from nature and her landscape descriptions are imbued with political messages about gender relations . Smith had separated from her husband in 1787 and was forced to write to support herself and her children . She quickly began writing novels , which were profitable at the time . Emmeline was published a year later in 1788 ; the first edition sold out quickly . Smith 's novel was so successful that her publisher paid her more than he had initially promised . The novel was printed in the United States , translated into French , and issued several times during the 19th century .\\n\\n- A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists.\\n\\n- Charlotte Turner Smith (4 May 1749  28 October 1806) was an English Romantic poet and novelist. She initiated a revival of the English sonnet, helped establish the conventions of Gothic fiction, and wrote political novels of sensibility. A successful writer, she published ten novels, three books of poetry, four children's books, and other assorted works, over the course of her career. She saw herself as a poet first and foremost, poetry at that period being considered the most exalted form of literature at. Smith's poetry and prose were praised by contemporaries such as poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, as well as novelist Walter Scott. Scholars now credit her with transforming the sonnet into an expression of woeful sentiment. Coleridge, in 1796, remarked that those sonnets appear to me the most exquisite, in which moral Sentiments, Affections, or Feelings, are deduced from, and associated with the scenery of Nature. After 1798, however, Smith's popularity waned and by 1803 she was destitute and illshe could barely hold a pen, and sold her books to pay off her debts. In 1806, Smith died. Largely forgotten by the middle of the 19th century, her works have now been republished and she is recognized as an important Romantic writer.\\n\\n- Charles Perrault (12 January 1628  16 May 1703) was a French author and member of the Académie Française. He laid the foundations for a new literary genre, the fairy tale, with his works derived from pre-existing folk tales. The best known of his tales include \\"Le Petit Chaperon Rouge\\" (\\"Little Red Riding Hood\\"), \\"Cendrillon\\" (\\"Cinderella\\"), \\"Le Chat Botté\\" (\\"Puss in Boots\\"), \\"La Belle au bois Dormant \\" (\\"The Sleeping Beauty\\"), and \\"Barbe Bleue\\" (\\"Bluebeard\\"). Some of Perrault's versions of old stories have influenced the German versions published by the Brothers Grimm more than 100 years later. The stories continue to be printed and have been adapted to opera, ballet (such as Tchaikovsky's \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\"), theatre, and film. Perrault was an influential figure in the 17th-century French literary scene, and was the leader of the Modern faction during the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns.\\n\\n- Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\".\\n\\n- Samuel Taylor Coleridge (21 October 177225 July 1834) was an English poet, literary critic and philosopher who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets. He wrote the poems \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" and \\"Kubla Khan\\", as well as the major prose work \\"Biographia Literaria\\". His critical work, especially on Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including suspension of disbelief. He was a major influence on Emerson and American transcendentalism.\\n\\n- Sensibility refers to an acute perception of or responsiveness toward something, such as the emotions of another. This concept emerged in eighteenth-century Britain, and was closely associated with studies of sense perception as the means through which knowledge is gathered. It also became associated with sentimental moral philosophy.\\n\\n- The Brothers Grimm (' or '), Jacob (17851863) and Wilhelm Grimm (17861859), were German academics, philologists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together specialized in collecting and publishing folklore during the 19th century. They were among the best-known storytellers of folk tales, and popularized stories such as \\"Cinderella\\" (\\"\\"), \\"The Frog Prince\\" (\\"\\"), \\"The Goose-Girl\\" (\\"Die Gänsemagd\\"), \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" (\\"\\"), \\"Rapunzel\\", \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\" (\\"\\"),\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" (\\"\\"), and \\"Snow White\\" (\\"\\"). Their first collection of folk tales, \\"Children's and Household Tales\\" (\\"), was published in 1812.\\n\\n- A sonnet is a poem in a specific form which originated in Italy; Giacomo Da Lentini is credited with its invention.\\n\\n- Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, FRSE (15 August 1771  21 September 1832) was a Scottish historical novelist, playwright and poet with many contemporary readers in Europe, Australia, and North America.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'emmeline' exhibits the relationship of 'genre'.

This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: The study of rock strata is called stratigraphy. The laws of stratigraphy can help scientists understand Earths past. The laws of stratigraphy are usually credited to a geologist from Denmark named Nicolas Steno. He lived in the 1600s. The laws are illustrated in Figure 11.6. Refer to the figure as you read about the laws below. Superposition refers to the position of rock layers and their relative ages. Relative age means age in comparison with other rocks, either younger or older. The relative ages of rocks are important for understanding Earths history. New rock layers are always deposited on top of existing rock layers. Therefore, deeper layers must be older than layers closer to the surface. This is the law of superposition. You can see an example in Figure 11.7. Rock layers extend laterally, or out to the sides. They may cover very broad areas, especially if they formed at the bottom of ancient seas. Erosion may have worn away some of the rock, but layers on either side of eroded areas will still match up. Look at the Grand Canyon in Figure 11.8. Its a good example of lateral continuity. You can clearly see the same rock layers on opposite sides of the canyon. The matching rock layers were deposited at the same time, so they are the same age. Sediments were deposited in ancient seas in horizontal, or flat, layers. If sedimentary rock layers are tilted, they must have moved after they were deposited. Rock layers may have another rock cutting across them, like the igneous rock in Figure 11.9. Which rock is older? To determine this, we use the law of cross-cutting relationships. The cut rock layers are older than the rock that cuts across them. Geologists can learn a lot about Earths history by studying sedimentary rock layers. But in some places, theres a gap in time when no rock layers are present. A gap in the sequence of rock layers is called an unconformity. Look at the rock layers in Figure 11.10. They show a feature called Huttons unconformity. The unconformity was discovered by James Hutton in the 1700s. Hutton saw that the lower rock layers are very old. The upper layers are much younger. There are no layers in between the ancient and recent layers. Hutton thought that the intermediate rock layers eroded away before the more recent rock layers were deposited. Huttons discovery was a very important event in geology! Hutton determined that the rocks were deposited over time. Some were eroded away. Hutton knew that deposition and erosion are very slow. He realized that for both to occur would take an extremely long time. This made him realize that Earth must be much older than people thought. This was a really big discovery! It meant there was enough time for life to evolve gradually. When rock layers are in the same place, its easy to give them relative ages. But what if rock layers are far apart? What if they are on different continents? What evidence is used to match rock layers in different places? Some rock layers extend over a very wide area. They may be found on more than one continent or in more than one country. For example, the famous White Cliffs of Dover are on the coast of southeastern England. These distinctive rocks are matched by similar white cliffs in France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Denmark (see Figure 11.11). It is important that this chalk layer goes across the English Channel. The rock is so soft that the Channel Tunnel connecting England and France was carved into it! Like index fossils, key beds are used to match rock layers. A key bed is a thin layer of rock. The rock must be unique and widespread. For example, a key bed from around the time that the dinosaurs went extinct is very important. A thin layer of clay was deposited over much of Earths surface. The clay has large amount of the element iridium. Iridium is rare on Earth but common in asteroids. This unusual clay layer has been used to match rock up layers all over the world. It also led to the hypothesis that a giant asteroid struck Earth and caused the \\n Question: Many of the divisions of the geologic time scale mark major events in the history of","target":"life","rationale":"The word \\"life\\" is a word in the passage that can be used to answer the question."},{"source":"Classify the given comment into 'Hope Speech' or 'Not Hope Speech'.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday.

Stallman had a difficult relationship with his parents, as his father had a drinking habit and verbally abused his stepmother. He later came to describe his parents as \\"tyrants\\". He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the IBM 7094.\\n\\nStallman places great importance on the words and labels people use to talk about the world, including the relationship between software and freedom. He asks people to say free software and GNU/Linux, and to avoid the terms intellectual property and piracy (in relation to copyright). One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agree to use his terminology throughout the article. He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues.  Stallman argues that the term \\"intellectual property\\" is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar. He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues.  These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art. Patent law was intended to encourage publication of ideas, at the price of finite monopolies over these ideas - a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. Trademark law was not intended to promote any business activity, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying.  An example of cautioning others to avoid other terminology while also offering suggestions for possible alternatives is this sentence of an e-mail by Stallman to a public mailing list:  I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages).

One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept, or the \\"arms\\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. Other new features of religious architecture include the crossing tower and a monumental entrance to the church, usually at the west end of the building.Carolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court, and the monasteries and churches they supported. It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down.

Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures.\\n\\nComposers of the late 18th century became fascinated with the new possibilities of the symphony and other instrumental music, and generally neglected choral music. Mozart's choral works, though not as numerous as his works for other media, stand out as some of his greatest (such as the \\"Great\\" Mass in C minor and Requiem in D minor, the latter of which is often considered the greatest Requiem Mass of all time). Haydn became more interested in choral music near the end of his life following his visits to England in the 1790s, when he heard various Handel oratorios performed by large forces; he wrote a series of masses beginning in 1797 and his two great oratorios The Creation and The Seasons. Beethoven wrote only two masses, both intended for liturgical use, although his Missa solemnis is probably suitable only for the grandest ceremonies due to its length, difficulty and large-scale scoring. He also pioneered the use of chorus as part of symphonic texture with his Ninth Symphony and Choral Fantasia.  In the 19th century, sacred music escaped from the church and leaped onto the concert stage, with large sacred works unsuitable for church use, such as Berlioz's Te Deum and Requiem, and Brahms's Ein deutsches Requiem. Rossini's Stabat mater, Schubert's masses, and Verdi's Requiem also exploited the grandeur offered by instrumental accompaniment. Oratorios also continued to be written, clearly influenced by Handel's models. Berlioz's L'enfance du Christ and Mendelssohn's Elijah and St Paul are in the category. Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Brahms also wrote secular cantatas, the best known of which are Brahms's Schicksalslied and Nanie.  A few composers developed a cappella music, especially Bruckner, whose masses and motets startlingly juxtapose Renaissance counterpoint with chromatic harmony. Mendelssohn and Brahms also wrote significant a cappella motets. The amateur chorus (beginning chiefly as a social outlet) began to receive serious consideration as a compositional venue for the part-songs of Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms, and others. These 'singing clubs' were often for women or men separately, and the music was typically in four-part (hence the name \\"part-song\\") and either a cappella or with simple instrumentation.

Passage 1:German Namibians () are a community of people descended from ethnic German colonists who settled in present-day Namibia. In 1883, the German trader Adolf Lüderitz bought what would become the southern coast of Namibia from Josef Frederiks II, a chief of the local Oorlam people, and founded the city of Lüderitz. The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, proclaiming it German South West Africa (). Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials. In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost its colonial possessions, including South West Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former German colony was administered as a South African mandate. The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory alongside Afrikaans and English.\\n Passage 2:Earle L. Reynolds (October 18, 1910 – January 11, 1998) was an anthropologist, educator, author, Quaker, and peace activist. He was sent to Hiroshima by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1951 to study the effects of the first atomic bomb on the growth and development of exposed children. His professional discoveries concerning the dangers of radiation later moved Reynolds into a life of anti-nuclear activism. In 1958 he sailed with his wife Barbara, two of his three children and a Japanese yachtsman in the Phoenix of Hiroshima, a ketch he had designed himself, into the American nuclear testing zone in the Pacific. In 1961 the family sailed to the USSR to protest Soviet nuclear testing. During the Vietnam War Reynolds and his second wife Akie sailed the Phoenix to Haiphong to deliver humanitarian and medical aid to victims of American bombing.\\n Passage 3:The Anita Kerr Singers or The Jordanaires sang background on just about every Nashville hit in the late 1950s and early 1960s. After she and Al Kerr divorced, she disbanded the Nashville version of her Anita Kerr Singers and relocated to Los Angeles in August 1965 with her second husband, Swiss businessman Alex Grob, and her daughters Suzie & Kelly. She no longer wanted to just be a background singer or arranger on country songs – she wanted to do pop music, jazz and \\"do more orchestral writing and music that was not just country.\\". She hired some lawyers to get her out of her contract with RCA’s Nashville division, got a contract with Warner Bros. Records, and formed a Los Angeles version of the Anita Kerr Singers. The new group, for the next five years, would include the following personnel: alto B.J. Baker or Jackie Ward, tenor Gene Merlino or Bill Cole, baritone Bill Lee, bass Bob Tebow, and Kerr herself as soprano and arranger. The half dozen albums recorded by the Singers for Warner included a cover version of the song \\"All You Need Is Love\\" by The Beatles, and one of the LPs was exclusively devoted to the songs of composer Bert Kaempfert. Disguising the group as the Mexicali Singers, Kerr also recorded a trio of mariachi-flavored albums with musical arrangements reminiscent of the Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass sound.

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium.

Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship.

In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.\\n\\nQuestion: From what country do most domesticated  quails today descend from ?","target":"modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)","rationale":"The context states that \\"\\"modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)\\"\\".

We now show a relation to local flow variations in the adult human vasculature: decreased LKLF expression was noted at the aorta bifurcations to the iliac and carotid arteries, coinciding with neointima formation. The direct involvement of shear stress in the in vivo expression of LKLF was determined independently by in situ hybridization and laser microbeam microdissection/reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a murine carotid artery collar model, in which a 4- to 30-fold induction of LKLF occurred at the high-shear sites. Dissection of the biomechanics of LKLF regulation in vitro demonstrated that steady flow and pulsatile flow induced basal LKLF expression 15- and 36-fold at shear stresses greater than approximately 5 dyne/cm2, whereas cyclic stretch had no effect. Prolonged LKLF induction in the absence of flow changed the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelin-1, adrenomedullin, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase to levels similar to those observed under prolonged flow. LKLF repression by siRNA suppressed the flow response of endothelin-1, adrenomedullin, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P < 0.05).

Nitrogen(III) oxide, N2O3, is the anhydride of nitrous acid; HNO2 forms when N2O3 reacts with water. There are no stable oxyacids containing nitrogen with an oxidation state of 4+; therefore, nitrogen(IV) oxide, NO2, disproportionates in one of two ways when it reacts with water. In cold water, a mixture of HNO2 and HNO3 forms. At higher temperatures, HNO3 and NO will form. Nitrogen(V) oxide, N2O5, is the anhydride of nitric acid; HNO3 is produced when N2O5 reacts with water: N 2 O 5(s) + H 2 O(l) ⟶ 2HNO 3(aq) The nitrogen oxides exhibit extensive oxidation-reduction behavior. Nitrous oxide resembles oxygen in its behavior when heated with combustible substances. N2O is a strong oxidizing agent that decomposes when heated to form nitrogen and oxygen. Because one-third of the gas liberated is oxygen, nitrous oxide supports combustion better than air (one-fifth oxygen). A glowing splinter bursts into flame when thrust into a bottle of this gas. Nitric oxide acts both as an oxidizing agent and as a reducing agent. For example: oxidizing agent: P 4(s) + 6NO(g) ⟶ P 4 O 6(s) + 3N 2(g).\\n\\n\\nQ: What forms as a result of decomposition when n2o  is heated?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"nitrogen and oxygen","rationale":"Given:\\nN2O is a strong oxidizing agent that decomposes when heated to form nitrogen and oxygen."},{"source":"The task is to generate text based of an event.

Results: Class III penetrenes encoded by members of the Rhabdoviridae and Herpesviridae have an internal fusion domain comprised of beta sheets, other beta sheet domains, an extended alpha helical domain, a membrane proximal stem domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor. Similar sequences and structural/functional motifs that characterize class III penetrenes are located collinearly in GP64 of group I baculoviruses and related glycoproteins encoded by thogotoviruses. Structural models based on a prototypic class III penetrene, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G), were established for Thogoto virus (THOV) GP and Autographa california multiple NPV (AcMNPV) GP64 demonstrating feasible cysteine linkages. Glycosylation sites in THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 appear in similar model locations to the two glycosylation sites of VSV G.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]\\n\\nThe continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]","target":"bowl B","rationale":"Glace fruits are preserved in heated sugar syrup.

Charles received the French with 150,000 of his own men. In the ensuing Battle of Wagram, which also lasted two days, Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then. Neither side made much progress on 5 July, but the 6th produced a definitive outcome. Both sides launched major assaults on their flanks. Austrian attacks against the French left wing looked dangerous initially, but they were all beaten back. Meanwhile, a steady French attack against the Austrian left wing eventually compromised the entire position for Charles. Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat. Austrian losses were very heavy, reaching well over 40,000 casualties.

Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.","target":"drowning","rationale":"This paragraph goes over the legal system in Ancient Egypt, and how they carried out punishments.

In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985.

In 1992, the game was released for the PC Engine along with its sequel, , in the one-disc compilation Xak I & II. Ported by Riot, the game features animated cut scenes and requires the Super System Card update if played on the PC Engine's original CD-ROM add-on. Another console port was published by Sunsoft for the Super Famicom in February 1993. The latest visually enhanced remake was developed for Japanese mobile phones and became available on Vodafone live! on June 1, 2004. The game was the first release in Bandai's \\"RPG Empire\\" line of role-playing games.\\n Passage 2:Genaro Vazquez Nevarez, better known under the Ring name Blue Panther, made his professional wrestling debut on October 8, 1978. His first break came working for the Universal Wrestling Association in the early 1980s. In the UWA he won the UWA World Welterweight Championship, and the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship twice. He later moved on to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), the promotion he worked for, for most of his career. In CMLL he became involved in the storyline feud that would not only bring him to national and international attention but also helped cement his reputation as highly talented wrestler, a feud against \\"Love Machine\\" Art Barr, The feud spanned two promotions (CMLL and Asistencia Asesoría y Administración), included two high profile Lucha de Apuestas, or bet matches, where Blue Panther won the mask, and then the hair of Barr, as well as a long series of main event matches. In CMLL Blue Panther's won the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, the CMLL World Tag Team Championship with Atlantis, CMLL World Trios Championship twice, and the Mexican National Trios Championship twice. In 2007 he won the mask of Lizmark Jr., but lost his own mask the following year to Villano V. At his 35th Anniversary Show in 2013 Vazquez introduced two of his sons to the wrestling world, Blue Panther Jr. and Black Panther. For the 40th-anniversary show, Vazques was involved in booking two matches for the show, including creating the Copa Halcón Suriano in honor of his wrestling trainer.\\n Passage 3:The Glorious Revolution of 1689 involved the overthrow of King James II, who converted to Catholicism before he became king and favoured the Catholics, and his replacement by son-in-law William III, a Dutch Protestant. The Act of Settlement 1701, which was passed by the Parliament of England, stated the heir to the throne must not be a \\"Papist\\" and that an heir who is a Catholic or who marries one will be excluded from the succession to the throne. This law was extended to Scotland through the Act of Union which formed the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Act was amended in 2013 as regards marriage to a Catholic and the ecumenical movement has contributed to reducing sectarian tensions in the country.","target":"2","rationale":"The question is asking for the years that Blue Panther was a wrestler for CMLL, which can be found in passage 2."},{"source":"You are given a conversation between two people.'Person1:' and 'Person2:' are used to separate their respective dialogues.

After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, hit the top five in five other countries, and was a platinum-seller in the US. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984. It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track \\"Jump\\", which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks. Heart, after floundering during the first half of the decade, made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit. The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades. Among the first were ZZ Top, who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles, beginning with \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\" (1983), which helped their albums Eliminator (1983) and Afterburner (1985) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively. Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads, including REO Speedwagon with \\"Keep on Loving You\\" (1980) and \\"Can't Fight This Feeling\\" (1984), Journey with \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981) and \\"Open Arms\\" (1982), Foreigner's \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\", Scorpions' \\"Still Loving You\\" (both from 1984), Heart’s \\"What About Love\\" (1985) and \\"These Dreams\\" (1986), and Boston's \\"Amanda\\" (1986).","target":"1982","rationale":"Van Halen released their fifth album, Diver Down in 1982."},{"source":"Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type.

According to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world with human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the land bridge of Beringia that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was a glacial refugia because it had low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist.

He also spent one summer at Tanglewood in the Fellowship program (now Tanglewood Music Center), which at that time was managed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra where he worked with conductors Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland and Arthur Fiedler. While studying at Indiana University from 1972 to 1976 Aronoff studied under timpanist George Gaber. He also studied privately with Vic Firth and Arthur Press, both formerly with The Boston Symphony Orchestra. After graduating in 1976 he was offered jobs with the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Quito Ecuador Symphony Orchestra but decided to move to the East Coast to study in Boston with Alan Dawson, a teacher from Berklee College of Music, and with Gary Chester in New York where he began to concentrate on jazz and fusion music.\\n Passage 2:He began 2018 in Europe with third at the Czech Indoor Gala and a runner-up finish at the Cinque Mulini.

He was beaten by the heat, however, and finished fifth in the 5000 m. He made his IAAF Diamond League debut that year, placing seventh at Athletissima. He closed the year with third place at the Great Ethiopian Run. At the start of 2019 he continued to show his strength over distance with second place at the Giro Media Blenio 10K. Turning to the track, he won the Ethiopian national title, was fifth at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, then had his first Diamond League victory by winning the 5000 m at the Golden Gala, beating his partner Selemon Barega. He was third at that year's Athletissima and placed fourth at the Diamond League final at the Weltklasse Zürich.\\n Passage 3:In the biblical account, Joseph's other son is Manasseh, and Joseph himself is one of the two children of Rachel and Jacob, the other being Benjamin. Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe – that of Joseph. The Book of Revelation, however, accords only Ephraim the tribal name of Joseph. According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was originally part of the suggested Ephraim-Manasseh single \\"Joseph\\" tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost. A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the Joseph tribes (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout. According to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to Laban to obtain a wife originated as a metaphor for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt; according to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal matriarchs at all.","target":"3","rationale":"The correct answer is passage 3.

He became famous when he became the first person to produce lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)  . In addition, he was also the first person to taste it and learn about its hallucinogenic   effects. He was deeply connected to the nature and argued that LSD, besides being useful for psychiatry , could also be used to promote awareness of mankind's place in nature.

These experiences caused questions in his mind, and chemistry was the scientific field which allowed him to understand them.\\nHe studied chemistry at Zurich University, and his main interest is the chemistry of plants and animals. At 23, he earned his Ph. D with honors.\\nQuestion: Which can be inferred about Albert from the passage?\\nOptions: A: He has four brothers or sisters.\\nB: He has found many useful plants.\\nC: He lived up to more than 100 years.\\nD: He only concentrated on scientific experiments.","target":"C","rationale":"The question asks which of the given options can be inferred from the passage.\\nOption A: He has four brothers or sisters - This option cannot be inferred because it is not stated in the article, and therefore incorrect.\\nOption B: He has found many useful plants- While this was true as he worked with various plants at Sandoz Laboratories, his discovery of LSD and its effects are mentioned instead while describing him becoming famous so it's unlikely to have been emphasized here if that were what made him most famous.

First, she went to the museum; then she went to the zoo. She had a great time. The last sentence is missing in this story. Among options a, b, and c, option 'c' does not fit into this story at all and can be discarded from consideration. Option 'b' begins with \\"One day Callie took a trip to Cincinnati\\", which doesn't make sense given we have no indication that Callie has ever been there before or that we have even heard of her before; therefore option 'b' is also discarded from consideration. Finally, option 'a', which states \\"Finally she went to the Underground Railroad.\\", fits seamlessly into our existing passage as it provides more context for what happened after our protagonist finished having fun at both the museum and zoo - namely that they then went on an adventure by following clues in order to find their way out of an escape room based on escaping slavery via the Underground Railroad during America's history as well as gives us some insight into how much fun they were having along their journey (i.e., if they were \\\\\\"finally\\\\\\" able to get free).\\\\nTo complete our answer string such that it follows the format specified in instructions for this task ('4a, 1b'), we must determine where options 'a' would go within our existing passage if inserted somewhere amongst its current 3 sentences (1st sentence in original passage + 2 arbitrary remaining sentences). We can do so by finding any logical conflict between them such as might occur with one sentence immediately following another within our original 3-sentence passage resulting from insertion of either option 'a'. So let us see what would happen if we inserted option 'a' immediately after each sentence within our original 3-sentence passage:\\\\n\\\\n1.) If placed after first sentence: \\\\\\"First she went to the museum [Finally she went] ...\\\\\\" - All good! Not much conflict here except for perhaps chronological flow since it does seem like quite a long time has passed between visiting both museums AND zoos but let's not worry about that for now...\\\\n2.) If placed after second sentence: \\\\\\"Then she [went] ... To The Zoo\\\\\\" - No major conflict seen here either except perhaps again chronological flow but still no deal breakers...\\\\n3.) If placed after final/third original sentence: \\\\\\"[She had] A Great Time Finally She Went ...\\\\\\" - Definitely no chronology issues here besides possibly being repetitive/confusing regarding use of phrase Finally She Went again so soon BUT overall also very plausible location due largely because placement preserves general structure/flow while adding additional interesting context...\\\\nTherefore based off these observations alone when placing whichever choice(s) wherever possible throughout remaining portions of stories under review per task requirements (*), I believe 4th position makes most sense when inserting choice(s) somewhere amongst rest of current story/passage despite being slightly less than ideal compared against other two possibilities due primarily since doing so avoids repetition issues inherent when inserting chosen choice(s) anywhere else including beginning or end (and possibly middle although probably only slightly worse than ending depending on how you look at things). Additionally note however whatever leftovers remain available including whatever choices initially deemed unsuitable or otherwise rejected outright early during review process may come back up again later during further run throughs involving other stories especially those sharing similar characteristics such as titles & topic matter!

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\\n\\nIs NOBODY wrong in the post ? POST : I missed Monday, which is the day they announced a special schedule for the next two days (Yesterday, Today). I walked in an hour late to my first class of the day today since I didn't know better and thought the schedule was the usual, and my teacher deadpan said \\"You're an hour late.\\" I handed him my pass, and in passing, said \\"I didn't get an e-mail\\" because this is my first year here, and my old school did everything by email, including announcements where I'd know about these things. \\n\\nI was honestly not aware, and I simply said that I didn't know. I tried to be apologetic. He then proceeded to tell me to exit the class and talk to him outside. \\n\\nHe said he hated how I was retorting (I honestly just wanted to provide some explanation) and that he was upset that I was an hour late (I came on a late start day schedule, we effectively start an hour late) and some other stuff that I can't begin to remember. He was mad. I just stopped listening, at this point he was just ranting and raving, but I remember him saying for me to get back inside and try again. I just passed him silently, I'd already given him my tardy slip. \\n\\nIt was just me that was late that day. He claimed he showed the class the funky schedule for the week. I wasn't there that day (Monday) and when I conferred with other teachers, they said there wasn't even advisory (the time he claimed he showed the class). \\n\\nThe reason I'm unsure if I'm a lesser human being is because I passed by the Conduct Principal and said basically the same thing:\\n\\n\\"Hey, u/Small1324, you're late.\\"\\n\\n\\"Yeah, I didn't get an e-mail.\\"\\n\\n\\"I know you weren't here Monday. Have a nice day.\\"\\n\\nIf I hadn't tried this on someone else, and walked in and said that, sure, I'd be a jerk, I don't know why, but the first reaction I got saying that wasn't great so that ought to tell me not to do it again. But I said this in good faith, not with malicious intent, and the Conduct Principal, the one I've had most run-ins (mostly for being tardy 1-2 minutes every other morning) just said to have a nice day. \\n\\nI feel like this sudden anger was statistically unexpected.¹ There's no way I'd have predicted that kind or anger.²\\n\\nSo am I a garbage human being³ for not knowing the schedule and choosing to explain myself instead of shut up?\\n\\n----------------------\\n\\n1: As you can see, I like logic more than my dictionary. Sometimes I really want to shut up, forever, and watch instead of talk. I'm not good at words, and maybe word choice was the breaking point. \\n\\n2: This teacher is noted by many of my peers to be \\"kind of bad\\" and \\"not worth reasoning with\\". I've seen him with a short fuse and call someone out who was drawing in class while he was lecturing (I think you should only call someone out if they're distracting others. An individual's grade belongs to them). \\n\\n3: avoiding swear words because someone at the school might be watching my every move. There's a team of Sherrifs' deputies that literally just sit at their desks and watch internet content that comes out of us. Lots of strict internet rules I've encountered before, but I'm able to be expelled, and almost the age where I can be charged with crime.\\n\\nEpilogue: I've talked to two other teachers and a senior, both say I'm in the clear (I'm in a similar standing with them, I'm just \\"a\\" student, not a disrupter, not incredibly bright even though I'm apparently \\"gifted\\"). One of the teachers said some teachers might not be accepting of what appears to be a retort, although she also said that this doesn't sound like it. The other teacher was willing to go to that teacher and talk about it. \\n\\nThe senior student realised the core issue for me, I think. The issue was the way I said it. I said \\"I didn't\\" instead of \\"Sorry for not knowing\\". I mean, it's not like I didn't try to apologize, I guess it's just the wrong kind of words came out of my mouth. Not that I'd know, again, not the greatest with words. I'm glad he gave me some good advice as well, check the calendar when school intersects a holiday. \\n\\nI tried to get this tardy excused but the person at the desk essentially said I had to be more vigilant about checking the calendar. \\n\\nSo again, the question. Am I less human for deciding to say something?\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\n**TL;DR**: I gave an explanation as to why I'm an hour late, and my teacher pulled me out of class almost immediately and angrily ranted about me \\"retorting\\" when I walked in and said so. I'd have accepted my A status then, but I said this to the Conduct Principal as well while walking to that class and he just said to have a nice day, no anger. \\n\\nAgain, I'm not excusing myself. I'm explaining. I'm not trying to gain an air of self righteousness. I'm here to see if me saying something makes me less human. \\n\\n--------------------------\\n\\nHopefully you guys will have a better Thanksgiving than me.

The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income.

The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires.\\n\\nand the situation: Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A.

Although the theatre licensing laws of the day prevented full costumed performances, Cons presented condensed versions of well-known operas, always sung in English. Among the performers were noted singers such as Charles Santley. These operatic evenings quickly became more popular than the dramas that Cons had been staging separately. In 1898, she recruited her niece Lilian Baylis to help run the theatre. At the same time she appointed Charles Corri as the Old Vic's musical director. Baylis and Corri, despite many disagreements, shared a passionate belief in popularising opera, hitherto generally the preserve of the rich and fashionable. They worked on a tiny budget, with an amateur chorus and a professional orchestra of only 18 players, for whom Corri rescored the instrumental parts of the operas. By the early years of the 20th century, the Old Vic was able to present semi-staged versions of Wagner operas.Emma Cons died in 1912, leaving her estate, including the Old Vic, to Baylis, who dreamed of transforming the theatre into a \\"people's opera house\\". In the same year, Baylis obtained a licence to allow the Old Vic to stage full performances of operas. In the 1914–1915 season, Baylis staged 16 operas and 16 plays (13 of which were by Shakespeare). In the years after the First World War, Baylis's Shakespeare productions, which featured some of the leading actors from London's West End, attracted national attention, as her shoe-string opera productions did not.

We have found that human neutrophils resist complement lysis by the physical removal of membrane attack complexes by both endocytic and exocytic process. The latter mechanism predominates, vesiculation being detectable within 60 sec of initiating the complement cascade. Sixty-five percent of the formed complexes are removed on plasma membrane vesicles, although only 2% of the cell surface is lost. Ultrastructural examination revealed that these vesicles were covered with ring-like \\"classical\\" complement lesions. Analysis of these vesicles by gel electrophoresis indicated that C9 was present exclusively in the form of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant, high m.w. complex. In contrast, the 35% of C9 that remained associated with the cells was found to be inaccessible to a C9-specific monoclonal antibody, and was partly degraded, suggesting internalization of the membrane attack complex and proteolysis of some C9 molecules.

The relaxation effect was pronouncedly enhanced by H2S- and HS−-donor NaHS (30 μmol/l) at 7.5 pH but not at 6.3 pH. To study molecular mechanism of this effect, we investigated whether NaHS can release NO from NO donors. Using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy method of spin trap and by measuring the NO oxidation product, which is nitrite, by the Griess reaction, we report that NaHS released NO from nitrosothiols, namely from GSNO, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP), from metal nitrosyl complex nitroprusside (SNP) and from rat brain homogenate and murine L1210 leukaemia cells. From the observation that the releasing effect was more pronounced at 8.0 pH than 6.0 pH, we suppose that HS−, rather than H2S, is responsible for the NO-releasing effect. Since in mammals, H2S and HS− are produced endogenously, we assume that their effect to release NO from nitrosothiols and from metal nitrosyl complexes are responsible for some of their biological activities and that this mechanism may be involved in S-nitrosothiol-signalling reactions.","target":"H2S and HS− donor NaHS releases nitric oxide from nitrosothiols, metal nitrosyl complex, brain homogenate and murine L1210 leukaemia cells","rationale":"The abstract explains the effects of NaHS on nitrosoglutathione and describes experiments that demonstrate that it releases NO from a variety of sources.

At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China.

And third, self-talk allows us to control our cognitive and reactions, making us stay on tasks.\\nIn a recent study of students learning to throw darts  in a gym class, Athanasios Kolovelonis and his colleagues at the University of Thessaly in Greece found that self-talk is most effective when involved in a cycle of thought and action.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state.

He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen.

Recent reports showed that the level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine was altered in various types of cancers. The influence of deoxyribonucleic acid methylation in cervical squamous cell carcinoma is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and ten-eleven translocation expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and whether they are associated with poor survival in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.', 'We detected the expression of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine and TET1/2/3 in 140 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma and 40 patients with normal cervical tissues by immunohistochemistry. We assessed the prognostic values of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine and TET2 in the clinical outcome of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Expression of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine was significantly decreased in cervical squamous cell carcinoma compared with normal cervix tissues. In contrast, 5-methylcytosine expression was significantly increased in cervical squamous cell carcinoma compared with normal cervix tissues. Moreover, expression of TET2, but not TET1 and TET3, was decreased in cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Our study showed that the decreased level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine predicts poor prognosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients. The expression of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine was an independent prognostic factor for both disease-free and overall survival of cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients.\\nAnswer: In cervical squamous cell carcinoma, less aggressive tumor behavior was correlated with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and TET2. Our data indicated that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine may become a prognostic marker for cervical squamous cell carcinoma and the decreased expression of TET2 may be an underlying mechanism for decreased 5-hmC in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.","target":"Is 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine expression associated with poor survival in cervical squamous cell carcinoma?","rationale":"The given answer mentions about the decreased expression of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and how it may predict poor prognosis of patients.

Tectonic plates colliding does not have anything to do with creating holes in the earth's surface; dense rock formations under topsoil would actually prevent these holes from forming; buildup of sediment on ocean floors creates land instead, which makes them less prone to having areas where there are missing parts beneath their surfaces (as opposed to erosion).\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion, \\"the removal of underground resources\\" is the best"},{"source":"In this task, you are given a conversation between a flight agent and the customer.

POST : I've been seeing a guy for a few weeks now, we've been on a few dates but haven't done anything sexual except from making out.

We were texting and I pretty much said that I was fine with moving the relationship forward and he then told me that he is HIV-positive, but is on medication which means it can't be passed onto sexual partners.\\n\\nI know this is bad to say but all my sexual attraction to him disappeared in that very moment. I know that if I had sex with him, I would be worrying the whole time about HIV transmission. I also know it's illogical because it's not transmissable but I just wouldn't feel safe. I'm very very very careful with sexual activity because I know HIV is a bigger problem in the gay community than for straight people and it's something I really don't want in my life, even though I know people can live completely fulfilling lives and normal lifespans with it.\\n\\nI didn't have the courage to tell him that I didn't want to have sex with him because of his HIV status so I sort of wrapped up the conversation and then deliberately brought up politics (which I know is a big issue for a lot of people) a few days later and pretended to end things with him over that saying that \\"we just didn't see eye to eye\\". In reality I couldn't care less about his political beliefs, I just can't see myself being intimate with someone who has HIV.\\n\\nI told my sister about this and she said I was being judgemental and ruining what could be a great relationship. It's sad but I see her points in some ways. This guy was really respectful of my wishes to not have sex which can sometimes be rare to find in the gay community, he's really attractive and intelligent and very caring + kind. But I just can't seem to get past his HIV, and I wish I could but I can't. Also, on our first date he wanted to hook up and I'm 99% sure he wasn't even going to tell me he was HIV positive which makes me question if he's the person I thought he was.\\n\\nI know no one is obligated to have sex with anyone else, consent is important and I think rejection for any reason is fine, but I can't help feel like I have a stigma in my mind and I feel really guilty about even thinking like this… am I the asshole?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author describes a past event in which they became intimate with a partner and found out that he was HIV-positive.

Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed.

If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events.

Whether sympathetic overactivity develops early during pregnancy, remaining high throughout gestation, or whether it only occurs at term providing the substrate for hypertensive disorders is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that sympathetic activation occurs early during pregnancy in humans. Eleven healthy women (29 ± 3 (SD) years) without prior hypertensive pregnancies were tested during the mid-luteal phase (PRE) and early pregnancy (EARLY; 6.2 ± 1.2 weeks of gestation). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and haemodynamics were measured supine, at 30 deg and 60 deg upright tilt for 5 min each. Blood samples were drawn for catecholamines, direct renin, and aldosterone. MSNA was significantly greater during EARLY than PRE (supine: 25 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 8 bursts min(-1), 60 deg tilt: 49 ± 14 vs. 40 ± 10 bursts min(-1); main effect, P < 0.05). Resting diastolic pressure trended lower (P = 0.09), heart rate was similar, total peripheral resistance decreased (2172 ± 364 vs. 2543 ± 352 dyne s cm(-5); P < 0.05), sympathetic vascular transduction was blunted (0.10 ± 0.05 vs. 0.36 ± 0.47 units a.u.(-1) min(-1); P < 0.01), and both renin (supine: 27.9 ± 6.2 vs. 14.2 ± 8.7 pg ml(-1), P < 0.01) and aldosterone (supine: 16.7 ± 14.1 vs. 7.7 ± 6.8 ng ml(-1), P = 0.05) were higher during EARLY than PRE. These results suggest that sympathetic activation is a common characteristic of early pregnancy in humans despite reduced diastolic pressure and total peripheral resistance. These observations challenge conventional thinking about blood pressure regulation during pregnancy, showing marked sympathetic activation occurring within the first few weeks of conception, and may provide the substrate for pregnancy induced cardiovascular complications.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that outlines the objective of the study (\\"We tested the hypothesis that sympathetic activation occurs early during pregnancy in humans.\\"), relevant supporting sentences providing additional information about how data was collected and analyzed, and concluding statements summarizing when sympathetic overactivity develops.
