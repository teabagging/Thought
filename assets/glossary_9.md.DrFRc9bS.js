The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459).

A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.\\nIn late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors.

Charles now had a force of about 1,000 and on 19 August launched the rebellion by raising the Royal Standard at Glenfinnan. The Jacobites advanced towards Edinburgh, reaching Perth on 4 September where they were joined by more sympathisers, among them Lord George Murray. Murray was an experienced soldier pardoned by the government for his role in the 1715 and 1719 risings; he replaced O'Sullivan as commander due to his better understanding of Highland culture and spent the next week re-organising it. The senior government officer in Scotland, Lord President Duncan Forbes received confirmation of the landing on 9 August, which he forwarded to London. His military commander Sir John Cope had only 3,000 mostly untrained recruits and initially could do little to suppress the rebellion. Forbes instead relied on his personal relationships to keep people loyal and though unsuccessful with Lochiel, Murray and Lord Lovat, many others stayed on the sidelines as a result.\\n\\nWho served first as commander, Murray or O'Sullivan?","target":"O'Sullivan","rationale":"To solve the problem \\"Who served first as commander, Murray or O'Sullivan?\\", we need to compare when they started serving as commander.

Gospel music usually has dominant vocals (often with strong use of harmony) with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century, with roots in the black oral tradition. Hymns and sacred songs were repeated in a call and response fashion. Most of the churches relied on hand clapping and foot stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done a cappella. The first published use of the term \\"Gospel Song\\" probably appeared in 1874. The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H.

Wu Miao, the Prefect of Jiaozhi, sent him to the court of Sun Quan (the ruler of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms) in Nanjing, where Sun requested that he provide him with a report on his native country and its people. An expedition was mounted to return the merchant along with ten female and ten male \\"blackish coloured dwarfs\\" he had requested as a curiosity, as well as a Chinese officer, Liu Xian of Huiji (in Zhejiang), who died en route.

Passage 1:The Prisión Fatal concept was originally unveiled on December 2, 2012 during IWRG's first ever Prisión Fatal event. The match concept involved a 15 foot tall steel cage surrounding the wrestling ring. The competitors, so far always four, would each be attached by the wrist to a long chain where the other end is attached to the cage. The object of the match is to reach the key to the lock that is hung from the cage. Once a wrestler has the key he is able to unlock himself and climb out of the cage, thus escaping the match. The last man left in the ring would be forced to unmask and reveal his real name if he is masked, or have his hair shaved totally off if he is unmasked, as per the Luchas de Apuestas traditions. For the match Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. and Cien Caras, Jr. both risk their mask on the outcome while Pirata Morgan and Máscara Año 2000, Jr. risk their hair. Of the four wrestlers involved Máscara Año 2000, Jr. has only lost one Apuestas match, which forced him to unmask, while Pirata Morgan has lost a number of Apuestas matches and thus been shaved bald on multiple occasions in his 30-plus year career. Cien Caras, Jr. and Máscara Año 2000, Jr. had at this point been teaming together since 2007, forming Los Capos Junior along with Hijo de Máscara Año 2000, with no storyline signs of tension or friction between the two before the match was announced. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. had not worked for IWRG on a regular basis since 2006 and not worked for IWRG in the months leading up to the Prisión Fatal show, making his inclusion in the steel cage match a bit of a surprise. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. had been involved in a long running storyline feud with Los Capos, including Máscara Año 2000, Jr.'s father Máscara Año 2000, the storyline father of Cien Caras, Jr., Cien Caras and Universo 2000, but that storyline had up until the time of the show being announced only sporadically involved the second generation Capos, primarily when Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. teamed up with his son Rayman to take on the senior/junior Máscara Año 2000s. Pirata Morgan and his sons had been a regular worker for IWRG for several years and had at times wrestled Los Capos Junior, but this had never escalated into a long running storyline feud. The first real interaction between the factions in the main event of the Prisión Fatal show happened on March 10, 2013 during the main event of an IWRG event where Cien Caras, Jr. and Máscara Año 2000, Jr. teamed up with Hijo de Máscara Año 2000 to take on the team of Hijo de Pirata Morgan, Pirata Morgan and Electroshock. During the match Cien Caras, Jr. used an illegal low blow on Hijo de Pirata Morgan to win the first fall for his team, taking advantage of the fact that all six competitors were in the ring at the same time, distracting the referee. During the second fall Pirata Morgan tried to gain a measure of revenge for his son and pulled Cien Caras, Jr.'s mask off, but this illegal move was noticed by the referee who disqualified his team for the overall loss. Following the match all six wrestlers fought both inside and outside of the ring until they were separated by officials.\\n Passage 2:Kriaučiūnas was born into a well-off Lithuanian family in Suvalkija. He attended Marijampolė Gymnasium and Sejny Priest Seminary. As a good student, he obtained a stipend from the Archbishop of Mogilev to study at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. However, the stipend obligated him to work at the Archdiocese of Mogilev. Therefore, he declined the final ordination to priesthood and attended University of Warsaw for a year to get a teaching diploma. He then returned to Lithuania and became a teacher at the Marijampolė Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Lithuanian, German and Greek languages and encouraged his students, many of whom later became prominent figures in independent Lithuania, to be proud of their Lithuanian identity and heritage. He defied the Lithuanian press ban teaching his students Lithuanian in the Latin alphabet and not the government-imposed Cyrillic script. Kriaučiūnas actively supported Aušra and Varpas, the key Lithuanian-language periodicals. He was forced to resign from the gymnasium in 1887 and found employment with the Marijampolė Court. In 1889, he was assigned as justice of the peace to where he spent a decade. During his free time, he continued to study linguistics. While his contemporaries were impressed by his wealth of knowledge, he wrote very little. His home was frequently visited by various activists and scholars. He was particularly close with Vincas Kudirka. In 1899, he lost his government job and was forced to take up a private attorney practice in Marijampolė until he was able to regain his teaching position at the Marijampolė Gymnasium in 1906. He taught Latin and Lithuanian languages and law. During World War I, the gymnasium evacuated to Yaroslavl where he died in January 1916.\\n Passage 3:In 1954, Ashton was spotted playing rugby union during his national service in the Royal Artillery and was subsequently invited for a trial with Wigan. He attended the trial and was seen by the directors of the club as being a player with exceptional talent, after Wigan offered him a spot in their top level side he offered his home town club St. Helens the chance to sign him but they passed and he then signed for Wigan in 1955 for £150. He made his first representative later that year, appearing for Lancashire against New Zealand. He represented Rest of the World in the 11-20 defeat by Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 29 June 1957, and represented Great Britain & France in the 37-31 victory over New Zealand at Carlaw Park, Auckland on 3 July 1957. After signing for Wigan he quickly linked up with Welsh Billy Boston, and formed one of the most devastating right-hand side threequarters partnerships of modern times. Ashton played right-, i.e. number 3, in the 8-13 defeat by Oldham in the 1956–57 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1957–58 season at Station Road, Swinton on Saturday 19 October 1957. He played and was captain in the 13–9 victory over Workington Town in the 1957–58 Challenge Cup Final during the 1957–58 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 10 May 1958, in front of a crowd of 66,109, such was the impact of both Ashton and Boston it led to Ashton being promoted as captain of the Wigan side after just two years at the club at the age of 22. It was a position he would go on to hold for the next twelve years. He made his international début at the age of 22 for the Great Britain side against France in 1957. He would go on to collect a total of 26 caps for the Great Britain side with his first Southern Hemisphere tour coming in 1957 as the British side competed in the World Cup. He was a true professional in every sense, being sent off just twice in his whole career and due to his professionalism, talent and intelligence he would go on to achieve a long and distinguished footballing career. Ashton's honours and achievements are nothing short of impressive, with 3 victorious Wembley Stadium Challenge Cup finals (out of a possible six), a Championship in 1960, a Lancashire Challenge Cup and two Lancashire League Championships as well as a BBC Floodlit trophy. He played , and was captain in Wigan's 30-13 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1958–59 Challenge Cup Final during the 1958–59 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 9 May 1959, in front of a crowd of 79,811.","target":"2","rationale":"The answer to the question is found in passage 2."},{"source":"I first experienced a loss of sexual desire several years ago, just after I turned 40.

In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a $100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a $250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.

This study was undertaken to dissect the relationship between CXCL13 expression levels in the synovium and clinico-pathological variables relevant to RA pathogenesis and outcome.', 'Synovial tissues from 71 RA patients were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Thirty paired samples were used for comparative gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR. CXCL13 levels were analysed in relation to cellular, molecular and clinical features of inflammation, lymphocyte activation and joint damage.', 'In patients with early disease (<12 months duration), CXCL13 expression correlated significantly with synovial markers of local disease activity and systemic inflammation. Such correlation was less evident in established RA. Notably, the association with lymphocyte infiltration and with expression of B/T cell-related activation and proliferation genes, such as activation-induced cytidine deaminase, IFN-γ and IL-2, remained highly significant independent of disease duration and local disease activity. Patients featuring the highest levels of CXCL13 were more frequently ACPA positive and IgG ACPA titres were increased in the high CXCL13 expression group. Furthermore, the frequency of erosive disease on radiographs was significantly higher in the upper tertile of CXCL13 expression (P = 0.01 with adjustment for disease duration and ACPA). Accordingly, synovial CXCL13 and the local receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio significantly co-varied (ρ = 0.52, P < 0.01), independent of the level of local inflammation.","target":"1","rationale":"The passage presents results from a study designed to explore the relationship between synovial CXCL13 expression and various inflammatory and clinical variables in RA.

Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent coup by the SA under Röhm – the so-called Röhm putsch.\\nThe primary instruments of Hitler's action, who carried out most of the killings, were the Schutzstaffel (SS) paramilitary force under Himmler and its Security Service (SD) under Reinhard Heydrich, and the Gestapo, the secret police, under Göring. Göring's personal police battalion also took part in the killings. Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA, the best-known being Röhm himself, the SA's chief of staff and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the leftist-leaning Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party, including its figurehead, Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had suppressed Hitler's Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.

[3-3H]- and [U-14C]glucose were infused before, during, and after treadmill running. During exercise the increase in glucose production (Ra) was always directly related to work intensity and faster than the increase in glucose disappearance, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. At identical work-loads the increase in Ra and plasma glucose as well as liver glycogen breakdown were higher in FF and control (C) rats than in FR rats. Breakdown of muscle glycogen was less in FF than in C rats. Incorporation of [14C]glucose in glycogen at rest and mobilization of label during exercise partly explained that 14C estimates of carbohydrate metabolism disagreed with chemical measurements. In some muscles glycogen depletion was not accompanied by loss of 14C and 3H, indicating futile cycling of glucose. In FR rats a postexercise increase in liver glycogen was seen with 14C/3H similar to that of plasma glucose, indicating direct synthesis from glucose. In conclusion, in exercising rats the increase in glucose production is subjected to feedforward regulation and depends on the liver glycogen concentration. Endogenous glucose may be incorporated in glycogen in working muscle and may be used directly for liver glycogen synthesis rather than after conversion to trioses. Fructose ingestion may diminish muscular glycogen breakdown. The [14C]glucose infusion technique for determination of muscular glycogenolysis is of doubtful value in rats. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical values, such as fructose gavage (approximately 10 g/kg), 4.52 mmol/l and 42% of pre-exercise values for plasma glucose levels in the FF rats during exercise, etc. So the answer is “Yes”."},{"source":"You are given a request sent by a user in a human and computer dialogue.

Subsequently, the French strategy of occupying small, poorly defended outposts throughout Indochina, particularly along the Vietnamese-Chinese border, started failing. Thanks to the terrain, popular support for August Revolution and support for decolonization from bordering China and the U.S.S.R., the Viet Minh had succeeded in turning a \\"clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army\\", following asymmetric warfare theory laid by Mao Tse Tung, something which previously had never been encountered by the western colonial powers. In October 1952, fighting around the Red River Delta spread into the Thai Highlands, resulting in the Battle of Nà Sản, at which the Viet Minh were defeated. The French used the lessons learned at Nà Sản – strong ground bases, versatile air support, and a model based on the British Burma Campaign – as the basis for their new strategy.

Oral Cavity The oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated in Figure 34.9. The food consumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food. The extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary glands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major glands that secrete saliva—the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria.

Some of his compositions were published and performed; the previous year The Times had praised his song \\"Light Leaves Whisper\\", \\"a moderately elaborate composition in six parts, treated with a good deal of expression and poetic feeling\\".Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst found that \\"man cannot live by composition alone\\"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\", conducted by Stanislas Wurm.Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for \\"the Worm\\" or any other light orchestra \\"a wicked and loathsome waste of time\\". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted that some of the music was \\"trashy\\" but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: \\"To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience.\\"With a modest income secured, Holst was able to marry Isobel; the ceremony was at Fulham Register..., can you guess it ?","target":"Vaughan Williams","rationale":"The full name of the person who claims that \\"the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure\\" is Vaughan Williams."},{"source":"Question: How many people are employed in the Texas Medical Center?\\nAnswer: More heart surgeries are performed at the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world.\\n A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The answer given appears to be a fact about the Texas Medical Center, but it does not address how many people are employed there."},{"source":"In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation and you have to find its answer.

This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5 billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2 AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, as a result of the vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600 K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700 current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.As the Sun expands, it will swallow the planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; although the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) will cause the planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up as a result of tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.Gradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11 times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770 K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100 million years.

Set in the Kingdom of Denmark, the play dramatises the revenge Prince Hamlet is called to wreak upon his uncle, Claudius, by the ghost of Hamlet's father, King Hamlet. Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the throne, also marrying his deceased brother's widow. \\"Hamlet\\" is Shakespeare's longest play, and is ranked among the most powerful and influential tragedies in English literature, with a story capable of \\"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\\". The play likely was one of Shakespeare's most popular works during his lifetime, and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879. It has inspired many other writers  from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch  and has been described as \\"the world's most filmed story after \\"Cinderella\\"\\".\\nThe story of Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his \\"Gesta Danorum\\", as subsequently retold by 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier (hypothetical) Elizabethan play known today as the \\"Ur-Hamlet\\", though some scholars believe he himself wrote the \\"Ur-Hamlet\\", later revising it to create the version of \\"Hamlet\\" we now have. He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time. In the 400 years since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century.\\n\\n- The Grey Fox is a 1982 Canadian biographical Western film directed by Phillip Borsos and written by John Hunter.

The film was edited and produced by Mary Sweeney, Lynch's longtime partner and co-worker. She co-wrote the script with John E. Roach. The film is based on the true story of Alvin Straight's 1994 journey across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawn mower. Alvin (Richard Farnsworth) is an elderly World War II veteran who lives with his daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), a kind woman with a mental disability. When he hears that his estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke, Alvin makes up his mind to go visit him and hopefully make amends before he dies. Because Alvin's legs and eyes are too impaired for him to receive a driving license, he hitches a trailer to his recently purchased thirty-year-old John Deere 110 Lawn Tractor, having a maximum speed of about 5 miles per hour, and sets off on the 240 mile journey from Laurens, Iowa to Mount Zion, Wisconsin.\\n\\n- The Pulitzer Prize for Drama is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music.

It recognizes a theatrical work staged in the U.S. during the preceding calendar year.\\n\\n- Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells.\\nFactors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\\nProstate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention.

Called to testify before the U.S. Congressional House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he denied communist affiliation and refused to \\"name names\\", effectively ending his film career. Some have alleged that the stress of this incident led to his premature death at 39 from a heart attack. Garfield is acknowledged as a predecessor of such Method actors as Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and James Dean.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'resurrection ' with the relationship of 'genre'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- abstract\\n - action\\n - action film\\n - art\\n - child\\n - comedy film\\n - drama\\n - drama film\\n - dramatic\\n - essays\\n - family\\n - fiction\\n - fiction film\\n - flight\\n - james\\n - magazine\\n - march\\n - mass\\n - musical\\n - mythology\\n - play\\n - poet\\n - science\\n - science fiction film\\n - screenplay\\n - television\\n - television series\\n - theater\\n - tragedy\\n - variety\\n - video\\n - western\\n - will","target":"drama film","rationale":"\\"Resurrection\\", a 1980 film directed by Daniel Petrie is classified as a drama.

During this time, Goryeo was controlled by a military regime led by the Choe family. In 1232 the government under the nominal king fled to Ganghwa Island, which Mongol horse riders were unable to land on, and resisted the Mongol invasion. Unfortunately because of its fragile foundation, Goryeo faced frequent rebellions. The 1258 rebellion resulted in the establishment of Ssangseong  and Dongnyeong Prefectures  by the Mongols. Unlike these rebels, the Sambyeolcho  were an organ of the military government. They were organized by the Choe family to maintain security. However, unlike the Choe private guards unit , the Sambyeolcho assumed public functions performed by police and combat forces, effectively replacing the Six Divisions of the military. In 1258, Choe Ui, the fourth of the Choe family, was overthrown by Kim Jun  using the Sambyeolcho. Kim Jun took a pro-Mongol policy and sent Crown Prince Wang Jeon to the Mongol Empire. At the same time, King Gojong and the crown prince approached the Mongols to restore power from Kim Jun. In 1268, however, Kim Jun was annihilated by the Sambyeolcho under the order of Im Yeon. The next year, Im Yeon's attempt to replace King Wonjong was reversed by the crown prince  with the help from the Mongol force. In 1270, Im Yeon's successor Im Yumu was killed by the pro-Mongol faction using the Sambyeolcho. It marked the end of the military regime.\\n\\nHow many Mongol prefectures were established due to the rebellion in 1258?","target":"2","rationale":"In order to answer the question \\"How many Mongol prefectures were established due to the rebellion in 1258?\\", we need to check how many of them were actually mentioned.

Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.\\nTo create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.\\nFollowing the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company.

They have observed that approximately from 18 months, their behavior is different from that of other children of their age. Until then, they had attributed their limited interaction to the fact that they were becoming more independent, and the lack of language development, to which they were not yet enrolled. In the consultation you observe that the girl does not respond when she calls her by her name, shows little eye contact, performs vocalizations without communicative intention, and does not look at where the parents point her. Given these findings, all of the following statements are true, EXCEPT one: \\n Options:  <1> Parents should be reassured, recommended schooling as soon as possible, and arrange a follow-up in 3 months. <2> The most likely diagnosis is autistic spectrum disorder. <3> A diagnostic evaluation must be carried out by a team with experience in autism. <4> Appropriate early intervention is recommended. <5> The origin of the disorder is multifactorial.","target":"1","rationale":"The question describes the parents of a 2-year-old girl who are concerned about her development. They have observed that she does not interact with them and has limited language skills. The examiner observes similar behaviors in the consultation, including lack of eye contact, vocalizations without communicative intention, and failure to respond to pointing. The examiner needs to assess the girl for symptoms of autistic spectrum disorder based on this description of her behavior. Therefore option (2) is true and can be eliminated as an incorrect answer choice.\\n\\nAutistic spectrum disorder typically presents itself before 3 years old with symptoms such as impaired social interaction, impaired communication skills, restricted interests or stereotyped behaviors, and abnormal sensory responses (APA DSM 5 Task Force). Therefore option (3) is also true and can be eliminated as a possible incorrect answer choice because it recommends diagnostic evaluation by a team with experience in autism which is appropriate given these findings. \\nOption (4) is also true because early intervention is recommended for children with autistic spectrum disorder which may improve their outcome (Schieve et al., 2008). \\nOption (5) is false because there has been significant research into identifying possible genetic causes for autistic spectrum disorders but most agree that there are multiple factors involved in causing autism including genetics and environmental factors such as infection during pregnancy or birth complications (Tuchman & Rapin 2002; Zerbo et al., 2015). Based on these criteria options 1 through 4 are ruled out leaving only option 5 left which appears to be correct according to our criteria above so we would select option 5 as the correct response.\\"\\""},{"source":"You will be given a passage consisting of set of facts and a question as input.

In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.\\n\\nParagraph: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which P.D. took a less efficient approach in fighting crime?","target":"Greenville","rationale":"Greenville P.D did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology which are important areas of crime fighting.

John spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. John's judicial reforms had a lasting impact on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute finally settled by the king in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines. When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and the barons agreed to the Magna Carta peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis of France. It soon descended into a stalemate.

This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.","target":"Ural","rationale":"Joint blocks are large pieces of rock that become loose and then trapped in valley glaciers.

He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives.\\nThe Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

This work represents some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in \\"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\\", has been seen as a step towards the modern novel. Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes, or at least intimately connected with it, and between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, perhaps as herald-at-arms (as Gaston Paris speculated).\\n\\n- Linda Hutcheon, FRS, O.C.

She is University Professor in the Department of English and of the Centre for Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto, where she has taught since 1988. In 2000 she was elected the 117th President of the Modern Language Association, the third Canadian to hold this position, and the first Canadian woman. She is particularly known for her influential theories of postmodernism.\\n\\n- William the Clerk ( French : Guillaume le Clerc ) ( fl . c. 1200 -- c. 1240 ) was an Old French poet known only from the self - attribution at the end of the Arthurian Roman de Fergus , a parody of the romances of Chrétien de Troyes , notably the Conte du Graal . William may have been a Scoto - Norman , but the two manuscripts that preserve the Roman are from northeastern France , perhaps suggesting their provenance there . It was once suggested to have been commissioned by Alan of Galloway for his wedding in 1209 , since Alan was the descendant of Fergus , who ruled Galloway as king in the mid-twelfth century . Beate Schmolke - Hasselmann rejected this view and proposed that the Roman was commissioned by Dervorguilla , heiress of Galloway , and her husband , John I de Baliol , to promote the claim of their son , Hugh , to the Scottish throne , a claim derived from their ancestor Fergus Mor mac Eirc . This dates the work later than their marriage , which took place around 1223 , and prior to John 's death in 1268 , most likely between 1237 and 1241 . D. D. R. Owen , adjudging the author to be intimately familiar with major figures and events of the reign of William the Lion in Scotland , posited as \`\` a strong possibility '' that William the Clerk is William Malveisin , a Frenchman who arrived in Scotland in the 1180s and served as a royal clerk . In this scenario , the Roman was composed after 1200 . Finally , William may be the William de Bois ( de Bosco , de Bosch ) who was a clerk of the royal chapel in 1193 and chancellor from 1210 to 1226 .\\n\\n- Marie of France (1145  March 11, 1198) was a French princess and Countess consort of Champagne.

The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.\\n\\n- The French Renaissance was the cultural and artistic movement in France between the 15th and early 17th centuries. The period is associated with the pan-European Renaissance, a word first used by the French historian Jules Michelet to define the artistic and cultural \\"rebirth\\" of Europe.\\n\\n- Eleanor of Aquitaine (; 1122   1 April 1204) was a member of the Ramnulfids (\\"House of Poitiers\\") of rulers in southwestern France, and one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in western Europe during the High Middle Ages. She inherited the Duchy of Aquitaine from her father, William X, in 1137, and by successive marriages became queen of France (11371152) and then of England (11541189).

She led armies several times in her life, and was a leader of the Second Crusade.\\n\\n- A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\\n\\n- Bruno Paulin Gaston Paris (9 August 1839  5 March 1903) was a French writer and scholar.

The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians. The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the \\"Annales Cambriae\\", the \\"Historia Brittonum\\", and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as \\"Y Gododdin\\".\\n\\n- Yvain, the Knight of the Lion is an Arthurian romance by French poet Chrétien de Troyes. It was probably written in the 1170s simultaneously with \\"Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart\\", and includes several references to the narrative of that poem.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017.

Polemics are mostly seen in arguments about controversial topics. The practice of such argumentation is called \\"polemics\\". A person who often writes polemics, or who speaks polemically, is called a \\"polemicist\\". The word is derived , .\\n\\n- Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies.\\n\\n- Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.\\n\\n- Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age  until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom.\\n\\n- Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\\n\\n- Medieval literature is a broad subject, encompassing essentially all written works available in Europe and beyond during the Middle Ages (that is, the one thousand years from the fall of the Western Roman Empire ca. AD 500 to the beginning of the Florentine Renaissance in the late 15th century). The literature of this time was composed of religious writings as well as secular works. Just as in modern literature, it is a complex and rich field of study, from the utterly sacred to the exuberantly profane, touching all points in-between. Works of literature are often grouped by place of origin, language, and genre.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'william the clerk' with the relationship of 'occupation'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- academic\\n - author\\n - book\\n - clerk\\n - commercial\\n - computer\\n - critic\\n - farmer\\n - general\\n - historian\\n - intellectual\\n - king\\n - knight\\n - leader\\n - literary\\n - literary theorist\\n - major\\n - member\\n - poet\\n - president\\n - princess\\n - religious\\n - rhetoric\\n - swordsman\\n - trouvère\\n - writer","target":"writer","rationale":"The information mentions that William the Clerk is a writer."},{"source":"Angler fish hunt by using\\n\\nChoose an answer from this list:\\n- fishermen\\n- spear guns\\n- illumination\\n- fishing poles","target":"illumination","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"illumination\\"."},{"source":"Read the following article and answer the question.\\nArticle: In the late 1500s, a large powerful gun was placed on top of the Signal Hill, in prefix = st1 /Newfoundland, to prevent attacks from the outside.

It's fitting, then, the Italian Gulielmo Marconi should have chosen this site   to receive the world's first radio signal -- in Morse code -- from England on December 12, 1901. \\n    Marconi, combining earlier ideas with his own, led us to a new communications age. For the next 50 years, until the appearance of television, radio ruled the air waves.\\n    Today, it's the TV that rules. No single person can say to have invented television.\\n    In 1884, the German Paul Nipkow invented a device   that sent pictures mechanically  , and in 1906, Boris Rosing, a Russian, used a ray and a disc to create the world's first TV system. Then in the early 1920s, another Russian, Vladimir Zworykin,invented a picture display tube. He took out a patent   for color1 TV, even though it wouldn't be developed for another 25 years. \\n    In 1924, a Scot entered the scene -- John Logie Baird. He first succeeded in sending a moving picture and a year later got the first actual TV picture. In 1926, Baird showed TV in aLondonlaboratory. Two years later inNew York, Felix the Cat became the first TV star.\\nTV excited everyone's imagination, but hardly anyone had a set, with just two thousand in use worldwide in the mid-1930s. \\nSince the late 1940s, TV technology has developed very quickly. Computers may finally be combined with all televisions to give people a total all-in-one communications network. \\nToday, it's possible to sit and watch TV in the middle of a forest or in the Arctic.

Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to \\"make it easier on\\" herself, but she heard \\"that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted.\\" In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was \\"a natural\\" and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, \\"they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Her role was well received by Glen Oliver by IGN who liked that she did not portray her character \\"as a victimized female\\" but instead \\"as a strong female who does not come across as an over-the-top Women's Right Advocate.\\"\\nIn addition to acting, Aaliyah served as an executive producer of the film's soundtrack, where she contributed four songs. \\"Try Again\\" was released as a single from the soundtrack; the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, making Aaliyah the first artist to top the chart based solely on airplay; this led the song to be released in a 12\\" vinyl and 7\\" single.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of.\\nWhile in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community.\\nIn my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum.\\n\\nWhile at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA NAACP chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary. In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple hitch hiked to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her. The couple lived in Greenwich Village for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1962 and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an identity crisis until later that decade. She received her Master of Fine Arts from UCLA in 1964.  While in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was abstract, yet easily recognized as male and female sexual organs. These early works were called Bigamy, and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract penis, which was \\"stopped in flight\\" before it could unite with a vaginal form. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works. Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.  In 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show. In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the \\"California Women in the Arts\\" exhibition at the Lytton Center, to which she answered, \\"I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels.\\" Chicago began working in ice sculpture, which represented \\"a metaphor for the preciousness of life,\\" another reference towards her husband's death.  In 1969, the Pasadena Art Museum exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an \\"experimental\\" gallery. Art in America noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the conceptual art movement, and the Los Angeles Times described the work as showing no signs of \\"theoretical New York type art.\\" Chicago would describe her early artwork as minimalist and as her trying to be \\"one of the boys\\". Chicago would also experiment with performance art, using fireworks and pyrotechnics to create \\"atmospheres\\", which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to \\"feminize\\" and \\"soften\\" the landscape.  During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the Pasadena Lifesavers, which was a series of abstract paintings that placed acrylic paint on Plexiglas. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes \\"turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,\\" representing her own discovery that \\"I was multi-orgasmic.\\" Chicago credited Pasadena Lifesavers, as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Judy Chicago","rationale":"\\"Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen, July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist,\\"\\nThe given information clearly states the name of Judy Chicago and explains that she was a famous American Feminist artist."},{"source":"Premise: A young little girl in a dress stands and admires a creek.\\n\\nHypothesis: The young little girl is at home in her bed.\\n\\n.Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The premise states that the little girl is standing and admiring a creek.

She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apples?","target":"plums","rationale":"Plums have a much higher sugar content than apples. Sugar is what makes plums taste sweet and since Ann decided to candy half of her fruits, the answer must be \\"plum\\". The correct choice for this question would be 'Plum'."},{"source":"Which entity is this text about?\\n\\nLarry Wayne Gatlin (born May 2, 1948) is an American country and Southern gospel singer and songwriter. As part of a trio with his younger brothers Steve and Rudy, he achieved considerable success within the country music genre, performing on thirty-three Top 40 singles (combining his solo recordings and those with his brothers). As their fame grew, the band became known as Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers. Larry Gatlin is known for his rich falsetto singing style and for the unique pop-inflected songs he wrote and recorded in the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\nGatlin was born in Seminole in Gaines County, Texas, next to the New Mexico border. His father was an oilfield worker, and the family lived in several locations while he was a youth, including Abilene and Odessa. He was reared listening to country and southern gospel music. He and his brothers, Steve and Rudy, have performed together since childhood; when they were younger, they often sang in their local church. They sometimes performed on local radio stations, and occasionally on television shows. They also recorded a gospel music album for the Gospel label Sword and Shield. The brothers even managed to beat out the legendary Roy Orbison in a local talent contest. In 1964, Gatlin was a quarterback at Odessa High School.  After graduation in 1966, Gatlin was eligible to serve in the Vietnam War; however, he did not, instead choosing to attend the University of Houston. As a wide receiver on the football team, he caught a touchdown pass in a 1968 game in which his team, the Cougars, scored 100 points.  He later auditioned for and joined the gospel music group The Imperials. The Imperials went on to perform in Las Vegas, Nevada in January 1971 at Jimmy Dean's Las Vegas Revue. While walking through the showroom, he caught country singer Dottie West's attention, who thought he looked like Mickey Newbury.  West soon met Gatlin and was impressed with his songwriting skills. She was so impressed, in fact, that she recorded two of Gatlin's compositions, \\"You're the Other Half of Me\\" and \\"Once You Were Mine.\\" West also passed one of Gatlin's demo tapes around Nashville, Tennessee, and even arranged for him to relocate there, purchasing a plane ticket for him--a story he related on the 11/12/2009 episode of \\"Larry's Country Diner\\" on RFD-TV.

In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.\\n\\n- The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.\\n\\n- The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel.

Its source is Frankfield Loch in Cardowan to the north - east of Glasgow ; then it flows through Hogganfield Loch and into the Clyde . It was covered over in the 1870s ( by what is now Wishart Street ) . The point where it flowed into the Clyde caused silting , which allowed a ford to be made at the Saltmarket . This was later dredged and bridges were constructed . Small parts of the burn are uncovered in the Molendinar Park and beside the old Great Eastern Hotel on Duke Street , .\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.\\n\\n- The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples.

After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\".\\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist.

After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.

One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices.

The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996.

The state, law, and increasingly education used French, yet more than half the Belgian population were speaking a Dutch dialect. In the course of the nineteenth century the Flemish movement stood up for the rights of Dutch, mostly called Flemish. But in competing with the French language the variation in dialects was a serious disadvantage. Since standardisation is a lengthy process, Dutch-speaking Belgium associated itself with the standard language that had already developed in the Netherlands over the centuries. Therefore, the situation in Belgium is essentially no different from that in the Netherlands, although there are recognisable differences in pronunciation, comparable to the pronunciation differences between standard British and standard American English. In 1980 the Netherlands and Belgium concluded the Language Union Treaty.

A new study concludes that all types of nuts seem to be protective.\\nResearcher Ying Bao is with the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She and her colleagues looked at the impact of nut consumption by analyzing two huge studies that began in 1980 - the Nurses' Health Study, which tracks the\\nof more than 76,000 women, and 42,000 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.\\nAmong the questions asked at the beginning of the studies was, 'how frequently do you eat nuts?'

In one case, a moderately differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma involved an ovary and the pelvic wall. Treatment consisted of curettage and progestogens in three patients, one of whom later bore two children. The remainder of the women were treated with abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and/or radiation therapy.

As is the case with most dinosaurs, the skeleton of Parasaurolophus is incompletely known. The length of the type specimen of P. walkeri is estimated at 9.5 meters (31 ft). What environment did a parasaurolophus live in? Parasaurolophus lived along the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway. The area was a floodplain with rivers and swamps, and had distinct wet and dry seasons. Conifers …were the primary trees, but other plants like ferns, ginkgoes, cycads, and flowering plants also lived there. Brachiosaurus was an unusual dinosaur that lived 155.7 million to 150.8 million years ago during the mid- to late Jurassic Period. Specimens have been found primarily in the fossil-rich Morrison Formation in North America, but the dinosaur did not resemble any of the others that roamed the region. Its long neck made it look like a giraffe, and its forelegs were longer than its hind legs. The name Brachiosaurus, in fact, means arm lizard.. When did dinosaurs live? Dinosaurs lived between about 247 and 66 million years ago, in a time known as the Mesozoic Era. This was many millions of years before the first modern humans, Homo sapiens, appeared. Scientists divide the Mesozoic Era into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. What period did the parasaurolophus live? Parasaurolophus lived from about 76.5 to 73 million years ago. This was near the end of the Cretaceous period, the last period in the Mesozoic era. Parasaurolophus Facts. 1  Check out our Parasaurolophus facts for kids.

Rauschenbusch was a key figure in the Social Gospel and 'Single Tax' movements that flourished in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was also the maternal grandfather of the influential philosopher Richard Rorty and the great-grandfather of Paul Raushenbush.\\n\\n- The Social Gospel was a Protestant movement that was most prominent in the early-20th-century United States and Canada. The movement applied Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues of social justice such as economic inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, unclean environment, child labor, inadequate labor unions, poor schools, and the danger of war. Theologically, the Social Gospellers sought to operationalize the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:10): \\"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\\" They typically were post-millennialist; that is, they believed the Second Coming could not happen until humankind rid itself of social evils by human effort.

Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the Progressive Movement, and most were theologically liberal, although a few were also conservative when it came to their views on social issues.

Ely, Josiah Strong, Washington Gladden, and Walter Rauschenbusch.\\n\\n- Josiah Strong ( April 14 , 1847 -- June 26 , 1916 ) was an American Protestant clergyman , organizer , editor and author . He was a leader of the Social Gospel movement , calling for social justice and combating social evils . He supported missionary work so that all races could be improved and uplifted and thereby brought to Christ . He is controversial , however , due to his beliefs about race and methods of converting people to Christianity . In his 1885 book Our Country , Strong argued that Anglo Saxons are a superior race who must \`\` Christianize and civilize '' the \`\` savage '' races , which he argued would be good for the American economy and the \`\` lesser races '' .\\n\\n- Richard Theodore Ely (April 13, 1854  October 4, 1943) was an American economist, author, and leader of the Progressive movement who called for more government intervention in order to reform what they perceived as the injustices of capitalism, especially regarding factory conditions, compulsory education, child labor, and labor unions. Ely is best remembered as a founder and the first Secretary of the American Economic Association, as a founder and secretary of the Christian Social Union, and as the author of a series of widely read books on the organized labor movement, socialism, and other social questions.\\n\\n- Washington Gladden (February 11, 1836  July 2, 1918) was a leading American Congregational pastor and early leader in the Social Gospel movement. He was a leading member of the Progressive Movement, serving for two years as a member of the Columbus, Ohio city council and campaigning against Boss Tweed as religious editor of the \\"New York Independent\\". Gladden was probably the first leading U.S. religious figure to support unionization of the workforce; he also opposed racial segregation. He was a prolific writer who wrote hundreds of poems, hymns, articles, editorials, and books.\\n\\n- Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.\\n\\n\\n\\n'josiah strong' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- canada\\n - economist\\n - editor\\n - founder\\n - justice\\n - leader\\n - missionary\\n - pastor\\n - philosopher\\n - religious\\n - theologian","target":"pastor","rationale":"Josiah Strong was an American Protestant clergyman, organizer, editor and author.

But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

I find myself in a pretty shitty situation and I'm not entirely sure if I am being an asshole or not. Here's the situation I find myself in.\\n\\nFirst a little backstory...\\n\\nI met my ex-boyfriend at my then thirteen year old sister's summer soccer league tournament (she turned fourteen in November). He was a few months from turning eighteen and was becoming a high school senior. I was just starting high school toward the end of August and had just turned fifteen a couple of weeks before. His game ended an hour before I met him and my sister's team took the field. He came over and introduced himself. He said about his sister playing on the same team as my sister and we struck up a friendship right there while watching our younger siblings play. We ended up seeing each other on a regular basis after that. We started the school year in August and we really didn't see bunches of each other besides at lunch when we'd sit at a table together but we'd get together after our respective practices (his being soccer and me for cheerleading and softball on the weekend).\\n\\nWe kept this up for the next four months where we'd do stuff together and be boyfriend/girlfriend. Eventually I'd lose my virginity to him thinking he was such a great guy. Granted we would fight...but it was nothing too serious and any issues we did have would be resolved pretty quickly.\\n\\nThat would change around Christmastime...\\n\\nA few days before Christmas break, we were sitting in the cafeteria eating lunch when he said to me about having to go to another city in our state to visit family for Christmas. I told him that it was fine and that we were having family over from out of state and out of the country (Japan) for Christmas. We agreed to do our gift exchange on Friday night and I'd sleepover at his place. We did the exchange Saturday morning before they left to head north. I got him the game Pro Evolution Soccer for his PS4 because he had said about wanting to play that since he's played so much FIFA and he wanted to try PES. He got me a couple of cheaper necklaces and a bunch of cheaper bracelets and anklets (some of which I wear on a pretty regular basis) which I thought was so cute. I left his place about an hour and a half before they were supposed to leave. We texted when he got to where he was going later in the day and we texted and talked on other social media clear up to Christmas evening. The 26th we didn't get to talk because we were busy with other family and I was busy talking with my cousins that I never met before from Japan. The girls and I were up until 3 in the morning talking and drinking 7up and sparkling grape juice in the spa. The morning of the 27th, I didn't wake up until 10 in the morning which is late for me. My texts had blown up asking me if I had seen what was going on, on facebook, twitter, instagram and snapchat. I didn't know what they were talking about. So I looked at my socials...and my now ex broke up with me over social media. Not only did he break up with me...he blocked me on all the social medias I had him friended on. I texted him and he told me that he didn't want to hook up with me anymore and wanted to hook up with a new sophomore cheerleader on the varsity squad. I was devestated. I cried and was sad for several days. I finally started feeling better around New Year's Eve and even went for a shopping spree with my cousins and sisters and I even got dreadlocks! January 2nd rolled around and we had to go back to school. I was glad to see my friends from school and just wanted to get back into the swing of school. My ex tried to talk to me several times but I kept ignoring him on the advice of some of my closest friends and my eldest sister. Finally, Friday, he decided to confront me asking me what my fucking problem was and why I was being such a bitch and not talking to him. I told him that I didn't want to be associated with someone who only decides to break up with someone over the internet instead of doing it face-to-face. He called me a bitch and an asshole. I continued to not talk to him for the rest of the day.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not talking to him after how he broke up with me?","target":"answerable","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning if it was appropriate to not talk to their ex-boyfriend after he broke up with them over social media.\\\\nIn the post, the author mentions that they had broken up with their significant other several months prior and blocked them on all forms of social media.

Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired (\\"secondary\\") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection, extremes of age, and environmental factors, such as nutrition. In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can be either an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone.

Since yz=20y^2/z^2 (because x/y=2/z), this means that \\n5x^2/z³=(20y⁴)/(4*(u⁴)) since \\\\((\\\\frac{a}{b})^{-n}\\\\) is equal to \\\\(\\\\frac{a^{-n}}{b^{-n}}\\\\), so it follows that \\n5x⁲/(u³*4)=(20yu)/((u⁴)*4), so it follows that \\n5xy/(u³*4)=(20yu)/((u⁵)*16).

The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial.  He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire.

Knopf. It is believed that the decision to sell was prompted by Alfred A. Knopf, Jr., leaving Knopf to found his own book company, Atheneum Books in 1959. Since its founding, Knopf has paid close attention to design and typography, employing notable designers and typographers including William Addison Dwiggins, Harry Ford, Steven Heller, Chip Kidd, Lorraine Louie, Bruce Rogers, Rudolf Ruzicka, and Beatrice Warde. Knopf books conclude with an unnumbered page titled \\"A Note on the Type\\", which describes the history of the typeface used for the book. In addition, Knopf books date the year of the book's current printing on the title page. Knopf published textbooks until 1988, when Random House's schools and colleges division was sold to McGraw-Hill. In 1991, Knopf revived the \\"Everyman's Library\\" series, originally published in England in the early 20th century. This series consists of classics of world literature in affordable hardcover editions. The series has grown over the years to include lines of Children's Classics and Pocket Poets. Random House was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Knopf Publishing Group merged with Doubleday to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Random House has been owned since its 2013 merger of Penguin Group by Penguin Random House, a joint venture between Bertelsmann  and Pearson PLC . Many of Knopf's hardcover books are published later as Vintage paperbacks. Vintage Books is a sister imprint of Random House.

The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.\\nAfter the story the writer probably:\\n\\nA. dedicated new gallery subjects\\n\\nB. relaxeed by the ocean\\n\\nC. not enough information\\n\\nD. had a long career at the Villa","target":"D","rationale":"The writer is probably referencing their own career at the Villa, which started in 2012.

In 1661 Louis XIV, who was particularly hostile to the Huguenots, started assuming control of his government and began to disregard some of the provisions of the Edict. In 1681 he instituted the policy of dragonnades, to intimidate Huguenot families to convert to Roman Catholicism or emigrate. Finally, in October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which formally revoked the Edict and made the practice of Protestantism illegal in France. The revocation of the Edict had very damaging results for France. While it did not prompt renewed religious warfare, many Protestants chose to leave France rather than convert, with most moving to Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic and Switzerland. At the dawn of the 18th century, Protestants remained in significant numbers in the remote Cévennes region of the Massif Central. This population, known as the Camisards, revolted against the government in 1702, leading to fighting that continued intermittently until 1715, after which the Camisards were largely left in peace.\\n\\nQuestion about the article:","target":"How many years after he instituted the policy of dragonnades did Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau?","rationale":"Here's a question for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: How many years after he instituted the policy of dragonnades did Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau?"},{"source":"I have a new situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Does Bothar or Norlon have less wildlife?","target":"Norlon","rationale":"The background information tells us that carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas produced by humans and other animals through respiration or the burning of fossil fuels, is one of the leading contributors to global warming.

An increase in atmospheric CO2 could thus lead to higher temperatures and therefore more severe climate change for Norlon than for Bothar. Given how much damage global warming is doing here on Earth, it makes sense that this would affect wildlife populations as well (as stated in the background).

And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which period would see higher global temperature, time A or time B?","target":"time B","rationale":"The background information about the Greenhouse Effect explains how an increase in greenhouse gases can cause a higher global temperature.

Plenty of people break this law but I got into a car crash a few months ago and have been trying to play it safe. 2) when I say “our usual” I mean that she has both picked up panera for me before AND we get the same thing as each other.

Beckett, who now possesses Davy Jones's heart, orders Jones to destroy all pirate ships. Condemned prisoners defiantly sing a song to summon the nine pirate lords comprising the (fourth) Brethren Court to convene at Shipwreck Cove and take action against Beckett. However, Captain Jack Sparrow, pirate lord of the Caribbean, never appointed his successor, and therefore must attend. Captain Barbossa leads Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma and Black Pearl crewmen to rescue Jack. Sao Feng, pirate lord of the South China Sea and residing in Singapore, possesses a map to World's End, the gateway to Davy Jones' Locker, where Jack is eternally imprisoned. Elizabeth and Barbossa bargain with Feng for the map and a ship, but Feng is furious that Will already attempted to steal it. The British Royal Navy, led by Mercer, acting under orders from Beckett, make a surprise attack on Feng's bathhouse. During the ensuing chaos, Will strikes a bargain with Feng for the Black Pearl in exchange for Sparrow, who Feng wants to turn over to Beckett, presumably for immunity from Davy Jones' attacks on pirates. Will wants the Black Pearl to rescue his father from The Flying Dutchman.The crew journey through a frozen sea and sail over an enormous waterfall into the Locker. Sparrow, trapped aboard the Pearl, constantly hallucinates about an entire crew comprising himself, each representing a different facet of his character.

Passage:The longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards, a record set by Matt Prater on December 8, 2013. The previous record was 63, originally set by Tom Dempsey (1970) and then matched by Jason Elam (1998), Sebastian Janikowski (2011), David Akers (2012), Graham Gano (2018), and Brett Maher (2019). The record in the CFL is 62 yards, set by Paul McCallum on October 27, 2001. High school, college and most professional football leagues offer only a three-point field goal; however, some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through four-point field goals. NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three (much like Australian rules' Super Goal or basketball's three-point line), a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League. Similarly, the sport of arena football sought (unsuccessfully) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points; it failed, since only one kicker (Brian Mitchell) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency. (In six-man football, where there is no offensive line, all field goals are worth four points instead of the usual three.)","target":"b","rationale":"The question only asks for the number of years Prater played professional football and does not require the information regarding the NFL field goal record.

Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength.\\n\\nThis leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country—depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime.\\n\\nThis fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also, their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire any form of foreign facilities, e.g. medical facilities.\\n\\nParagraph: Nirvania continued to develop and became a first world country by 2025.

We represent protein structures by pairwise distances between all backbone atoms, and present a method for directly recovering and refining the corresponding backbone coordinates in a differentiable manner. We show that interpolations in the latent space of the generator correspond to smooth deformations of the output backbones, and that test set structures not seen by the generator during training exist in its image. Finally, we perform sequence design, relaxation, and ab initio folding of a subset of generated structures, and show that in some cases we can recover the generated folds after forward-folding.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives.\\nThe goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs.\\nOctober 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance.

He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales. He built custom-made instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947). Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave.\\n\\nSupported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947. This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music. Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press. He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments.  In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch to a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation, and did recordings, primarily of his Eleven Intrusions (1949-1950). He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch's recordings. In spring 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of King Oedipus at Mills College, with the support of designer Arch Lauterer. Performances of King Oedipus in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats's translation.  In February 1953, Partch founded the studio Gate 5 in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances. Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income. Partch's three Plectra and Percussion Dances, Ring Around the Moon (1949-1950), Castor and Pollux, and Even Wild Horses, premiered on Berkeley's KPFA radio in November 1953.  After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it. Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch's heir. In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, The Bewitched was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais's interpretation. Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot's film Windsong, the first of six film collaborations between the two. From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of Revelation in the Courthouse Park in 1961 and Water! Water! in 1962. Though these two works were based, as King Oedipus had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music. Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Harry Partch","rationale":"As the context is about Harry Partch, an American composer and music theorist.

Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles.\\nIt is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.\\nTeasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates.

He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the \\"Father of the Texas Blues\\". Jefferson's performances were distinctive because of his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists.\\n\\nLargely because of the popularity of artists such as Jefferson and his contemporaries Blind Blake and Ma Rainey, Paramount became the leading recording company for the blues in the 1920s. Jefferson's earnings reputedly enabled him to buy a car and employ chauffeurs (this information has been disputed); he was given a Ford car \\"worth over $700\\" by Mayo Williams, Paramount's connection with the black community. This was a common compensation for recording rights in that market. Jefferson is known to have done an unusual amount of traveling for the time in the American South, which is reflected in the difficulty of placing his music in a single regional category.  Jefferson's \\"old-fashioned\\" sound and confident musicianship made it easy to market him. His skillful guitar playing and impressive vocal range opened the door for a new generation of male solo blues performers, such as Furry Lewis, Charlie Patton, and Barbecue Bob. He stuck to no musical conventions, varying his riffs and rhythm and singing complex and expressive lyrics in a manner exceptional at the time for a \\"simple country blues singer.\\" According to the North Carolina musician Walter Davis, Jefferson played on the streets in Johnson City, Tennessee, during the early 1920s, at which time Davis and the entertainer Clarence Greene learned the art of blues guitar.  Jefferson was reputedly unhappy with his royalties (although Williams said that Jefferson had a bank account containing as much as $1500). In 1927, when Williams moved to Okeh Records, he took Jefferson with him, and Okeh quickly recorded and released Jefferson's \\"Matchbox Blues\\", backed with \\"Black Snake Moan\\". It was his only Okeh recording, probably because of contractual obligations with Paramount. Jefferson's two songs released on Okeh have considerably better sound quality than his Paramount records at the time. When he returned to Paramount a few months later, \\"Matchbox Blues\\" had already become such a hit that Paramount re-recorded and released two new versions, with the producer Arthur Laibly. In 1927, Jefferson recorded another of his classic songs, the haunting \\"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\\" (again using the pseudonym Deacon L. J. Bates), and two other uncharacteristically spiritual songs, \\"He Arose from the Dead\\" and \\"Where Shall I Be\\". \\"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\\" was so successful that it was re-recorded and re-released in 1928.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"How did that move go?","rationale":"The context given is an article on the American blues singer and guitarist Lemon Henry \\"Blind Lemon\\" Jefferson.

Eleven plays later, the Patriots faced 3rd-and-goal from the Jets' 2-yard line, but a run for a loss by running back Laurence Maroney set up a 21-yard Gostkowski field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. After a Jets punt, the Patriots extended their lead to 6-0 on a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal early in the second quarter. The Jets responded with a 77-yard drive, highlighted by a 54-yard Laveranues Coles completion from quarterback Brett Favre, which brought them as close to the end zone as the Patriots' 1-yard line, but they again had to settle for a field goal; this time Feely completed the 21-yard attempt to cut the Patriots' lead to 6-3. The Patriots and Jets exchanged punts to end the first half. After a Patriots punt began the second half, the Jets started their next possession from their own 23-yard line. Three offensive penalties later, with the Jets at 2nd-and-25, defensive back Brandon Meriweather earned his first career interception on an errant Favre pass, giving the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 31-yard line. Despite a Kris Jenkins sack of Cassel to begin the drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 22-yard completion to running back Kevin Faulk on a 3rd-and-9 play. Three plays later, Morris ran it in from the Jets' 1-yard-line for a touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 13-3. On an ensuing Jets punt, a 24-yard Faulk return set up the Patriots' next drive at the Jets' 39-yard line; nine plays later, a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 16-3 lead and ended the third-quarter scoring. Beginning from their own 20-yard line for the sixth time in the game, the Jets drove into the Patriots' red zone and then cut the Patriots' lead to 16-10 on a 2-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. The Patriots' next drive went for 71 yards and ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal to build the Patriots' lead to 19-10. This would be the final score, as the Jets' next drive, which included a 20-yard sack of Favre by Adalius Thomas, went three-and-out and the Patriots held the ball for the final 3:45 in the game.

Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin.

Here, we demonstrated that efficient expression of S from the wild-type spike gene in cultured cells required the use of improved plasmid vectors containing donor and acceptor splice sites, as well as heterologous viral RNA export elements, such as the CTE of Mazon-Pfizer monkey virus or the PRE of Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WPRE). The presence of both splice sites and WPRE markedly improved the immunogenicity of S-based DNA vaccines against SARS. Upon immunization of mice with low doses (2 μg) of naked DNA, only intron and WPRE-containing vectors could induce neutralizing anti-S antibodies and provide protection against challenge with SARS-CoV. Our observations are likely to be useful for the construction of plasmid and viral vectors designed for optimal expression of intronless genes derived from cytoplasmic RNA viruses. \\n Title: Heterologous viral RNA export elements improve expression of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike protein and protective efficacy of DNA vaccines against SARS","target":"False","rationale":"The title provides a general description of the study and its main findings, but it does not provide any information about the methods used to optimize spike protein expression or the results of the vaccine administration.

The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.\\nAlthough the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\".

The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.","target":"air power","rationale":"The context explains how the advent of aircraft as focal weapons drove naval combat to become significant.

In addition, clashes between aircraft carrier fleets during World War II led to Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor using carriers that had been concentrated into one unit.

In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant  , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges  went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away. We were able to call a friend and get a ride, leaving our broken car behind, but not before the couple gave us food and water for our journey. One week later, this dear sweet couple pulled our car all the way to our place and refused to take anything in return, except for us to pay it forward-and we have, and will continue to do it forever.\\nQuestion: Knowing that the wagon had broken down, the author  _  .\\n- called her friend several miles away for help\\n- stopped the car in front of a simple service station\\n- was afraid that they couldn't overcome the difficulty\\n- encouraged her husband and children to be confident","target":"was afraid that they couldn't overcome the difficulty","rationale":"The article mentions that the car started losing power, and the gauges were going out of order.

Consisting primarily of basaltic andesite, it has a more mafic composition than the other two volcanoes.

He was the subject of the verse invective In Rufinum by the western court poet Claudian .\\n\\n- Aelia Flavia Flaccilla (31 March 356  386), was a Roman empress and first wife of the Roman Emperor Theodosius I. She was of Hispanian Roman descent. During her marriage to Theodosius, she gave birth to two sons  future Emperors Arcadius and Honorius  and a daughter, Aelia Pulcheria. She was titled \\"Augusta\\", as her coinage shows.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- Magnus Maximus (ca. 335  August 28, 388) was Western Roman Emperor from 383 to 388.\\n\\n- Flavius Eugenius (died 6 September 394) was a usurper in the Western Roman Empire (392394) against Emperor Theodosius I. Though himself a Christian, he was the last Emperor to support Roman polytheism.\\n\\n- Aelia Eudoxia (died 6 October 404) was the Empress consort of the Byzantine Emperor Arcadius.\\n\\n- Theodosius I (11 January 347  17 January 395), also known as Theodosius the Great, was Roman Emperor from AD 379 to AD 395. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire. On accepting his elevation, he campaigned against Goths and other barbarians who had invaded the empire. He failed to kill, expel, or entirely subjugate them, and after the Gothic War, they established a homeland south of the Danube, in Illyricum, within the empire's borders. He fought two destructive civil wars, in which he defeated the usurpers Magnus Maximus and Eugenius at great cost to the power of the empire.\\n\\n- Arcadius (1 January 377  1 May 408) was Eastern Roman Emperor from 383 to 408. He was the eldest son of Theodosius I and his first wife Aelia Flaccilla, and brother of the Western Emperor Honorius. A weak ruler, his reign was dominated by a series of powerful ministers and by his wife, Aelia Eudoxia.\\n\\n- The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'rufinus ' and '335'?","target":"date of birth","rationale":"The answer is date of birth.

As a conductor, he championed the music of lesser-known composers. An Academy Award-winner (for The Devil and Daniel Webster, 1941; later renamed All That Money Can Buy), Herrmann is particularly known for his collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock, most famously Psycho, North by Northwest, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and Vertigo. He also composed scores for many other movies, including Citizen Kane, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Cape Fear, and Taxi Driver.\\n\\nHerrmann's music is typified by frequent use of ostinati (short repeating patterns), novel orchestration and, in his film scores, an ability to portray character traits not altogether obvious from other elements of the film.  Early in his life, Herrmann committed himself to a creed of personal integrity at the price of unpopularity: the quintessential artist. His philosophy is summarized by a favorite Tolstoy quote: 'Eagles fly alone and sparrows fly in flocks.' Thus, Herrmann would only compose music for films when he was allowed the artistic liberty to compose what he wished without the director getting in the way: the cause of the split with Hitchcock after over a decade of composing scores for the director's films.  His philosophy of orchestrating film was based on the assumption that the musicians were selected and hired for the recording session -- that this music was not constrained to the musical forces of the concert hall. For example, his use of nine harps in Beneath the 12 Mile Reef created an extraordinary underwater-like sonic landscape; his use of four alto flutes in Citizen Kane contributed to the creepy opening, only matched by the use of 12 flutes in his unused Torn Curtain score; and his use of the serpent in White Witch Doctor is possibly the first use of that instrument in a film score.  Herrmann said: \\"To orchestrate is like a thumbprint. I can't understand having someone else do it. It would be like someone putting color to your paintings.\\"  Herrmann subscribed to the belief that the best film music should be able to stand on its own legs when detached from the film for which it was originally written. To this end, he made several well-known recordings for Decca of arrangements of his own film music as well as music of other prominent composers.\\n\\nwhat was Hermann's philisophy?","target":"His philosophy of orchestrating film was based on the assumption that the musicians were selected and hired for the recording session","rationale":"The context mentions \\"his philosophy of orchestrating film\\".

AD 46  AD 120) was a Greek biographer and essayist, known primarily for his \\"Parallel Lives\\" and \\"Moralia\\".\\nHe is classified as a Middle Platonist. Plutarch's surviving works were written in Greek, but intended for both Greek and Roman readers.\\n\\n- Androgeos or Androgeus (Ancient Greek: ) was the name of two individuals in Classical mythology.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Daedalus (\\"Daidalos\\", perhaps related to  \\"to work artfully\\" Etruscan: \\"Taitale\\") was a skillful craftsman and artist. He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx, although this is unclear.\\n\\n- A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Pandion I was a legendary King of Athens, the son and heir to Erichthonius of Athens and his wife, the naiad Praxithea. Through his father he was the grandson of the god Hephaestus. He married a naiad, Zeuxippe, and they had two sons Erechtheus and Butes, and two daughters Procne and Philomela.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Nisos was the King of Megara, and one of the four sons of Pandion II, King of Athens. \\n\\n- Cecrops II was the legendary or semi-legendary son of Pandion I and inherited the Athenian throne from his brother Erechtheus.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Pandion II was a legendary King of Athens, the son and heir of Cecrops II and his wife Metiadusa, and the father of Aegeus, Pallas, Nisos and Lycus.\\n\\n- A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists.\\n\\n- Theseus was the mythical king of Athens and was the son of Aethra by two fathers: Aegeus and Poseidon.\\n\\n- Cecrops (\\"Kékrops\\"; \\"gen\\".: ) was a mythical king of Athens who, according to Eusebius reigned for fifty years. The name is not of Greek origin according to Strabo, or it might mean 'face with a tail': it is said that, born from the earth itself, he had his top half shaped like a man and the bottom half in serpent or fish-tail form. He was the founder and the first king of Athens itself, though preceded in the region by the earth-born king Actaeus of Attica. Cecrops was a culture hero, teaching the Athenians marriage, reading and writing, and ceremonial burial.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology , Pallas ( Ancient Greek :  ) was one of the four sons of Pandion II and Pylia . Upon the death of Pandion , Pallas and his brothers ( Aegeas , Nisos , and Lykos ) took control of Athens from Metion , who had seized the throne from Pandion . They divided the government in four but Aegeas became king . Pallas received Paralia or Diacria as his domain , or else he shared the power over several demes with Aegeus . Later , after the death of Aegeas , Pallas tried to take the throne from the rightful heir , his nephew , Theseus , but failed and was killed by him , and so were his fifty children , the Pallantides . In a version endorsed by Servius , Pallas was not a brother , but a son of Aegeus , and thus a brother of Theseus , by whom he was expelled from Attica . He then came to Arcadia , where he became king and founded a dynasty to which Evander and another Pallas belonged .\\n\\n- Erechtheus in Greek mythology was the name of an archaic king of Athens, the founder of the \\"polis\\" and, in his role as god, attached to Poseidon, as \\"Poseidon Erechtheus\\". The mythic Erechtheus and an historical Erechtheus were fused into one character in Euripides' lost tragedy \\"Erechtheus\\" (423/22 BCE). The name Erichthonius is carried by a son of Erechtheus, but Plutarch conflated the two names in the myth of the begetting of Erechtheus.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Metion (\\"gen\\". ) was a son of King Erechtheus of Athens or of Eupalamus, son of King Erechtheus. His sons later drove King Pandion II out of Athens into exile. Among these sons were Eupalamus, Sicyon, and Daedalus, though they are sometime credited with other parentages. These usurping sons were in turn overthrown by the sons of Pandion.\\n\\n- Jean Racine, baptismal name Jean-Baptiste Racine (22 December 163921 April 1699), was a French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France (along with Molière and Corneille), and an important literary figure in the Western tradition. Racine was primarily a tragedian, producing such \\"examples of neoclassical perfection\\" as \\"Phèdre\\", \\"Andromaque\\", and \\"Athalie\\", although he did write one comedy, \\"Les Plaideurs\\", and a muted tragedy, \\"Esther\\", for the young.\\n\\n- Poseidon (Greek: ) was one of the twelve Olympian deities of the pantheon in Greek mythology. His main domain was the ocean, and he is called the \\"God of the Sea\\". Additionally, he is referred to as \\"Earth-Shaker\\" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the \\"tamer of horses\\". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and a beard.\\n\\n- Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Aegeus or Aegeas, was an archaic figure in the founding myth of Athens. The \\"goat-man\\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens.\\n\\n- Megara is a historic town and a municipality in West Attica, Greece. It lies in the northern section of the Isthmus of Corinth opposite the island of Salamis, which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by Athens. Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythic sons of King Pandion II, of whom Nisos was the ruler of Megara. Megara was also a trade port, its people using their ships and wealth as a way to gain leverage on armies of neighboring poleis. Megara specialized in the exportation of wool and other animal products including livestock such as horses. It possessed two harbors, Pegae, to the west on the Corinthian Gulf and Nisaea, to the east on the Saronic Gulf of the Aegean Sea.\\n\\n- Main injector neutrino oscillation search (MINOS) is a particle physics experiment designed to study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations, first discovered by a Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) experiment in 1998. Neutrinos produced by the NuMI (\\"Neutrinos at Main Injector\\") beamline at Fermilab near Chicago are observed at two detectors, one very close to where the beam is produced (the \\"near detector\\"), and another much larger detector 735 km away in northern Minnesota (the \\"far detector\\").\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, the Pallantidai were the fifty sons of Pallas, nobles of Attica, and rivals of their uncle Aegeus and his son Theseus over the Athenian throne. Diodorus Siculus related that they once became friends with Androgeos, a son of Minos, and that was why Aegeus had Androgeos assassinated, fearing that Pallas and his sons could use this friendship to get assistance from the powerful Minos against him. The Pallantidae and their father marched against Theseus and Aegeus because they hoped to gain control over Athens. According to Plutarch, one half of them under command of Pallas openly marched from Sphettus, while the other half laid an ambush near Gargettus. Their plan failed though, because Leos, their herald, warned Theseus of their schemes and an ambush they had prepared for him. Theseus pre-emptively ambushed the Pallantides and killed all those at Gargettus, whereupon the other half retreated. Other sources state that Theseus killed all the fifty Pallantidae as well as Pallas. A tradition saying that he spared their sister, Aricia, whom he kept as slave, is followed in Jean Racine's \\"Phèdre\\" but is not supported by extant genuinely ancient sources.\\n\\n- Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.\\n\\n- Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.\\n\\n- Diodorus Siculus (\\"Diodoros Sikeliotes\\") ( 1st century BC) or Diodorus of Sicily was a Greek historian. He is known for writing the monumental universal history \\"Bibliotheca historica\\", much of which survives, between 60 and 30 BC. It is arranged in three parts. The first covers mythic history up to the destruction of Troy, arranged geographically, describing regions around the world from Egypt, India and Arabia to Greece and Europe. The second covers the Trojan War to the death of Alexander the Great. The third covers the period to about 60 BC. \\"Bibliotheca\\", meaning 'library', acknowledges that he was drawing on the work of many other authors.\\n\\n- In monotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'pallas ' and 'megara'?","target":"place of birth","rationale":"Here is the rationale: \\"place of birth\\"."},{"source":"In this task, find the most appropriate number to replace the blank (indicated with _ ) and express it in words.\\n\\nSnails have _ pairs of tentacles.","target":"two","rationale":"Snails have two pairs of tentacles."},{"source":"In this task, you are given two sets, and you need to count the number of elements at the union of two given sets.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\nQuestion: What kind of people are being freed?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

MP-12 strain, a live-attenuated candidate vaccine, is attenuated in the M-and L-segments, but the S-segment retains the virulent phenotype. MP-12 was manufactured as an Investigational New Drug vaccine by using MRC-5 cells and encodes a functional NSs gene, the major virulence factor of RVFV which 1) induces a shutoff of the host transcription, 2) inhibits interferon (IFN)b promoter activation, and 3) promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). MP-12 lacks a marker for differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although MP-12 lacking NSs works for DIVA, it does not replicate efficiently in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells, while the use of type-I IFN-incompetent cells may negatively affect its genetic stability. To generate modified MP-12 vaccine candidates encoding a DIVA marker, while still replicating efficiently in MRC-5 cells, we generated recombinant MP-12 encoding Punta Toro virus Adames strain NSs (rMP12-PTNSs) or Sandfly fever Sicilian virus NSs (rMP12-SFSNSs) in place of MP-12 NSs. We have demonstrated that those recombinant MP-12 viruses inhibit IFN-b mRNA synthesis, yet do not promote the degradation of PKR. The rMP12-PTNSs, but not rMP12-SFSNSs, replicated more efficiently than recombinant MP-12 lacking NSs in MRC-5 cells. Mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs induced neutralizing antibodies at a level equivalent to those vaccinated with MP-12, and were efficiently protected from wild-type RVFV challenge. The rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs did not induce antibodies cross-reactive to anti-RVFV NSs antibody and are therefore applicable to DIVA. Thus, rMP12-PTNSs is highly efficacious, replicates efficiently in MRC-5 cells, and encodes a DIVA marker, all of which are important for vaccine development for Rift Valley fever. \\n Title: Characterization of Rift Valley Fever Virus MP-12 Strain Encoding NSs of Punta Toro Virus or Sandfly Fever Sicilian Virus","target":"True","rationale":"The title summarizes the main topic of the research paper, which is the characterization of Rift Valley Fever Virus MP-12 strain encoding NSs of Punta Toro Virus or Sandfly Fever Sicilian Virus.

Here we describe an experiment that uses partially inbred CC lines to evaluate the genetic properties and utility of this emerging resource. Genome-wide analysis of the incipient strains reveals high genetic diversity, balanced allele frequencies, and dense, evenly distributed recombination sites-all ideal qualities for a systems genetics resource. We map discrete, complex, and biomolecular traits and contrast two quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approaches. Analysis based on inferred haplotypes improves power, reduces false discovery, and provides information to identify and prioritize candidate genes that is unique to multifounder crosses like the CC. The number of expression QTLs discovered here exceeds all previous efforts at eQTL mapping in mice, and we map local eQTL at 1-Mb resolution. We demonstrate that the genetic diversity of the CC, which derives from random mixing of eight founder strains, results in high phenotypic diversity and enhances our ability to map causative loci underlying complex disease-related traits.","target":"Genetic analysis of complex traits in the emerging Collaborative Cross","rationale":"The title should include the name of the resource (Collaborative Cross) and describe its genetic properties and utility for studying complex traits.

It is commonly found in freshwater areas, and there are more than 400 species of \\"Spirogyra\\" in the world. \\"Spirogyra\\" measures approximately 10 to 100 m in width and may grow to several centimeters in length.\\n\\n- In vascular plants, phloem is the living tissue that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis (known as photosynthate), in particular the sugar sucrose, to all parts of the plant where needed. This transport process is called translocation. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word (\\"phloios\\") meaning \\"bark\\".\\n\\n- Chlamydomonas is a genus of green algae consisting of unicellular flagellates, found in stagnant water and on damp soil, in freshwater, seawater, and even in snow as \\"snow algae\\" \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is used as a model organism for molecular biology, especially studies of flagellar motility and chloroplast dynamics, biogeneses, and genetics. One of the many striking features of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is that it contains ion channels, (channelrhodopsins), that are directly activated by light. Some regulatory systems of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" are more complex than their homologs in Gymnosperms, with evolutionarily related regulatory proteins being larger and containing additional domains.\\n\\n- In taxonomy, the Volvocales, also known as Chlamydomonadales, are an order of flagellate or pseudociliate green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae. Volvocales can form planar or spherical colonies. These vary from \\"Gonium\\" (4 to 32 cells) up to \\"Volvox\\" (500 cells or more). Each cell has two flagella, and is similar in appearance to \\"Chlamydomonas\\", with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination.\\n\\n- Kelps are large seaweeds (algae) belonging to the brown algae (Phaeophyceae) in the order Laminariales. There are about 30 different genera.\\n\\n- Gonium is a genus of colonial algae , a member of the order Volvocales . Typical colonies have 4 to 16 cells , all the same size , arranged in a flat plate , with no anterior - posterior differentiation . In a colony of 16 cells , four are in the center , and the other 12 are on the four sides , three each . A description by G.M. Smith ( 1920 , p. 94 ) : Gonium Mueller 1773 : Colonies of 4 - 8 - 16 cells arranged in a flat quadrangular plate and embedded in a common gelatinous matrix or connected by broad gelatinous strands . Cells ovoid to pyriform , with a single cup - shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid . Each cell with two cilia of equal length , contractile vacuoles at the base of the cilia , and an eyespot . Four - and eight - celled colonies with the cilia on the same side ; sixteencelled colonies with the four central cells having their cilia on the same side and the twelve marginal cells with radially arranged cilia . Asexual reproduction by simultaneous division of all cells in the colony to form autocolonies , or by a formation of 2 - 4 zoospores in each cell .\\n\\n- A flagellate is a cell or organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. The word \\"flagellate\\" also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many protists (eukaryotic organisms) and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term \\"flagellate\\" is included in other terms (such as \\"dinoflagellate\\" and \\"choanoflagellata\\") which are more formally characterized.\\n\\n- The Chlorophyceae are one of the classes of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology. For example, the chlorophycean CW clade, and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their flagella. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a \\"clockwise\\" (CW, 17 o'clock) direction e.g. Chlamydomonadales. Members of the DO clade have flagella that are \\"directly opposed\\" (DO, 126 o'clock) e.g. Sphaeropleales. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The chloroplast may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of cellulose and outer layer of pectose.\\n\\n- Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 m in diameter, and is without flagella. \\"Chlorella\\" contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. Through photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.\\n\\n- Charophyta is a division of freshwater green algae. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta emerged within Charophyta, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. In some charophyte groups, such as Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagellae are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in stoneworts (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil stoneworts of Devonian age that are similar to those of the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.\\n\\n- Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, phloem being the other. The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to shoots and leaves, but it also transports some nutrients. The word \\"xylem\\" is derived from the Greek word  (\\"xylon\\"), meaning \\"wood\\"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout the plant.\\n\\n- Volvox is a polyphyletic genus of chlorophyte green algae in the family Volvocaceae. It forms spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700. \\"Volvox\\" diverged from unicellular ancestors approximately .\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'gonium' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'.

It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to Britain via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.This plan was frustrated, as Discovery remained firmly icebound. Markham had privately anticipated this, and Morning's captain, William Colbeck, was carrying a secret letter to Scott authorising another year in the ice. This now being inevitable, the relief ship provided an opportunity for some of the party to return home. Among these, against his will, was the convalescent Shackleton, who Scott decided \\"ought not to risk further hardships in his present state of health\\". Stories of a Scott-Shackleton rift date from this point, or from a supposed falling-out during the southern journey which had provoked an angry exchange of words. Some of these details were supplied by Armitage, whose relationship with Scott had broken down and who, after Scott, Wilson and Shackleton were all dead, chose to reveal details which tended to show Scott in a poor light.

The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. Old Norse and Old English resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. It is most “important to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.” This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in “simplifying English grammar.”\\"?","target":"What was different about the languages?","rationale":"The passage talks about the differences between Old English and Old Norse, including their syntax.

Every year, his parents book a week long holiday in June, for my BF, his son, and the parents. I've never been invited and I'm okay with it of course because I always want to encourage him to go and spend time with his family. I should also note that his parents have never accepted me, whenever I see them his parents ignore me, they've never asked me anything about myself or tried to include me in anything. \\n\\nLast week, his mum told us that she's booked the holiday and gave us the dates theyd booked and they're over my birthday. My birthday is in June but it's never clashed with their holiday before. Originally my boyfriend assumed that because she told us while I was there, it meant I was invited but we've since discovered I'm not invited. \\n\\nHe said he won't go if he doesn't want me to, because it's my birthday, but I can tell he really wants to go.

But I don't want to tell him not to go, because it's a week away with his parents and his son, and they always have a really lovely time. I've told my boyfriend a bit of how I feel but I feel really guilty like I'd be stopping him having a good time. I don't want to be a bitch, but I'm also frustrated because this could have been resolved if they just asked my boyfriend what dates would work instead of just booking them, and a bit hurt that after 4 years they still don't know when my birthday is (I don't expect them to know the exact date, but they could have at least learnt which month it was in)","target":"asking my bf not to go on holiday","rationale":"The main issue in this anecdote is the conflict between the daughter-in-law and her boyfriend's parents.

The working-class family consisted of Henry and his eight siblings who grew up in Brownsville, a poorer area of the East New York section of Brooklyn. From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized across the street from his home, including Paul Vario, a capo in the Lucchese crime family. In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand across the street looking for a part-time after-school job.\\n\\nOn April 27, 1980, Hill was arrested on a narcotics-trafficking charge. He became convinced that his former associates planned to have him killed: Vario, for dealing drugs; and Burke, to prevent Hill from implicating him in the Lufthansa Heist. Hill heard on a wiretap that his associates Angelo Sepe and Anthony Stabile were anxious to have him killed, and that they were telling Burke that Hill \\"is no good\\", and that he \\"is a junkie\\". Burke told them \\"not to worry about it\\". Hill was more convinced by a surveillance tape played to him by federal investigators, in which Burke tells Vario of their need to have Hill \\"whacked.\\" But Hill still wouldn't talk to the investigators. While in his cell, the officers would tell Hill that the prosecutor, Ed McDonald, wanted to speak with him, and Hill would yell: \\"Fuck you and McDonald\\". Hill became even more paranoid because he thought Burke had officers on the inside and would have him killed.  While Karen was worried, she kept getting calls from Jimmy Burke's wife, Mickey, asking when Hill was coming home, or if Karen needed anything. Hill knew the calls were prompted by Jimmy.  When Hill was finally released on bail, he met Burke at a restaurant they always went to. Burke told Hill that they should meet at a bar Hill had never heard of or seen before, owned by \\"Charlie the Jap\\". However, Hill never met Burke there; instead they met at Burke's sweatshop with Karen and asked for the address in Florida where Hill was to kill Bobby Germaine's son with Anthony Stabile. Hill knew he was going to get killed in Florida, but he needed to stay on the streets to make money.  McDonald didn't want to take any chances and arrested Hill as a material witness in the Lufthansa robbery. Hill then agreed to become an informant and signed an agreement with the United States Department of Justice Organized Crime Strike Force on May 27, 1980. In 2011, former junior mob associate Greg Bucceroni alleged that, after Hill's 1980 arrest, Jimmy Burke offered him money to arrange a meeting between Bucceroni and Hill at a Brooklyn grocery store so that Burke could have Hill murdered gangland fashion, but Bucceroni decided quietly against having any involvement with the hit on Hill.

Not uncommonly, however, anatomic valve area (AVAA) obtained by planimetry overestimates continuity-derived effective valve area (AVAE) in bicuspid AS.', 'Transthoracic Doppler and transesophageal echocardiography were performed to obtain AVAE and AVAA in 31 patients with bicuspid AS (age 61 +/- 11 years) and 22 patients with degenerative tricuspid AS (age 71 +/- 13 years).

Using these data, a computational fluid dynamics model was constructed to test the effect of these variables in determining the relationship between AVAE and AVAA.', 'For patients with tricuspid AS, the correlation between AVAA (1.15 +/- 0.36 cm2) and AVAE (1.13 +/- 0.46 cm2) was excellent (r = 0.91, P < .001, Delta = 0.02 +/- 0.21 cm2).
