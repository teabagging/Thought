The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). In his first billing, as Louie Jordan's Elks Rendez-vous Band, his name was spelled Louie so people would know not to pronounce it Lewis.  The new band's first recording date, for Decca Records on December 20, 1938, produced three sides on which they backed an obscure vocalist, Rodney Sturgess, and two novelty sides of their own, \\"Honey in the Bee Ball\\" and \\"Barnacle Bill the Sailor\\". These recordings were credited to the Elks Rendezvous Band, but Jordan subsequently changed the name to the Tympany Five, since Martin often used tympani in performance. (The word tympany is also an old-fashioned colloquial term meaning \\"swollen, inflated, puffed-up\\", etymologically related to timpani, or kettledrums, but historically separate.)  The various lineups of the Tympany Five (which often featured two or three extra players) included Bill Jennings and Carl Hogan on guitar, the renowned pianist-arrangers Wild Bill Davis and Bill Doggett, \\"Shadow\\" Wilson and Chris Columbus on drums and Dallas Bartley on bass. Jordan played alto, tenor and baritone saxophone and sang the lead vocal on most songs.

A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s, before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989. A star on multiple stages, Petrovic earned two silver medals and one bronze in Olympic basketball, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA World Cup, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA EuroBasket, and two EuroLeague titles. He represented Yugoslavia's national team and, later, Croatia's national team.\\nContext: Petrovic's national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavian junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavian national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria.  The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrovic's first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslav senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrovic again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrovic win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrovic, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse.  An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrovic's 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslav national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrovic was the tournament's second leading scorer and most valuable player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrovic was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship.\\nQuestion: How did he do in the Olympics?. Whats the answer?","target":"the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal.","rationale":"The context clearly states that Yugoslavia team with Petrovic earned a bronze in the 1984 Olympics.

However, the detailed mechanism underlying hepatocyte infection with HCV is not yet completely understood. We previously identified a novel C-type lectin-LSECtin predominantly expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that LSECtin can interact with two HCV receptors, DC-SIGNR and CD81, through its central ectodomain. Furthermore, cells expressing LSECtin specifically can be attached by the naturally occurring HCV in the sera of infected individuals. This binding was found to be mediated by the HCV E2 glycoprotein and could be efficiently inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan treatment. The present study suggests that LSECtin interaction with DC-SIGNR might contribute to HCV binding to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.","target":"C-type lectin LSECtin interacts with DC-SIGNR and is involved in hepatitis C virus binding","rationale":"The title should provide a brief summary of the research findings that have been made in this paper.

Tom tilled his land, while Brad applied the no-till gardening method.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage.

In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey. A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s, among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse.

POST : My girlfriend’s close friend, Mary, is getting married next summer and my girlfriend and her friend Julia are going to be bridesmaids. To begin with both Julia and Mary told my girlfriend that I have to wear a suit because it would be inconsiderate of me not to, and every other man will be wearing one. I’m not sure that it’s true though that every other man will be wearing one, since there isn’t any official dress code for the wedding. I told my girlfriend that I didn’t want to wear one because I’m a student and suits are very expensive – She understood me and thought it was ok. So, I told Julia and Mary that I don’t want to buy a suit because it’s too expensive for me. Mary does understand me to some extent, but she still thinks it’d be best to wear a suit in order to fit in, but otherwise she wouldn’t mind if I didn’t wear one. But Julia doesn’t understand me at all and seems to think a suit is the only acceptable thing to wear at a wedding, and that I have to wear a suit in order to fit in and be accepted by the others. But since I’d only be buying it for the wedding, I think it’s a waste of money. I told them I was going to be wearing something nice and that I of course wouldn’t show up in sweatpants or something. But it seems like Julia thinks that a suit is the only acceptable thing to wear at a wedding. I would respect if the bride told me I had to wear a suit, but I don’t feel like spending money on a suit just to fit in and to satisfy one of the bridesmaids. I understand that you can’t show up in just anything and you have to look nice, but I don’t understand why it’s so important for her that I wear a suit. Would I be the asshole for not wearing a suit to the wedding?","target":"yes","rationale":"The narrator is a groomsman at a wedding. He initially told his girlfriend and her friends that he did not want to wear a suit, which they all accepted. However, later one of the bridesmaids (Julia) became upset with him and said that he must wear a suit to fit in with the other groomsmen. She seems to think that wearing anything besides a suit would be inappropriate for the occasion. The narrator feels uncomfortable buying an expensive suit just because Julia thinks it's appropriate, but he doesn't seem to have any reasonable justification for not doing so: he says only that it would be \\"\\"a waste of money\\"\\" if he purchased something specifically for this event alone. If Julia decides she wants all the bridesmaids and groomsmen to wear suits at this wedding, there's no reason why she should be wrong in enforcing that dress code on everyone else attending: it's her friend's big day, and she has every right to make sure everything goes as planned without unnecessary drama from inflexible guests like the narrator. If Julia does insist on having everyone wear suits at her friend's wedding (and if Mary also expects this), then it would ultimately be disrespectful of the narrator not to comply with those expectations by wearing something appropriate instead of whatever clothing fits his personal budget or preference in fashion. The answer is 'yes' because while there are shades of grey involved here regarding whether or not anyone was \\"wrong\\" or \\"right\\", ultimately we believe Julia should have been justified in insisting on an expected dress code when someone like the narrator showed up dressed inappropriately."},{"source":"Is \\"Heller altarpiece\\" a correct answer to the following question?\\nQuestion: What pieces created by Durer are named in the paragraph?\\n\\nRely on the following text: The Venetian artist Jacopo de' Barbari, whom Durer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Durer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and proportion from him.

This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name. Durer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the Betende Hande (English: Praying Hands, c. 1508 Albertina, Vienna), a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece.

People would much rather hear a sermon about forgiveness than one about Hell.\\nEverybody wanted to be forgiven. But when it came to forgiving others--many people fight it.

He read a scripture passage.\\nThen came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\\nWhen Greg heard these verses, which he knew by memory, it was like a slap in the face. How many times had he already forgiven his father? But he knew that 'seventy times seven' did not mean literally 490 times. The number 'seven' in the Bible symbolized completeness.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north.\\n\\n- Borrowdale is a valley and civil parish in the English Lake District in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria, England.\\n\\n- A fell (from Old Norse \\"fell\\", \\"fjall\\", \\"mountain\\") is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain range or moor-covered hills. The term is most often employed in Fennoscandia, the Isle of Man, parts of Northern England, and Scotland.\\n\\n- Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface.\\n\\n- A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\\n\\n- The Southern Fells are a group of hills in the English Lake District. Including Scafell Pike, the highest peak in England, they occupy a broad area to the south of Great Langdale, Borrowdale and Wasdale. High and rocky towards the centre of the Lake District, the Southern Fells progressively take on a moorland character toward the south west. In the south east are the well known Furness Fells, their heavily quarried flanks rising above Coniston Water.\\n\\n- The Lake Poets were a group of English poets who all lived in the Lake District of England, United Kingdom, at the turn of the nineteenth century. As a group, they followed no single \\"school\\" of thought or literary practice then known. They were named, only to be uniformly disparaged, by the \\"Edinburgh Review\\". They are considered part of the Romantic Movement.\\n\\n- A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.\\n\\n- Alfred Wainwright (\\"A.W.\\") MBE (17 January 1907  20 January 1991) was a British fellwalker, guidebook author and illustrator. His seven-volume \\"Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells\\", published between 1955 and 1966 and consisting entirely of reproductions of his manuscript, has become the standard reference work to 214 of the fells of the English Lake District. Among his 40-odd other books is the first guide to the Coast to Coast Walk, a 192-mile long-distance footpath devised by Wainwright which remains popular today.\\n\\n- William Wordsworth (7 April 1770  23 April 1850) was a major English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" (1798).\\n\\n- A national mapping agency is an organisation, usually publicly owned, that produces topographic maps and geographic information of a country. Some national mapping agencies also deal with cadastral matters.\\n\\n- A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.\\n\\n- Scafell Pike or is the highest mountain in England, at an elevation of above sea level. It is located in the Lake District National Park, in Cumbria, and is part of the Southern Fells.\\nTopography.\\nScafell Pike is one of a horseshoe of high fells, open to the south, surrounding the head of Eskdale, Cumbria. It stands on the western side of the cirque, with Scafell to the south and Great End to the north. This ridge forms the watershed between Eskdale and Wasdale, which lies to the west.\\n\\n- The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.\\n\\n- A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.\\n\\n- A pyramid (from \\"\\") is a structure whose outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a single point at the top, making the shape roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be trilateral, quadrilateral, or any polygon shape, meaning that a pyramid has at least three outer triangular surfaces (at least four faces including the base). The square pyramid, with square base and four triangular outer surfaces, is a common version.\\n\\n- Wasdale is a valley and civil parish in the western part of the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. The River Irt flows through the valley to its estuary at Ravenglass. A large part of the main valley floor is occupied by Wastwater, the deepest lake in England (258 feet). The population of Wasdale was only minimal and, from the 2011 Census is included in the parish of Gosforth.\\n\\n- Coniston Water in Cumbria is the third largest lake in the English Lake District. It is five miles long by half a mile wide (8 km by 800 m), has a maximum depth of 184 feet (56 m), and covers an area of . The lake has an elevation of 143 feet (44 m) above sea level. It drains to the sea via the River Crake.\\n\\n- The Multinational Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactics Facility Polygone - POLYGON is an Electronic Warfare Tactics Range located on the border between Germany and France. It is a tri-national facility operated by France, Germany and the United States.\\n\\n- Ordnance Survey (OS) is the national mapping agency for Great Britain and is one of the world's largest producers of maps. Since 1 April 2015 it has operated as Ordnance Survey Ltd, a government-owned company, 100% in public ownership. The Ordnance Survey Board remain accountable to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. It is also a member of the Public Data Group.\\n\\n- The Coast to Coast Walk is a unofficial and mostly unsignposted long-distance footpath in Northern England. Devised by Alfred Wainwright, it passes through three contrasting national parks: the Lake District National Park, the Yorkshire Dales National Park, and the North York Moors National Park.\\n\\n- In geometry, a square pyramid is a pyramid having a square base. If the apex is perpendicularly above the center of the square, it will have \\"C\\" symmetry.\\n\\n- Great Langdale is a valley in the Lake District National Park in North West England, the epithet Great distinguishing it from the neighbouring valley of Little Langdale.\\n\\n- A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes.\\n\\n- A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins.\\n\\n- The Furness Fells are those hills and mountains in the Furness region of Cumbria, England. Historically part of Lancashire, the Furness Fells or High Furness is the name given to the upland part of Furness, that is, that part of Furness lying north of the line between Ulverston and Ireleth. The hills lie largely within the English Lake District.\\n\\n- The Lake District, also known as the Lakes or Lakeland, is a mountainous region in North-West England. A popular holiday destination, it is famous for its lakes, forests and mountains (or \\"fells\\") and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'bowfell' and 'cumbria'?","target":"located in the administrative territorial entity","rationale":"The relationship between 'bowfell' and 'cumbria' is that they are located in the administrative territorial entity."},{"source":"Given the following passage\\n\\n\\"At the end of World War II Soviet troops occupied southern Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, making them part of the RSFSR.

AFC was measured in anesthetized, ventilated mice by instillation of 5% bovine serum albumin into the dependent lung. Some mice were pretreated with leflunomide or 6-mercaptopurine.', 'RSV-mediated inhibition of AFC is associated temporally with a 20-nM increase in UTP and ATP content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, hypoxemia, and altered nasal potential difference. RSV-mediated nucleotide release, AFC inhibition, and physiologic sequelae thereof can be prevented by pretreatment of mice with the de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor leflunomide, which is not toxic to the mice, and which does not affect RSV replication in the lungs. In contrast, pretreatment of mice with 6-mercaptopurine, an inhibitor of de novo purine synthesis, has no beneficial effect on AFC or other indicators of disease progression.

This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century, such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud, as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves. However, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and, through the second half of the twentieth century, gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations. An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or androgynous, and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the \\"gender-conforming heterosexual\\" and the \\"gender-nonconforming homosexual\\" as negative stereotypes.

He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”.

However, neuraminidase treatment did not alter the sensitivity of wt HL-60 cells to differentiation induction by RA, hypoxanthine (purine base), or DMSO. These results indicate that differences in peripheral, neuraminidase-accessible sialic acids are important determinants of the gel electrophoretic mobility of the SMGs of the HL-60 line and sublines but are not likely related to the differentiation-resistance mechanism.

Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months.

A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from...\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: David is an environmental scientist.

Meanwhile, the Giants turned the ball over 3 times in the first half, and were shut out at halftime for the second time this season. In the third quarter, Carolina picked up where they left off, as Moore connected with Carolina's Steve Smith for a 27-yard score. The Giants finally got on the board on the ensuing drive, courtesy of a 40-yard Tynes field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Giants' Smith caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Manning, but a subsequent 2-point try failed. Carolina fullback Brad Hoover's 1-yard scoring run later in the fourth sealed the game for the Panthers. The Giants left Giants Stadium the same way they had opened it 33 years earlier; with a demoralizing loss.

It is an off - white powder at room temperature and has the chemical formula Li2TiO3 . It is the anode component of the fast recharging lithium - titanate battery . It is also used as an additive in porcelain enamels and ceramic insulating bodies based on titanates . It is frequently utilized as a flux due to its good stability . In recent years , along with other Lithium ceramics , metatitanate pebbles have been the subject of research efforts towards tritium breeding materials in nuclear fusion applications .\\n\\n- Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red.\\nAlthough many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger.\\n\\n- Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.\\n\\n- Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium.\\n\\n- Corrosion is a natural process, which converts a refined metal to a more chemically-stable form, such as its oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide. It is the gradual destruction of materials (usually metals) by chemical and/or electrochemical reaction with their environment. Corrosion engineering is the field dedicated to controlling and stopping corrosion.\\n\\n- Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine.\\n\\n- The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is  (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:\\n\\n- An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.\\n\\n- In chemistry, the term transition metal (or transition element) has three possible meanings:\\n\\n- In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.\\n\\n- Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge  a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals.\\n\\n- Lithium (from , \\"stone\\") is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, appears only in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\n\\n- Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.\\n\\n- Lithium chloride is a chemical compound with the formula LiCl. The salt is a typical ionic compound, although the small size of the Li ion gives rise to properties not seen for other alkali metal chlorides, such as extraordinary solubility in polar solvents (83.05 g/100 mL of water at 20 °C) and its hygroscopic properties.\\n\\n- A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.\\n\\n- The alkali metals are a group (column) in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.\\n\\n- A mineral oil or paraffin oil is any of various colorless, odorless, light mixtures of higher alkanes from a mineral source, particularly a distillate of petroleum.\\n\\n- A metal (from Greek  \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable  that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking  as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'lithium titanate'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1\\n - acid\\n - alkali\\n - cation\\n - charge\\n - chemical\\n - chemical compound\\n - chemical element\\n - chloride\\n - clay\\n - colloid\\n - color\\n - engineering\\n - environment\\n - fine\\n - formula\\n - group\\n - higher alkanes\\n - human\\n - ion\\n - king\\n - liquid\\n - mass\\n - matter\\n - metal\\n - mine\\n - mineral\\n - name\\n - nucleus\\n - number\\n - organic matter\\n - part\\n - perception\\n - physics\\n - process\\n - ratio\\n - rock\\n - room\\n - sea\\n - shape\\n - size\\n - stable\\n - stable isotope\\n - standard\\n - stone\\n - symbol\\n - temperature\\n - term\\n - the ashes\\n - three\\n - time\\n - variable\\n - volume\\n - water","target":"chemical compound","rationale":"The best answer is \\"chemical compound\\"."},{"source":"Given the sentence \\"A woman in green uniform skates down the road at the fair.\\" is it true that \\"The lady sits in her recliner and watches tv.\\"?","target":"no","rationale":"A woman cannot simultaneously skate down the road and sit in a recliner."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a question and an answer, you would be asked to create the sentence based on the Question-Answer provided.

This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist.

Scandinavian influence was dominant in the northern and western islands, Brythonic culture in the southwest, the Anglo-Saxon or English Kingdom of Northumbria in the southeast and the Pictish and Gaelic Kingdom of Alba in the east, north of the River Forth. By the tenth and eleventh centuries, northern Great Britain was increasingly dominated by Gaelic culture, and by the Gaelic regal lordship of Alba, known in Latin as either Albania or Scotia, and in English as \\"Scotland\\". From its base in the east, this kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the south and ultimately the west and much of the north. It had a flourishing culture, comprising part of the larger Gaelic-speaking world and an economy dominated by agriculture and trade.\\nAfter the twelfth-century reign of King David I, the Scottish monarchs are better described as Scoto-Norman than Gaelic, preferring French culture to native Scottish culture. A consequence was the spread of French institutions and social values including Canon law. The first towns, called burghs, appeared in the same era, and as they spread, so did the Middle English language. These developments were offset by the acquisition of the Norse-Gaelic west and the Gaelicisation of many of the noble families of French and Anglo-French origin. National cohesion was fostered with the creation of various unique religious and cultural practices. By the end of the period, Scotland experienced a \\"Gaelic revival\\", which created an integrated Scottish national identity.

In 1820 he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Lyudmila, amidst much controversy about its subject and style.

Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the 13 Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia. The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Jansz in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company, but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean, claimed the continent for Britain, and named it New South Wales. In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook's botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail, arriving in 1788. Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840.

Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal.

While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.\\nLater, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand.

The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.","target":"group B","rationale":"The passage states that group A antelope have a longer neck and stronger teeth than the other species, so they can feed on fruits in tall trees. The difficulty of feeding is less for these animals, which means it has adapted well to its environment.

Serotonin evoked a dose-dependent and reversible contraction of the detrusor. The reverse response was triggered in trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle--a dose-dependent and reversible relaxation. The maximum amplitude of this relaxation was 85 +/- 15% of the relaxation produced by electrical nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was unaltered by blockade of ganglia, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, cholinergic receptors and prostaglandin synthesis. The serotonin antagonists ketanserin, methysergide and cyproheptadine partly inhibited the effect of serotonin. The antagonism differed in potency on strips of different origin.

For the treatment of latent tuberculosis, isoniazid and rifampicin are given for 3 months, and the introduction of antitumor necrosis factor alpha therapy is delayed at least for one month.

But the world is already experiencing a revolution using RFID technology.\\nAn RFID tag with a tiny chip can be fixed in a product, under your pet's skin, even under your own skin.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.\\nThe young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

But for those who work in factories or in the aervice industry(at hotels,shops and restaurants),it has not been good. Workers from poorer countries are trying to get these types of jobs. They will do the same job for less money. This decreases the pay for that job,so people get paid less to do it.\\nCultures have also been affected by globalization.

Targets of miR-26a involve activators of the cell cycle and Ezh2, a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).

In this task a valid representation of anaphor number agreement should be denoted as 'good' while everything else should be denoted as 'bad'. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match.\\n\\nThis organization hadn't aggravated itself.","target":"good","rationale":"The subject of the sentence is \\"This organization\\", which is singular.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead.\\nAugustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology.

Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.

Passage:Poliovirus is an enterovirus. Infection occurs via the fecal–oral route, meaning that one ingests the virus and viral replication occurs in the alimentary tract. Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as brown fat, reticuloendothelial tissue, and muscle. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads to the development of minor symptoms such as fever, headache, and sore throat. Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates in motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent paralysis. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to respiratory arrest and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis. Paralysis typically persists from days to weeks prior to recovery.","target":"a","rationale":"The passage indicates that poliovirus spreads to other sites in 5% of cases.

Because it relies on buoyancy, which is affected by density, speed and resistance can be impacted by environmental factors like moisture content or changes in temperature. If there are clouds present, this means water vapor (moisture) has condensed and formed particles suspended in the atmosphere with lower air pressure than surrounding clear areas. Since increased humidity reduces drag from wind friction, lowering overall resistance for an object moving through the medium; therefore cloudy air allows for faster movement as opposed to clear air where less atmospheric interference exists between objects traveling at higher speeds such as jet airplanes.

Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom.

He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support. Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John.

British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \\"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent.

A phage is a virus that infects prokaryotes. Phages are estimated to be the most widely distributed and diverse entities in the biosphere, even more numerous than prokaryotic organisms. Phages can be found everywhere their hosts are found, such as in soil, in the intestine of animals, or seawater. Up to 10 9 virions have been found in a milliliter of seawater, and up to 70 percent of marine bacteria may be infected by phages. They are also found in drinking water and in some foods, including fermented vegetables and meats, where they control the growth of bacteria.\\n\\n\\nQ: What is the most widely distributed organism around?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"phages","rationale":"Since the paragraph is about viruses, we can infer that phages are also a type of virus.

A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature.

This memo, drafted by Office of Legal Counsel, Jay Bybee and his assistant John Yoo, is also referred to as the first Torture Memo. Addressed to CIA acting General Counsel John A. Rizzo at his request, the purpose of the memo was to describe and authorize specific enhanced interrogation techniques to be used on Zubaydah. On July 26, 2002 Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo informed the CIA that Attorney General John Ashcroft had approved waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah.  Journalists including Jane Mayer, Joby Warrick and Peter Finn, and Alex Koppelman have reported the CIA was already using these harsh tactics before the memo authorizing their use was written, and that it was used to provide after-the-fact legal support for harsh interrogation techniques. A Department of Justice 2009 report regarding prisoner abuses reportedly stated the memos were prepared one month after Zubaydah had already been subjected to the specific techniques authorized in August 1, 2002, memo. John Kiriakou stated in July 2009 that Zubaydah was waterboarded in the early summer of 2002, months before August 1, 2002, memo was written.  The memo described ten techniques which the interrogators wanted to use: \\"(1) attention grasp, (2) walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard.\\" Many of the techniques were, until then, generally considered illegal. Many other techniques developed by the CIA were held to constitute inhumane and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  As reported later, many of these interrogation techniques were previously considered illegal under U.S. and international law and treaties at the time of Zubaydah's capture. For instance, the United States had prosecuted Japanese military officials after World War II and American soldiers after the Vietnam War for waterboarding. Since 1930, the United States had defined sleep deprivation as an illegal form of torture. Many other techniques developed by the CIA constitute inhuman and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture, and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Were the CIA's tactics deemed effective?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"Many other techniques developed by the CIA were held to constitute inhumane","rationale":"From the context, we can see that many of the CIA's interrogation techniques were considered illegal under U.S. and international law and treaties at the time they were used on Abu Zubaydah (the subject of this paragraph).

In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime.

The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter). The Lions defense held off Dallas for the win. Like the previous week, the Lions came back and won it in the final moments of the game after being down by a large margin at halftime.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.\\n\\n- Startin' with Me is the debut album of country music artist Jake Owen, released in July 2006 (see 2006 in country music) on RCA Records Nashville.

They later compared and exchanged data.\\n\\nWhich researcher studied more about a fine sediment, termed glacial flour?\\n\\nHint: Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.","target":"Danny","rationale":"Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

Although it usually should take a few days or weeks to have your period again, in some cases it can take months to regain your natural menstrual cycle. 2. Heavier Period With Plan B, the periods should be delayed. The periods should come within 7 days of the expected date.

Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change.

We have characterized a 113-kDa immunogenic protein, PF3D7_1431400 (PF14_0293), that possesses coiled-coil structures. The protein is localized on the surfaces of both merozoites and gametocytes, hence the name Plasmodium falciparum surface-related antigen (PfSRA). The processed 32-kDa fragment of PfSRA binds normal human erythrocytes with different sensitivities to enzyme treatments. Temporal imaging from initial attachment to internalization of viable merozoites revealed that a fragment of PfSRA, along with PfMSP1 19, is internalized after invasion. Moreover, parasite growth inhibition assays showed that PfSRA P1 antibodies potently inhibited erythrocyte invasion of both sialic acid-dependent and -independent parasite strains. Also, immunoepidemiological studies show that malaria-infected populations have naturally acquired antibodies against PfSRA. Overall, the results demonstrate that PfSRA has the structural and functional characteristics of a very promising target for vaccine development.","target":"Functional Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum Surface-Related Antigen as a Potential Blood-Stage Vaccine Target The Journal of Infectious Diseases ® 2018;218:778-90","rationale":"I would suggest the following title:\\\\nFunctional Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum Surface-Related Antigen as a Potential Blood-Stage Vaccine Target The Journal of Infectious Diseases ® 2018;218:778-90"},{"source":"Brazil, Australia and Thailand argued that the EU, one of the world's largest exporters, broke WTO farm rules by exceeding limits on export subsidies laid down under WTO's 1994 Agreement on Agriculture.\\n\\nBased on that paragraph can we conclude that the sentence below is true?\\nThe three countries argued that UE, one of the greater exporter of the world, infringed the rules of the OMC when exceeding the limit of the subsidies to the exports indicated under the Agreement on Agriculture of the OMC in 1994.\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"While the two paragraphs talk about similar topics, they do not state exactly the same thing.

Thornton's recording of \\"Hound Dog\\" is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\", and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in February 2013. \\"Hound Dog\\" has been recorded more than 250 times. The best-known version is the July 1956 recording by Elvis Presley, which is ranked number 19 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time; it is also one of the best-selling singles of all time.\\nContext: Two records were released that were neither cover versions of nor answers to Thornton's release, yet used a similar melody without any attribution to Leiber and Stoller. The first was Smiley Lewis's \\"Play Girl\\", credited to D. Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label (Imperial 45-5234) by the end of March 1953. Described as a \\"stomping uptempo boogie rocker\\", it began: \\"You ain't nothin' but a Play Girl / Staying out all night long\\". In April 1955, female impersonator Jesse \\"Big 'Tiny'\\" Kennedy recorded \\"Country Boy\\" accompanied by His Orchestra that was released by RCA's Groove Records (Groove 4G-0106) by May 21. While credited solely to Kennedy, this song has a similar melody to \\"Hound Dog\\": \\"'Country Boy' has a deceptively slouching flip on the 'Hound Dog' motif - this time with Tiny proclaiming proudly that he 'ain't nothing but a country boy'\\".  In the early 1970s Robert Loers, owner of Dutch label Redita Records, found a song with the same melody as \\"Hound Dog\\" called \\"(You Ain't Nuttin' But a) Juicehead\\" on an anonymous acetate at Select-o-Hits, the Memphis distributorship owned by Sam Phillips' brother, Tom, where Sun artifacts were stored.  When Juice Head first appeared on a Redita Records LP [in 1974], it was credited to Rosco Gordon. But it's not Rosco. It simply is not him. Really. Even Rosco confirmed that. It might not even be a Memphis Recording Service demo. Just substitute the words \\"Hound Dog\\" for \\"Juice Head\\" and what have you got? Of course the inspiration for this song came from Big Mama Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\" or perhaps even from Rufus Thomas' \\"Bear Cat\\". But the song's other parent is Eddie Vinson's slowed down \\"Juicehead Blues\\" which harks to the previous decade...If indeed this originated from Sam Phillips' studio, it was nothing that Phillips needed to touch because it was another lawsuit waiting to happen.\\"  Philip H. Ennis sees \\"Two Hound Dogs\\", which was recorded on May 10, 1955, by Bill Haley & His Comets (Decca 29552), as a response to Thornton's recording. While not an answer record in the traditional sense, the lyric characterized \\"Rhythm\\" and \\"Blues\\" as the titular \\"Two Hound Dogs,\\" an apparent testament to the stature of \\"Hound Dog.\\"\\nQuestion: what is the name of this song. Whats the answer?","target":"Country Boy","rationale":"The context mentions a song \\"Country Boy\\" which was recorded by Jesse \\"\\"Big 'Tiny'\\"\\" Kennedy and released on RCA's Groove Records (Groove 4G-0106) in May 1955.

He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s and by the time of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode.

It also mentions that he had two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), but only spent six weeks on bed rest after his second attack.

The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth.

The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize.

The workers can be thought of as a series circuit. If we assume that the load on each truck is identical, then we can think of both trucks as having the same resistance R. We know that in series circuits, the current is constant and equal across all resistors, while voltage (or equivalently power) drops according to V = IR = I(R/w). Thus if one worker takes 6 hours to load one truck with voltage V1 = IR1 and power P1 = I^2*R1/w, then two workers will take 3 hours to fill two trucks with voltage V2 = 2V1 and power P2 = 2P1. However, this assumes that there are no losses due to friction or other inefficiencies; according to Ohm's law V=IR=I(R/w), so these losses would decrease the current I which would increase loading time.

This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia.\\nThe trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary.\\nPersonally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them.\\nAlso, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation.\\nFor instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.\\nIn short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older...\\nWhen might hemorrhoids occur?\\n- After suffering from pain medication.\\n- not enough information\\n- After suffering from constipation.\\n- After suffering from abdominal pain.","target":"After suffering from constipation.","rationale":"The context mentions the possibility of hemorrhoids bleeding or being painful, and also talks about avoiding pain medication because of fear from constipation.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time.

Although no exact date is given for when they first met each other at the mosque (except that this was probably around 1999), we know from the context of their relationship and timeline that it must have been sometime between 1998-1999 because he had already moved there by then.

Flashbacks of some moments in Mark's life showcased him being videotaped as he was extending his congratulations to newlyweds Callie and Arizona. At the end of the speech, he declares that Lexie was the one he wanted to grow old and dance with in their granddaughter's wedding. At 5:00 that day, with Derek and Callie keeping vigil at his bedside, the machines were turned off, and Mark Sloan died shortly thereafter. The following episode reveals that he had a surge of good health upon his return to Seattle Grace before ultimately succumbing to his injuries. His 'surge' allowed him enough energy to advise his protégé Jackson, 'when you love someone, tell them', which is believed to be a reflection on the major obstacle of his failed relationship with Lexie. During this momentary energy, Mark also took the opportunity to make a clean break with his girlfriend, Julia, stating that the situation was not fair to her as he had always loved only Lexie.

Following a punt by Chicago on the opening possession, with great field position, the Patriots stormed 55 yards in just 5 plays, with Tom Brady connecting with Rob Gronkowski for a 6-yard touchdown, the first of three touchdown receptions on the day for Gronkowski. After a Bears punt, the Patriots took over 7 minutes off the clock in driving to the Bears 5-yard line, but could only settle for a 23-yard Gostkowski field goal, and a 10-0 lead. The Bears fortunes didn't get any better and they punted again on their next drive. The Patriots struck again with a five-and-a-half minute, 76-yard drive culminating with a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Wright, pushing the lead to 17-0. On the Bears next drive, McCourty intercepted Jay Cutler at the Bears 22, but the play was nullified by an illegal contact penalty on Brandon Browner. With new life, the Bears marched another 54 yards and Cutler found Matt Forte on a 25-yard touchdown pass, making the score 17-7. Then Patriots took control of the game from there. In a 57-second span, the Patriots scored 3 touchdowns. First, the Patriots marched 80 yards in 10 plays, with Brady throwing a 2-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski. Following a Bears three-and-out, Edelman's 49 yard return plus a 10-yard holding penalty on the Bears' Trevor Scott set the Patriots up at the Bears 9. On the first play, Brady hit LaFell for a 9-yard touchdown. On the first play of the ensuing Chicago possession, Cutler was strip-sacked by rookie defensive end Zach Moore with Rob Ninkovich recovering and returning it 15 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 38-7 lead blowout lead. Revis intercepted Cutler on the last play of the first half, and the Patriots lead stood 38-7. On the first drive of the 2nd half, Brady hit Gronkowski for 46-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. This was Tom Brady's fifth touchdown pass of the day (his third career five touchdown game), and the third for Gronkowski (his second career three touchdown game), extending the lead to a 45-7 massacre. Later in the third quarter, the Bears marched 80 yards with Cutler hitting Martellus Bennett on a 20-yard touchdown pass, with a successful 2 pt. conversion, making the score 45-15. The Patriots countered by marching 71 yards in just under six minutes, extending the lead to 48-15 on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal. With the game well out of reach, backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo took over for Tom Brady. The Bears would score again when Culter marched the bears 80 yards and hit Alshon Jeffery for a 10-yard touchdown pass, with another successful 2 point conversion, making the score, still insurmountable, 48-23. With a short field after an unsuccessful onside kick attempt, the Patriots moved 21 yards before Gostowski made the score 51-23. The Bears Jimmy Clausen drove them to the Patriots 26, but turned the ball over on downs. Garoppolo took a knee to end the game. The Patriots' 51 points were their largest single-game total of the season. Tom Brady made history in the game. This was his 17th career game with four touchdown and zero interceptions which tied him with Drew Brees for the most all time. In addition, this was his 43rd career game with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions which placed him second by Peyton Manning. On top of that, he threw for 354 yards. The Patriots totaled 122 yards rushing as well. Gronkowski and LaFell combined for 20 catches for 273 yards and four touchdowns, with both catching every ball thrown to them. Jay Cutler actually played well, completing 20 of 30 passes for 220 yards and three touchdowns, but threw an interception and lost a fumble. Matt Forte was fantastic, rushing for 114 yards on just 19 carries with a receiving touchdown.

He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives.\\nThe Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

The infusion rate of 0.6 mumol/min/100 gm body weight of TU caused significantly higher bile flow and BSP Tm values compared with the respective control values in rats with only a BSP infusion. These values, however, were significantly lower than values obtained by an equimolar infusion of taurocholate (TC). The higher infusion rates of TU (1.2 and 1.8 mumol/min/100 gm) tended to cause higher bile flow rates, but the BSP Tm value did not increase beyond the value obtained at the lower infusion rate (0.6 mumol/min/100 gm). In the highest TU infusion rate study (1.8 mumol/min/100 gm), plasma BSP concentrations were significantly higher than corresponding control values or values at a lower TU or TC infusion rate. It was concluded that in rats TU can significantly increase the BSP Tm, but to a lesser extent than TC. Furthermore, it was suggested that TU infusion at a higher rate significantly interferes with the hepatic uptake (or storage) of BSP. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numbers that indicate the amount of bile flow and BSP Tm values in rats with different infusion rates for both TC (taurocholate) and TU (tauroursodeoxycholate).

Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.\\n\\nand the situation: Two different countries produced their electricity using different methods.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7.

Their distinctive funk style drew on psychedelic culture, outlandish fashion, science-fiction, and surreal humor; it would have an influential effect on subsequent funk, post-punk, hip-hop, and post-disco artists of the 1980s and 1990s, while their collective mythology would help pioneer Afrofuturism. The collective's origins date back to the doo-wop group the Parliaments, formed by Clinton in the late 1950s in Plainfield, New Jersey. Under the influence of late-1960s artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and Frank Zappa, Clinton later relocated to Detroit and began the sister groups Parliament and Funkadelic, with the former playing an eclectic and more commercial form of funk, and the latter incorporating more influence from psychedelic rock.\\nContext: By the late 1960s Clinton had assembled a touring band to back up the Parliaments, the first stable lineup of which included Billy Bass Nelson (bass), Eddie Hazel (lead guitarist), Tawl Ross (guitarist), Tiki Fulwood (drums), and Mickey Atkins (keyboards). After a contractual dispute in which Clinton temporarily lost the rights to the name \\"The Parliaments,\\" Clinton brought the backing musicians forward. When the band relocated to Detroit, their guitar-based, raw funk sound, with its heavy psychedelic rock influences, inspired \\"Billy Bass\\" Nelson, who coined the name \\"Funkadelic\\". Clinton signed Funkadelic to Westbound Records, and the five Parliaments singers were credited as \\"guests\\" while the five musicians were listed as the main group members. The debut album Funkadelic was released in 1970.  Meanwhile, Clinton regained the rights to the name \\"The Parliaments\\" and initiated another new entity, now known as Parliament, with the same five singers and five musicians but this time as a smoother R&B-based funk ensemble that Clinton positioned as a counterpoint to the more rock-oriented Funkadelic. Parliament recorded Osmium for Invictus Records in 1970, and after a hiatus in which Clinton focused on Funkadelic, Parliament was signed to Casablanca Records and released its debut for that label Up for the Down Stroke in 1974. The two bands began to tour together under the collective name \\"Parliament-Funkadelic.\\"  By this time the original ten-member lineup of Parliament-Funkadelic had begun to splinter, but many others joined for various album releases by either band, leading to a collective with a fluid and rapidly expanding membership. Notable members to join during this period include keyboardist Bernie Worrell, bassist Bootsy Collins, guitarist Garry Shider, and The Horny Horns.  In the 1975-1979 period, both Parliament and Funkadelic achieved several high-charting albums and singles on both the R&B and Pop charts. Many members of the collective began to branch out into side bands and solo projects under George Clinton's tutelage, including Bootsy's Rubber Band, Parlet, and The Brides of Funkenstein, while longtime members like Eddie Hazel recorded solo albums with songwriting and studio help from the collective. The Parliament albums of this period had become concept albums with themes from science fiction and afro-futurism, elaborate political and sociological themes, and an evolving storyline with recurring fictional characters. Parliament-Funkadelic stage shows (particularly the P-Funk Earth Tour of 1976) were expanded to include imagery from science fiction and a stage prop known as the Mothership. These concepts came to be known as the P-Funk mythology.  By the late 1970s the Parliament-Funkadelic collective became over-extended and several key members departed acrimoniously over disagreements with Clinton and his management style. Original Parliaments members Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas departed in 1977 after becoming disillusioned with the influx of new members, and later recorded an album under the name Funkadelic.

I understand why coalmines: as depositories of ancient organic waste, they are particularly prone to methane and carbon monoxide buildup. But why a canary? They are technically exotic, native and (at least originally) endemic to the sub-tropical Canary Islands, which gave them their name. They were also renowned for their singing voice, as found out in this answer, and could presumably be quite expensive. So why would a mining company in Britain and/or America and/or any other English speaking country use such an expensive and exotic bird as a glorified carbon monoxide detector whose sole purpose in life was to suffocate to death? Why wouldn't they use sparrows, or starlings, or some other small songbird native to the area? Are canaries just that easy to breed and keep? Are they super-extra-sensitive to poison gases and thus were the \\"upscale\\" model? Were all small, caged songbirds called \\"canaries\\" as a matter of course? Or did the modern idiom simply opt for alliteration over historical accuracy? \\nAnswer: Male canaries will sing all the time when they're alone in the hope of their song attracting a female. In fact, the main reason for them being held in captivity is their incessant song. This makes them ideal for coal mines; you don't have to concentrate on them or watch them.

The concept of density combines what we know about an objects mass and volume. Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video. \\n\\nQuestion: How can I observe the role density plays?\\nI found this answer \\"By pouring water into ilk\\". Is that correct? Yes or no?","target":"No","rationale":"You can observe the differences between oil and water by putting both liquids into a container. If you put drops of food coloring in each liquid, they will mix with one another but not form new layers because they are both somewhat viscous fluids. However, if you pour some vegetable oil into the cup containing them (vegetable oils have very low viscosity), it won’t mix with either fluid - instead, it forms its own layer on top of the other two! This is because neither water nor food dye has much density compared to that of vegetable oil which explains why helium balloons rise; air itself isn't dense enough to keep them down so up goes your balloon!\\nSo I would say \\"No\\" as answer"},{"source":"Given the following passage\\n\\n\\"The junior U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, Paul Tsongas, announced in 1984 that he would be stepping down for health reasons.

Many animals live in social groups. For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict.

In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing.\\n\\nParagraph: There are two species of animals, the Moops and the Flavins, living in the Jarmal forest in Montana.

The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No. 1 hit single, \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", as well as by hits such as \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\", \\"It's My Life\\", \\"I'm Crying\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-orientated album material.\\n\\nThe original Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and re-formed in late 1975 to record again. Burdon later said nobody understood why they did this short reunion. They did a mini-tour in 1976 and shot a few videos of their new songs like \\"Lonely Avenue\\" and \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\". They released the album in 1977 aptly called Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time, which were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed together with Alan Price and a complete line-up, foreshadowing later events.  All five original band members reunited again in 1983 for the album Ark and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, Nippy Noya on percussion, Steve Gregory on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single \\"The Night\\" reached #48 at the US Pop Singles and #34 at the Mainstream Rock Charts, also gaining success in Greece. They released a second single called \\"Love Is For All Time\\".  The Ark tour consisted of about one-third material from the original 1960s and two-thirds material from Ark or other songs. The latter included the songs \\"Heart Attack\\", \\"No More Elmore\\" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), \\"Oh Lucky Man\\" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to O Lucky Man! by Price), \\"It's Too Late\\", \\"Tango\\", and \\"Young Girls\\" (later released on Burdon's compilation, The Night). On 9 September, they had their first show in New York at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, the tickets for which sold out. A Wembley Arena concert followed on 31 December (supporting The Police) which was released on the Rip it To Shreds live album in 1984 after they had disbanded again.

The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\".\\nThis new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss.\\nAnd Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious.\\nJust as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits. The family had only planned for three months of vacation time a year. Scandal!
