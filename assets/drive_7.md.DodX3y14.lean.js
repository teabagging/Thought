The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states:\\n“Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.”\\nYet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration.

Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre.\\nSymphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal.\\nPerhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.\\n\\n- \`\` The Siren '' is the fourth and last single of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish 's fifth studio album Once . The song was recorded with the London Session Orchestra and includes many exotic instruments , for example an electric violin and a sitar . \`\` Symphony of Destruction '' , a live cover included on the single , was originally performed by Megadeth on their album Countdown to Extinction . It was also released as a bonus track on the platinum edition of \`\` Once '' . The song was performed with previous frontwoman , Anette Olzon , and on September 19 , 2009 , at the Hartwall Areena , the band was supported by two cellists from the Finnish Cello rock band Apocalyptica .\\n\\n- The sitar (or ; Urdu: ) is a plucked stringed instrument used mainly in Hindustani music and Indian classical music. The instrument is believed to have been derived from the veena, an ancient Indian instrument, which was modified by a Mughal court musician to conform with the tastes of his Mughal patrons and named after a Persian instrument called the setar (meaning \\"three strings\\"). The sitar flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries and arrived at its present form in 18th century India. It derives its distinctive timbre and resonance from sympathetic strings, bridge design, a long hollow neck and a gourd-shaped resonance chamber. In appearance, the sitar is similar to the tanpura, except that it has frets.\\n\\n- Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: \\nEuropean art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.\\n\\n- Indian classical music is a genre of South Asian music. It has two major traditions. The North Indian classical music tradition is called \\"Hindustani\\", while the South Indian expression is called \\"Carnatic\\". These traditions were not distinct till about the 16th century. There on, during the turmoils of Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms. However, the two systems continue to have more common features than differences.\\n\\n- Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen.

A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th.

The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \\"Guide Course\\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \\"Maharishi\\", renamed \\"Sexy Sadie\\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \\"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\\"During recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, and McCartney took over the drum kit for \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" (on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well) and \\"Dear Prudence\\". Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" he scorned as \\"granny music shit\\".

They initially signed to Tracklacers production company New Track City and then went on to become runners-up of the fifth series of the ITV reality talent show The X Factor in 2008, coming second to Alexandra Burke. Following their appearance on The X Factor, JLS signed to Epic Records. Their first two singles \\"Beat Again\\" and \\"Everybody in Love\\" both went to number one on the UK Singles Chart.\\n\\nAs well as appearing on numerous TV programmes for promotion of their albums/singles, JLS have had two special TV shows of their own broadcast. The first was an hour-long documentary for ITV2, titled JLS Revealed, which first aired on 7 November 2009. The documentary followed them in the year after they had finished second in The X Factor, capturing them as they toured with Lemar, released their singles and attended the MOBO Awards amongst other highlights. The second show was an hour-long entertainment show for ITV titled This Is JLS, which first aired on 11 December 2010 before the first show of that year's X Factor final. Filmed before a live studio audience, the band performed all of their hits, tracks from the Outta This World album and a special duet with Kylie Minogue on her hit song \\"All the Lovers\\", as well as partaking in surprise hidden camera stunts for lucky fans who had been invited to be in the audience for the show.  The group have also released their own documentary film titled JLS: Eyes Wide Open 3D, making them the first British music act to release a 3D film.

One of my guy friends who I hang out with a few times a year admitted that he liked me a year ago. I told him that I think he’s an awesome guy, but I only see him as a friend and that I am not interested in anything more. I also said that I understand if he no longer wants to be friends with me but he said he didn’t want to lose me as a friend and that he will get over it. \\n\\nThe issue is that when I hang out with this guy it’s still obvious he likes me. When I was home visiting my family for Christmas this issue somehow came up in conversation and my dad and brother said I should cut this friend off to spare his feelings. They said even tho I shut him down he will continue to try to change my mind “because that’s just how guys are”. I said it was unfair because I made my feelings very clear and that if he was still choosing to pursue me he wasn’t respecting my decision and that is not my fault. My brother and dad said that it is my fault because I know his feelings and am still choosing to give him hope by keeping him as a friend and that I should be the bigger person and end the friendship. \\n\\nI guess this struck a nerve with me because I’ve been verbally and physically harassed by men (cat called, groped in bars more times than I can count, hit back when I finally hit the old guy who came up to me and started to grope me), and I’m sick and tired for having to control my actions because “that’s just how guys are”. Obviously those are much more extreme cases but I guess those experiences have influenced my mindset when it comes to this point and makes me more angry and stubborn and perhaps I cannot see the issue clearly. It even angers me that my dad and brother are saying my guy friend will say he’s ok and wants nothing more and it that it’s only natural he will continue to try to win me over. I think that’s deceptive and that if he is doing that then he is only to blame for any pain caused because he is the one who is lying to me and choosing not to respect my decision. I would understand if he was honest with me and said he had to cut me out because I have had another male friend do this in the past and have respected his decision. But then again I’ve also had unreturned feelings for people and so understand it can be heartbreaking. I guess where my issue lies is that the blame is on me to end the friendship because “that’s just how guys are”.\\n\\nSo I’d really love your input Reddit.

Nowadays, they also live in Atlantic waters off the East Coast of the United States. These lionfish are what scientists call an invasive  species  or an \\"alien invader.\\" \\nLocal divers off the coast of North Carolina were not expecting to see what they found one day in August 2002--the beautiful lionfish, common to the warm waters of the western Pacific, but unknown of the Carolina coast. They provided the first solid evidence that lionfish were in the Atlantic. \\nA year later, scientists documented 19 lionfish sightings at eight locations along the North Carolina continental shelf. Then, lionfish were observed off the coasts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and even as far north as Long Island, New York! Between 2000 and 2003, lionfish sightings were reported at 16 different shipwrecks and natural hard bottom locations. During a summer 2004 research expedition, NOAA(The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) scientists collected 155 lionfish at 19 different locations off the North Carolina coast alone. The jump in numbers and distributions over such a short time strongly indicates that the lionfish is reproducing in the Atlantic Ocean. If this is true, it's the first time that a western Pacific fish has populated the U.S. Atlantic coast.\\nThese lionfish were likely released on purpose when people no longer wanted them! The swift and warm Gulf Stream, which transported the floating lionfish eggs from Florida northward, helped the lionfish's Atlantic journey. In Florida waters and along the continental shelf near the Gulf Stream the temperatures are very similar to the lionfish's native waters. \\nHowever, from north Florida upward, the waters along the coastline are too cold in the winter for lionfish to survive. Scientists expect them to survive the winter only at water depths greater than 120ft because this is where the Gulf Stream has influence all year long.

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...","target":"Anderson","rationale":"The context discusses the political career of Hubert Humphrey. The passage mentions two cities where he served as mayor: Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., which is also known as \\"Minnesota Miracle\\".\\nThis suggests that his last name was Anderson since there are only 2 mayors in Minnesota: Jacob Frey (Minneapolis) and Emily Larson (Duluth).

The solid ground was solid only in appearance. It was actually quicksand, which is a deep mass of fine sand mixed with water.\\nHow is quicksand formed? Water pushes up from below the surface and is held by the sand. The grains of sand are forced apart by the water. They cannot hold any weight. The subsurface water may have come from a spring, a river or a stream. Sometimes pools of water near beaches become filled with sand. When the soil under these pools does not allow for good drainage , the sand can become stretches of quicksand.\\nIs it true that a man who steps into quicksand is doomed to  die? No, for men have fought their way from quicksand to firm land again. It is panic  that creates the condition that can result in death, for the more a person struggles, the worse matters become. Quick movements will make the sand give way temporarily , but then it rushes and settles solidly around the body. A man trapped in quicksand should either lie back, or not move at all, except to stretch out his arms. When the weight of the sand his body has displaced equals his weight, he will stop sinking.

It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find?

He worked as a gastroenterologist until he ultimately lost his accreditation from the UK medical register for allegations of unethical behaviour and fraud. In 1998 he authored a widely read research paper claiming that there was a link between the administration of the polyvalent measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the appearance of autism and bowel disease. After the publication of the paper, other researchers were unable to reproduce Wakefield's findings or confirm his hypothesis of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism, or autism and gastrointestinal disease.\\n\\nOn 28 February 1998, a paper written by Wakefield and twelve other authors about twelve children with autism was published in The Lancet. In it, the authors claimed to have identified a new syndrome they called autistic enterocolitis, raising the possibility of a link between a novel form of bowel disease, autism, and the MMR vaccine. The authors noted that the parents of eight of the twelve children linked what were described as \\"behavioural symptoms\\" with MMR, and reported that the onset of these symptoms began within two weeks of MMR vaccination. In the published Lancet summary, known as the \\"interpretation\\", the authors wrote:  We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.  These possible triggers were reported as MMR in eight cases, and measles infection in one. The paper was instantly controversial, leading to widespread publicity in the UK and the convening of a special panel of the UK's Medical Research Council the following month. One 2005 study done based in Japan found that there was no causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism in groups of children given the triple MMR vaccine and children who received individual measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations. In Japan, the MMR vaccine had been replaced with individual vaccinations in 1993.  Although the paper said that no causal connection had been proven, before it was published, Wakefield made statements at a press conference and in a video news release issued by the hospital, calling for suspension of the triple MMR vaccine until more research could be done. This was later criticized as 'science by press conference'. According to BBC News, it was this press conference, rather than the paper in The Lancet, that fuelled the MMR vaccination scare. According to the BBC, he told journalists that \\"it was a 'moral issue' and he could no longer support the continued use of the three-in-one jab for measles, mumps and rubella. 'Urgent further research is needed to determine whether MMR may give rise to this complication in a small number of people,' Dr Wakefield said at the time.\\" He said, \\"If you give three viruses together, three live viruses, then you potentially increase the risk of an adverse event occurring, particularly when one of those viruses influences the immune system in the way that measles does.\\" He suggested parents should opt for single vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella, separated by gaps of one year. 60 Minutes interviewed him in November 2000, and he repeated these claims to the U.S. audience, providing a new focus for the nascent anti-vaccination movement in the U.S., which had been primarily concerned about thiomersal in vaccines.  In December 2001, Wakefield resigned from the Royal Free Hospital, saying, \\"I have been asked to go because my research results are unpopular.\\" The medical school said that he had left \\"by mutual agreement\\". In February 2002, Wakefield stated, \\"What precipitated this crisis was the removal of the single vaccine, the removal of choice, and that is what has caused the furore--because the doctors, the gurus, are treating the public as though they are some kind of moronic mass who cannot make an informed decision for themselves.\\"\\n\\nWhat are behaviourial symptoms mean?","target":"In it, the authors claimed to have identified a new syndrome they called autistic enterocolitis,","rationale":"The quote provided shows that authors claimed to have identified a new syndrome called autistic enterocolitis.\\nThus, the answer is: \\"In it, the authors claimed to have identified a new syndrome they called autistic enterocolitis,\\""},{"source":"The goal is to predict an English answer string for an input English question. \\nQuestion : What is the name of the family in the TV series Outnumbered?\\nAnswer :","target":"Brockman","rationale":"The answer is based on the fact that in Outnumbered, a British situation comedy about family life starring Claire Skinner and Hugh Dennis as Pete and Sue Brockman.\\nHence, the correct answer should be \\"Brockman\\".\\n\\n\\n</code>"},{"source":"Here is a question about this article: Elizabeth's many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and reciprocal visits to and from the Pope.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed] Question: In a steam turbine, what are rotors mounted on?","target":"drive shaft","rationale":"The given passage states \\"A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of stators (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing\\""},{"source":"Solve this math problem\\n\\nSolve -16478*i = -322174 - 158280 + 42003 - 105323 for i.","target":"33","rationale":"-16478*i = -322174 + 158280 - 42003 + 105323\\n\\nSimplifying the left-hand side of the equation:\\n\\n33305 = 16478 i"},{"source":"In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of the quantity of a particular object and are supposed to find out the answer for a given question.

He needed to find causes of wildfires and suggest preventive measures. First, he visited a dense forest. He marked it as location A. Then he visited a grassland, which he marked as location B. After that, he visited a location where he did not find any sign of drought. He marked it as time A. He then visited the same location a year later, and found that the place was facing a severe drought. He marked it as time B.\\n\\nHint: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from...","target":"more","rationale":"Based on the context, in time B there are more wildfires than in time A.\\nThis is because the place shown as location B has less dense material such as grasses and leaves that are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser materials like branches and tree trunks.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]\\n\\nThe continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which fruits had most probably not gone through heated sugar syrup, bowl A or bowl B?","target":"bowl B","rationale":"The background explains that candied fruit consists of soaking whole or pieces of fruits in heated sugar syrup. Bowl B contains non-glace fruits, which means they have not been soaked in this syrup. The instructor is comparing the glace and non-glace fruits to demonstrate how the process works, so both bowls contain a mixture of glaced (bowl A) and unglacified (bowl B) fruit.

Bob noted one time when a screaming Graham had scarlet fever \\"That boy's screaming on key!

Dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less soluble. As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the oceans increases, contributing to oceanic acidification. Coral reefs are particularly sensitive to the acidification of the ocean, since the exoskeletons of the coral polyps are soluble in acidic solutions. Humans contribute to the changing of seawater composition by allowing agricultural runoff and other forms of pollution to affect our oceans. Solutions are crucial to the processes that sustain life and to many other processes involving chemical reactions. In this chapter, we will consider the nature of solutions, and examine factors that determine whether a solution will form and what properties it may have. In addition, we will discuss colloids—systems that resemble solutions but consist of dispersions of particles somewhat larger than ordinary molecules or ions.\\n\\n\\nQ: Dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less what?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"soluble","rationale":"The provided paragraph indicates that dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less soluble.

We meet via mutual friends and I've known that I liked her for a few months now. \\n\\nAbout three weeks ago I was completely honest and told her through text how I felt about her and that I've been wanting to tell her for a while now that I liked her and asked how she felt back. She told me that's she glad I got that off my chest but proceeded to tell me she didn't feel the same back and saw me as a friend only. I was a little hurt because I really really do like this girl and was hoping that she would like me back. After I asked would she say yes if I asked her out in which she responded, \\"Probably not.\\" \\n\\nI didn't take that as a clear no so over the pass three weeks I've been talking to her still over text and throwing hints that I wanna ask her out and every time I bring it up she would give the same \\"Probably not\\" response. \\n\\nThough the pass week everytime I call her she won't answer and she barely responds to my texts anymore.  About two days ago was the last time I asked her if she would say yes and she just told me she didn't didnt want to talk to me for a while and that she'll cut me off if I continue to ask. I told her that I understand and that I'll stop bringing it up for now.\\n\\nNext week our friend group is planning on going out somewhere to hang and I'm planning on asking her out in person maybe in front of our friends and see what she says because I truly believe she's just too shy to say yes and think she needs a little motivation. I think of myself as a decent  guy and never have been rude or disrespectful to her the 2 years I've known her. \\n\\nAm I the asshole for continuing to pursue her? I am giving her the space she asked for.","target":"yes","rationale":"By continuing to pursue the girl, the author is disregarding her clear wish to not be in a romantic relationship. The author initially asked if he could date her, and she said \\"\\"no\\"\\". She has also repeatedly rejected his advances since then. The answer is 'yes' because pursuing someone after they have made it clear that they are not interested can be viewed as harassment or stalking behavior."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

The room (2 queens) was plenty big, enormous walk in closet, well appointed bathroom. Nice view of the city from room 608. Room service was speedy, but quite expensive ($27 in food ended up costing $45 with tips, fees, taxes, etc). Reception was speedy, friendly, helpful. The concierge service was fabulous--tips, advice, tickets, anything our hearts desired. Baggage service took extra precautions with my lap top, and immediately produced our stuff when we needed our bags. The health club receptionist recommended I join the President's Club (------------, took about 2 minutes and they only wanted basic demographics). My President's Club number saved me the $10/day gym fee and the $13.95/day internet access fee. It also got me clean work out wear to borrow (I forgot my running shoes). The only service problem was waiting over an hour for a maid to bring me the shoes. I'm sure the rack rate is steep, but I would return to the hotel without a second thought if I could get a deal.

J. Quinn Thornton described an early capitol building as 20 by 40 feet with a platform at one end for the president. One of the private buildings this government used was constructed by John L. Morrison in 1850; it served as a capitol until the government moved to Salem. Governor Joseph Lane affirmed Oregon City's status as capital by proclamation. In 1850, the legislature passed an act designating Salem the capital. However, Governor John P. Gaines refused to relocate and remained in Oregon City along with the Oregon Supreme Court (except Justice Orville C. Pratt) until an act of Congress on May 14, 1852, settled the matter in Salem's favor.\\nOn January 13, 1855, the Oregon Territorial Legislature passed a bill moving the seat of government from Salem to Corvallis. Governor George Law Curry and many others objected to the move, since public buildings in Salem were already under construction. Curry sent the matter to the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, D.C., where Secretary James Guthrie declared the move invalid unless acted on by the United States Congress. Thereafter, Curry and Oregon Secretary of State Benjamin Harding moved back to Salem.\\nOn December 3, 1855, the legislature convened in Corvallis and quickly introduced legislation to move the capital back to Salem. This bill passed on December 15, 1855. Three days later, the legislature re-convened in Salem. However, the statehouse burned down on the 29th, and the legislature re-opened debate about where to seat the capital. They decided to ask the people of the territory to vote on the question. A vote was to be held in June 1856, after which the two cities receiving the most votes would have a runoff.

Since no single choice won 50% of the vote (the threshold for victory), there were two run-off elections held on June 5th and 12th between Eugene City and Corvallis.

He was one of the most successful road cyclists of the 1980s, and one of the finest classics riders of all time. From turning professional in 1977 until his retirement in 1994, he won nine monument classics, and 193 professional races in total. He won Paris-\\n\\nKelly returned in April to the 1988 Vuelta a Espana which started on the rugged mountainous island of Tenerife where his team struggled in the second stage, losing the influential rider Thomas Wegmuller to dysentery and losing further time in the time-trial around Las Palmas. However, on the Spanish mainland, Kelly concentrated on winning sprint time bonuses, battling with sprinter Jorge Dominguez, the BH teammate of leader, Laudelino Cubino.  After regaining a minute in four days, the race reached the mountains where Kelly relied on help from Robert Millar of team Fagor-MBK to stay within two minutes of Cubino after the mountain trial to Alto Oviedo. He then finished fourth behind stage-winner Fabio Parra and Anselmo Fuerte on stage 13 to the ski-station at Cerler, cutting a minute and a half into Cubino's lead. From this stage, Fuerte had moved into second overall and later took the jersey from Cubino on the 16th stage to Albacete when the leader got caught on the wrong side of a split caused by cross-winds.  Kelly maintained the gap between himself and Fuerte and started the time trial on the second last day 21 seconds behind. Confident that he could overhaul the leader, he \\"put it in a big gear and gave it everything\\". He took the leader's amarillo jersey, beating Fuerte by almost two minutes.

Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. Spectra taken of these distant galaxies showed a red shift in their spectral lines presumably caused by the Doppler effect, thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point.

According to Mclean, \\"When students learn the answers to these questions, they are better prepared to recognize opportunities for inventing and more motivated to give inventing a try. \\"\\nHer students agree. One young man with a patent for an unbreakable umbrella is walking proof of McLean's statement.  \\"If I had not heard the story of the windshield wiper' s invention,\\" said Tommy Lee, a senior physics major.  \\"I never would have dreamed of turning my bad experience during a rain storm into something so constructive. \\" Lee is currently negotiating to sell his patent to an umbrella producer.\\nSo, just what is the story behind the windshield wiper? Well, Mary Anderson came up with the idea in 1902 after a visit to New York City.  The day was cold and stormy, but Anderson still wanted to see the sights, so she jumped aboard a streetcar. Noticing that the driver was struggling to see through the snow covering the windshield,  she found herself wondering why there couldn' t be a built - in device for cleaning the window. Still wondering about this when she returned home to Birmingham, Alabama, Anderson started drafting out solutions.  One of her ideas, a lever   on the inside of a vehicle that would control an arm on the outside, became the first windshield wiper.\\nToday we benefit from countless inventions and innovations.

The victory followed a year that included wins over #9 Pittsburgh and Saint Joseph's.

In 2006, the Bison continued their success with high-profile victories at Syracuse, then ranked 19th, DePaul, and Saint Joseph's, a sequence that saw the Bison nearly enter the Associated Press's top-25 rankings. However, those wins were followed by high-profile losses against Villanova, then ranked fourth in the nation, and at Duke, then ranked first. Patriot League play began after the Duke loss, and the Bison did not lose a league game in 2006. The team was ranked 24th in the nation in both the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today college basketball polls for the week of February 13. This was the Bucknell program's first national ranking, and the first time since the league's creation in 1990 that any Patriot League men's basketball team has been ranked. The team was seeded ninth in the Oakland bracket for the 2006 NCAA tournament, and defeated Arkansas in the first round (59–55). The Bison were defeated by Memphis in the second round, losing by a score of 72–56. They finished the regular season ranked 25th in the ESPN poll.

This animation shows how energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft, which spins a generator to create electricity. Wind turbines are mounted on a tower to capture the most energy. Most people think of generating electricity with wind turbines when the subject is wind energy. There are many other ways we can harness the kinetic energy in the wind (also known as motional energy). The energy in the wind has been used in sailboats for thousands of years. Midwest Rural Energy Council Wind turbines generate electrical power in the same way as all other generation technologies. The only difference is in the source of the mechanical power supplied to the electrical generator: wind, rather than a diesel engine or steam turbine, pro­ vides the energy. Blades capture energy in the wind and turn the turbines. Control Where exactly does wind energy come from? How can we generate electricity from the wind? What are some other uses for wind energy? If you are looking to find answers for questions like these, you are at the right place. What Is Wind Energy? By the term wind energy we mean air in motion (kinetic energy). Generating Electricity from Wind Energy With Wind Turbines. A wind turbine is in many ways the opposite of a fan. Instead of providing the electricity to get the fan to rotate, wind rotates the turbine to generate electricity. So, how exactly does wind energy produce electricity? The rotor blades on a wind turbine catches the kinetic energy in the wind and transfers it via a rotor shaft to the generator. The wing blades can be rotated and adjusted to the wind direction and strength, for maximum utilization of energy. When the rotor spins, the power is transferred via the drive shaft and gearbox. Generating Electricity from Wind Energy With Wind Turbines A wind turbine is in many ways the opposite of a fan. Instead of providing the electricity to get the fan to rotate, wind rotates the turbine to generate electricity. Wind itself does not generate electricity, but using wind turbines it is converted into mechanical energy and the mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy. Simp…ly stated, a wind turbine works the opposite of a fan. Instead of using electricity to make wind, like a fan, wind turbines use wind to make electricity.

Skip navigation Energy can be changed from one form of energy to another. The energy of the air moving is changed to the energy of the blades spinning. The blades turn a generator.

Wind turbines have a cut­in wind speed, typi­ cally about 8 to 9 mph, when they will start to produce a small amount of electricity.

Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \\"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \\"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \\"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body.

A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade.

She was the eldest grandchild and heiress of Robert Child, principal shareholder of the banking firm Child & Co. Lord Jersey added the surname Child to the Villiers surname by royal licence in 1819. Lady Jersey was one of the great hostesses of English society, a leader of the ton during the Regency era and the reign of George IV, and a patroness of Almack's. Lord Jersey was an ardent fox hunter and a breeder and trainer of horses, owning two Epsom Derby winners, in Mameluke (1827) and Bay Middleton (1836) as well as other notable thoroughbreds such as Glencoe.

Further encounters with Ola Okuniewska (Ola Wolpe) and Clement Greenberg also impacted his work. His passion for geometry continued throughout his career, right up until the present day. During the mid-70s he started teaching in London. His extensive knowledge of the techniques of painting led to him giving a series of demonstrations at the National Gallery and at several art colleges. In London he founded the Essendine Art Centre, where he taught advanced printmaking, life drawing and techniques of painting to young art college graduates.

He served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution. As a driving force behind the nation's establishment he came to be known as the \\"father of the country,\\" both during his lifetime and to this day. Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he inherited.\\n\\nWashington's introduction to surveying began at an early age through school exercises that taught him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party to lay out large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where Washington gained invaluable experience in the field.  Washington began his professional career in 1749 at the age of 17, when he was appointed county surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia. He subsequently received a commission and surveyor's license from the College of William & Mary. He completed his first survey in less than two days, plotting a 400-acre parcel of land. He was subsequently able to purchase land in the Shenandoah Valley, the first of his many land acquisitions in western Virginia.  For the next four years, Washington worked surveying land in Western Virginia for the Ohio Company, a land investment company funded by Virginia investors. He came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, thanks to Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia. In October 1750, Washington resigned his position as an official surveyor, though he continued to survey professionally for two more years before receiving a military appointment as adjutant for southern Virginia. By 1752, Washington completed close to 200 surveys on numerous properties totaling more than 60,000 acres. He continued to survey at different times throughout his life and as late as 1799.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he join?","target":"join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir.","rationale":"The question asks whether George Washington joined \\"a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir\\", which is true as stated in the article.\\nTherefore, to answer this question we should take a quote from the passage mentioning that: he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir.\\""},{"source":"What was the response?

His family moved to Tuakau, south of Auckland, in 1920, after his father, who served at Gallipoli with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, was allocated land there. His grandparents had emigrated from Yorkshire to northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century.\\nContext: Hillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960-1961, and 1963-1965. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.  In 1960 Hillary organized an expedition to search for the fabled abominable snowman. Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten. No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope. Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\".  In 1962 he was a guest on the television game show What's My Line?; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin. In 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source. From 1977 to 1979 he commentated aboard Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand. In 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest. This accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as Three Poles Challenge. In January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica as part of a delegation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base.\\nQuestion: What happened during the Abominable snowman expedition?.

He worked out the mechanics of being able to mold and shape this plywood into three dimensions. From this plywood he made a canoe that was molded from one piece of plywood. The canoe plywood was shaped by hydraulic presses as an innovation devised by Haskell. The unusually designed canoe of no skeleton framework or ribs was given the brand name Arex (\\"king of the water\\") and made out of the Haskell Manufacturing Company building on N. Rowe Street in Ludington, Michigan. It later became better known just as the Haskell canoe. Haskell formed the Haskell Manufacturing Company in 1916 to make boats and canoes.

First, mantle rock melts. The molten rock collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands. The hot rock is less dense than the surrounding rock. The magma rises toward the surface through cracks in the crust. A volcanic eruption occurs when the magma reaches the surface. Lava can reach the surface gently or explosively. Eruptions can be explosive or non-explosive. Only rarely do gentle and explosive eruptions happen in the same volcano. An explosive eruption produces huge clouds of volcanic ash. Chunks of the volcano fly high into the atmosphere. Explosive eruptions can be 10,000 times as powerful as an atomic bomb (Figure 8.6). Hot magma beneath the surface mixes with water. This forms gases. The gas pressure grows until it must be released. The volcano erupts in an enormous explosion. Ash and particles shoot many kilometers into the sky. The material may form a mushroom cloud, just like a nuclear explosion. Hot fragments of rock, called pyroclasts, fly up into the air at very high speeds. The pyroclasts cool in the atmosphere. Some ash may stay in the atmosphere for years. The ash may block out sunlight. This changes weather patterns and affects the temperature of the Earth. For a year or two after a large eruption, sunsets may be especially beautiful worldwide. Volcanic gases can form poisonous, invisible clouds. The poisonous gases may be toxic close to the eruption. The gases may cause environmental problems like acid rain and ozone destruction. Mt St. Helens was not a very large eruption for the Cascades. Mt. Mazama blew itself apart in an eruption about 42 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens in 1980. Today all that remains of that huge stratovolcano is Crater Lake (Figure 8.18). Some volcanic eruptions are non-explosive (Figure 8.7). This happens when there is little or no gas. The lava is thin, fluid and runny. It flows over the ground like a river. People generally have a lot of warning before a lava flow like this reaches them, so non-explosive eruptions are much less deadly. They may still be destructive to property, though. Even when we know that a lava flow is approaching, there are few ways of stopping it! Great volcanic explosions and glowing red rivers of lava are fascinating. All igneous rock comes from magma or lava. Remember that magma is molten rock that is below Earths surface. Lava is molten rock at Earths surface. Magma forms deep beneath the Earths surface. Rock melts below the surface under tremendous pressure and high temperatures. Molten rock flows like taffy or hot wax. Most magmas are formed at temperatures between 600o C and 1300o C (Figure 8.8). Magma collects in magma chambers beneath Earths surface. Magma chambers are located where the heat and pressure are great enough to melt rock. These locations are at divergent or convergent plate boundaries or at hotpots. The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. Thicker magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. When magma is fluid and runny, it often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava. The way lava flows depends on what it is made of. Thick lava doesnt flow easily. It may block the vent of a volcano. If the lava traps a lot of gas, the pressure builds up. After the pressure becomes greater and greater, the volcano finally explodes. Ash and pyroclasts shoot up into the air. Pumice, with small holes in solid rock, shows where gas bubbles were when the rock was still molten. Fluid lava flows down mountainsides. The rock that the flow becomes depends on which type of lava it is and where it cools. The three types of flows are aa, pahoehoe, and pillow lava. Aa Lava Aa lava is the thickest of the non-explosive lavas. Aa forms a thick and brittle crust, which is torn into rough, rubbly pieces. The solidified surface is angular, jagged and sharp.

Passage:Despite being forced to retire from pro boxing Díaz kept in shape by lifting weights at a local gym. The gym owner was impressed with Díaz physique and work ethics and recommended he become a luchador. Díaz was originally trained by Ray Carrasco and later also trained under Rogelio de la Paz, Genaro Contreas, Raul Rojas and Daniel García; the latter would later be famous under the name of \\"Huracán Ramírez\\". Díaz made his professional wrestling debut in 1954, using the ring name \\"El Pelón\\" (Spanish for \\"Baldy\\") Chato Díaz, then later on worked under names such as \\"Indio\\" Mendoza, El Rayo Rojo and El Hombre del Rayo Rojo. He also worked for a while as an enmascarado (masked) character called Gargantua between 1954 and 1955. In 1955 Díaz came up with the ring name \\"Ray Mendoza\\" after his mentor Ray Carrasco and his wife's maiden name Mendoza. As Mendoza he quickly forged a very effective Rudo character (\\"bad guy\\") by using well developed physique and charisma to create a ring character that the fans loved to hate. In 1956 Mendoza began working for Salvador Lutteroth's Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), the world's oldest and Mexico's largest wrestling promotion. He made his debut at EMLL's main arena Arena Coliseo in February, 1956 in a Battle Royal that also included EMLL headliners Gory Guerrero, El Santo, Cavernario Galindo, Blue Demon and Black Shadow, a match that immediately established him as someone who Lutteroth saw potential in. In EMLL Mendoza struck up a friendship with René Guajardo and Karloff Lagarde out of the ring and a \\"partnership in crime\\" in the ring as the three became one of the most hated trio in lucha libre at the time. The three drew full houses all over Mexico, setting box office record after box office record as they faced técnicos(good guys) such as El Santo, Rayo de Jalisco or Blue Demon. They also had a very financially successful feud with Los Espantos (Espanto I, Espanto II, and Espanto III) in what at the time was a rare rudo vs. rudo feud. Outside the ring Mendoza, Guajardo and Lagarde often spoke out on behalf of the wrestlers, demanding higher pay and better conditions, and since they were able to generate a lot of ticket sales EMLL officials listened to their demands.","target":"a","rationale":"Yes.

According to his later account, when two of his guests asked him about the possibility of organising a sea excursion, he put them in touch with Bown. On the evening of Saturday 30 July, amid celebrations following England's victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, Bown and his friend Jeffrey Stock, a qualified engineer, visited Greatwood. They found that enthusiasm for a sea trip had spread to many of the guests, and an agreement was made to take a large party to Fowey the following day. Different accounts were given later of the financial basis for the proposed hire – whether it was to be a fixed charge or a rate per head is uncertain.Barratt, the boat's legal owner, professed ignorance of the arrangements made at Greatwood, believing, he said, that Bown had gone there to discuss with Rainbird future charter work once the necessary licences had been obtained. Under local regulations, a licence for carrying up to 12 passengers was subject to examination of the boat by the harbourmaster, who would also require the person in charge to be a licensed skipper. Vessels proposing to carry more than 12 passengers needed a licensed master, a qualified marine engineer, and a Class III Passenger Certificate from the Board of Trade. This certificate was only granted to vessels in good condition with watertight hull compartments, a two-way radio, a qualified radio operator and a range of safety devices. Darlwyne had no radio, no distress flares, and carried only two lifebelts. Bown had apparently begun enquiries with the Falmouth Harbour Commission, but neither he nor Darlwyne possessed any of the licences needed for the boat to operate commercially.\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat are the last names of the people who found enthusiasm for a sea trip had spread to many of the guests?","target":"Bown","rationale":"The context tells us that Bown and his friend Jeffrey Stock, a qualified engineer, visited Greatwood.

QRS duration during incremental ventricular pacing was used as an index of rate-dependent changes in intraventricular conduction. The mean plasma procainamide concentrations corresponding to the incremental doses were 5.5 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD), 9.0 +/- 1.6, 12.6 +/- 2.2, and 16.3 +/- 3.2 mg/liter. Each incremental dose of procainamide up to a dose of 30 mg/kg resulted in a significant increment in right ventricular effective refractory period and each dose up to 22.5 mg/kg potentiated a rate-dependent prolongation of QRS duration. After the 7.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in eight of 31 patients. After higher doses of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in two additional patients. In three of 10 patients in whom the induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by 7.5, 15, or 22.5 mg/kg of procainamide, sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after a higher dose of procainamide. In three of 31 patients, only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible after a 7.5 to 22.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide; however, in two of these three patients, sustained ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after administration of a higher dose of procainamide. In conclusion, during electropharmacologic testing with procainamide, it is worthwhile to test a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, because this dose is often effective in patients who respond to this drug. However, the results of this study indicate that procainamide may be effective in suppressing the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia at a relatively low plasma concentration, but not at a higher plasma concentration. Therefore, during long-term therapy with procainamide it may be important to avoid plasma procainamide concentrations not only lower, but also higher than the concentration that results in the suppression of induction of tachycardia. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Acetylprocainamide 2)Aged 3)Cardiac Pacing, Artificial 4)Dose-Response Relationship, Drug 5)Drug Evaluation 6)Electrocardiography 7)Female 8)Heart Catheterization 9)Heart Conduction System 10)Heart Ventricle 11)Human 12)Infusions, Intravenous 13)Male 14)Middle Age 15)Procainamide 16)Prospective Studies 17)Tachycardia","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides information about a study that investigated the short-term effects of different dosages of procainamide on right ventricular effective refractory period, intraventricular conduction, and induction of ventricular tachycardia in patients with a history of sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia.

In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics.

The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art, especially poetry and literature.

In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.\\n\\n- History.\\nUntil the Meiji Restoration, Ehime Prefecture was known as Iyo Province. Since before the Heian period, the area was dominated by fishermen and sailors who played an important role in defending Japan against pirates and Mongolian invasions.\\n\\n- Jazz fusion (also known as jazz-rock) is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and Latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice.\\n\\n- A synthesizer (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate new electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called \\"sound modules\\", and are controlled via MIDI or CV/Gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller.\\n\\n- Latin jazz is a genre of jazz with Latin American rhythms. Although musicians continually expand its parameters, the term \\"Latin jazz\\" is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply \\"jazz from Latin America\\". Some Latin jazz typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa, or exhibit an African influence.\\nThe two main categories of Latin jazz are:\\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n- Toshinori Kondo ( December 15 , 1948 in Ehime Prefecture ) is an avant - garde jazz and jazz fusion trumpeter . He resides in Tokyo , New York City , and Amsterdam . He attended Kyoto university in 1967 , and became close friends with percussionist Tsuchitori Toshiyuki . In 1972 the pair left university , and Toshiyuki went on to work with Peter Brook , while Kondo joined Yosuke Yamashita . In 1978 he moved to New York , and began performing with Bill Laswell , John Zorn , Fred Frith , and Eraldo Bernocchi amongst others . A year later he released his first recording , and toured Europe with Eugene Chadbourne , and collaborated with European musicians such as Peter Brotzman . Returning to Japan , he worked with Ryuichi Sakamoto , Kazumi Watanabe , and Herbie Hancock . In the mid- 1980s he began focussing on his own career , blending his avant - garde origins with electronic music , and has collaborated with numerous musicians around the world since then . In 2002 he worked on an international peace festival in Hiroshima after being approached by the Dalai Lama about organizing one . He is a former member of Praxis .

The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.\\n\\n- Avant-garde jazz (also known as avant-jazz) is a style of music and improvisation that combines avant-garde art music and composition with jazz. It originated in the 1950s and developed through the 1960s. Originally synonymous with free jazz, much avant-garde jazz was distinct from that style.\\n\\n- The avant-garde (from French, \\"advance guard\\" or \\"vanguard\\", literally \\"fore-guard\\") are people or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox, with respect to art, culture, and society. It may be characterized by nontraditional, aesthetic innovation and initial unacceptability, and it may offer a critique of the relationship between producer and consumer.\\n\\n- Jazz harmony is the theory and practice of how chords are used in jazz music. Jazz bears certain similarities to other practices in the tradition of Western harmony, such as many chord progressions, and the incorporation of the major and minor scales as a basis for chordal construction. In jazz, chords are often arranged vertically in major or minor thirds, although \\"stacked fourths\\" are also quite common. Also, jazz music tends to favor certain harmonic progressions and includes the addition of \\"tensions\\", intervals such as 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths to chords. Additionally, scales unique to style are used as the basis of many harmonic elements found in jazz. Jazz harmony is notable for the use of seventh chords as the basic harmonic unit more often than triads, as in classical music. In the words of Robert Rawlins and Nor Eddine Bahha, \\"7th chords provide the building blocks of jazz harmony.\\"\\n\\n- Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation.\\n\\n- History.\\nThe ancient provincial capital was near modern Imabari. During the Sengoku Period it was split into several fiefs, the largest one usually being run from Matsuyama Castle in Matsuyama. It was briefly unified by the Chsokabe clan of neighboring Tosa, but Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Shikoku in 1584 and reallocated the fiefs. During the Edo Period the province was controlled by Uwajima Domain.\\n\\n- Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular.\\nIn the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.\\n\\n- Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'toshinori kondo' with the relationship of 'place of birth'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- africa\\n - band\\n - capital city\\n - court\\n - ehime prefecture\\n - garde\\n - hammond\\n - harmony\\n - imabari\\n - island\\n - iyo\\n - japan\\n - joy\\n - kyōto\\n - matsuyama\\n - most\\n - normal\\n - of\\n - orleans\\n - pacific\\n - rawlins\\n - russia\\n - strong\\n - taiwan\\n - tradition","target":"imabari","rationale":"'Toshinori Kondo' was born in Ehime Prefecture. \\nImabari is the city located within this prefecture and also known as 'the ancient provincial capital before Toshinori's birth'.

The location was not ideal, being several miles away from navigable water. In 1850, William Heath Davis promoted a new development by the Bay shore called \\"New San Diego\\", several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only a few houses, a pier and an Army depot. In the late 1860s, Alonzo Horton promoted a move to the bayside area, which he called \\"New Town\\" and which became Downtown San Diego. Horton promoted the area heavily, and people and businesses began to relocate to New Town because of its location on San Diego Bay convenient to shipping. New Town soon eclipsed the original settlement, known to this day as Old Town, and became the economic and governmental heart of the city. Still, San Diego remained a relative backwater town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 1878.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Davis promoted a new development","rationale":"According to the above context, Davis promoted a new development in 1850 which was several miles south of the original settlement.

Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\\n\\nQuery: SELECT DISTINCT ?x0 WHERE {\\n?x0 ns:film.film.distributors/ns:film.film_film_distributor_relationship.distributor M0 .\\n?x0 ns:film.film.produced_by|ns:film.film.production_companies ?x1 .\\n?x1 a ns:film.film_art_director .\\n?x1 ns:people.person.nationality ns:m.0d05w3\\n} Question: Was M1 produced by M3 , distributed by M2 , and distributed by a film director","target":"0","rationale":"The answer is 0 because the query is selecting all the films that are produced by a film director, distributed by M2 and M3.

A week later, his business partnership with the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas dissolved amid reports of the casino's refusal to agree to Martin's request to perform only once a night. He was taken by the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, where he was the featured performer on the hotel's opening night December 23, 1973, and also signed a three-picture deal with MGM Studios. Less than a month after his second marriage had dissolved, Martin married 26-year-old Catherine Hawn, on April 25, 1973. Hawn had been the receptionist at the chic Gene Shacrove hair salon in Beverly Hills. They divorced November 10, 1976. He was also briefly engaged to Gail Renshaw, Miss World-U.S.A. 1969. Eventually, Martin reconciled with Jeanne, though they never remarried.  He also made a public reconciliation with Lewis on the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon in 1976. Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Martin out on stage. As Martin and Lewis embraced, the audience cheered and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years. Lewis reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, \\"So, you working?\\" Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was \\"at the Meggum\\" (meaning the MGM Grand). This, with the death of Martin's son Dean Paul Martin more than a decade later, helped bring the two men together. They maintained a quiet friendship, but only performed again once, in 1989, on Martin's 72nd birthday.\\nQuestion: Did he release any more music?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"\\"L.A.

The town is an administrative district , with a Town Council .\\n\\n- A protectorate, in its inception adopted by modern international law, is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.\\n\\n- Gaborone is situated between Kgale and Oodi Hills, on the Notwane River in the south-eastern corner of Botswana, and from the South African border.

In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.\\n\\n- In the Netherlands and Belgium, the mayor (or ) is an appointed government position, whose main responsibility is chairing the executive and legislative councils of a municipality.

Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states.

Passage:Five youth team players were given professional contracts for the 2015–16 season: defender Lewis Bergin, midfielders Chekaine Steele, Billy Reeves and Omar Haughton, and striker Jonathon Kapend. Manager Rob Page signed a new two-year contract in May 2015. However he needed to avoid a poor start to the season as chairman Norman Smurthwaite warned he was prepared to make \\"ruthless decisions\\" if the club were struggling by September. The first signings of the season were powerful former loanee defender Remie Streete from Newcastle United, and former Norwich City youth player Sam Kelly. Midfielder Sam Foley also joined the \\"Valiants\\" on a two-year contract, choosing to leave relegated Yeovil Town just after picking up Yeovil's Player of the Year award. Page further strengthened the defence and midfield by signing Walsall right-back Ben Purkiss and Crewe Alexandra defensive midfielder Anthony Grant. Page needed to find a cost effective forward with the club both short on strikers following the departure of Tom Pope and Ben Williamson and with little funds available due to a large cut to the wage bill, and so brought in young Watford striker Uche Ikpeazu on loan, having been impressed by Ikpeazu's performances for Crewe last season. Another former Crewe favourite, A-Jay Leitch-Smith, was also signed after impressing Page during pre-season. The eighth and final summer signing was Ryan Inniss, who was confirmed as joining on a season long loan from Crystal Palace after being linked with a return to Vale Park for many weeks. On 6 August, Vale signed goalkeeper Jak Alnwick on a short-term deal; he was signed to compete with Sam Johnson for a first team place as Chris Neal was out injured at the start of the season.","target":"b","rationale":"The only proper noun in the passage is 'Rob Page' and there is no information about how old he was when he signed a new two-year contract."},{"source":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who performed a tribute?\\n\\nAmidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.\\nFrom the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.\\n\\n- The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.\\n\\n- The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.\\n\\n- Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces, police, intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex.\\n\\n- A field officer, field grade officer, or senior officer is an army, marine, or air force commissioned officer senior in rank to a company officer but junior to a general officer. In most armies this corresponds to the ranks of major, lieutenant colonel and colonel, or their equivalents. Some countries also include brigadier in the definition.\\n\\n- The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.\\n\\n- The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large.\\n\\n- Major is a military rank of commissioned officer status, with corresponding ranks existing in many military forces throughout the world. When used unhyphenated, in conjunction with no other indicators, Major is one rank senior to that of an army Captain, and one rank subordinate or below the rank of Lieutenant colonel. It is considered the most junior of the field officer ranks.\\n\\n- Thomas Buchanan McGuire , Jr. ( August 1 , 1920 -- January 7 , 1945 ) was a United States Army major who was killed in action while serving as a member of the Army Air Forces during World War II and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . He was one of the most decorated American fighter pilots and the second highest scoring American ace of the war . McGuire was memorialized by the renaming of Fort Dix Army Air Force Base in Burlington County , New Jersey , to McGuire Air Force Base in 1948 .\\n\\n- The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War.

In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include other branches of the military such as the air force via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army.

The Army, or Armies of the United States includes: the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve, (as well as any volunteer or conscripted forces). \\n\\n- The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.\\n\\n- A fighter pilot is a military aviator trained to engage in air-to-air combat while in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft.

With magazines, I was always a little suspicious that the review wasn't true, that it was more an advertorial than an honest article. Blogs seemed more honest - I never distrusted the review. Plus they went into so much more depth than magazines ever did. I think that the day I discovered beauty blogs was probably also the day my magazine addiction came to an end.\\nBUT, there is one issue that I do have with blogs and that is editing, or grammar to be more precise. Now, don't get me wrong, it is not all blogs that I have this issue with. In fact, the majority of blogs I do read are very well written. But, I still come across a few that don't know the difference between your & you're; where, we're & were; and their, there & they're and this is a massive pet hate of mine. The odd typo doesn't bother me. We all make them. I know I do as I usually only proof read once but repeatedly writing there instead of their or where instead of were drives me mental.

I ask that everyone is honest with me here, as I would really like to resolve this issue and obviously if I did something wrong I should apologise. I could really use some objective third party advice here.\\n\\nMy bf, D (23M) and I (21F), and I have a friend, S (20F). She is his best friend and they dated briefly almost 2 years ago but decided they are better as friends. I want to preface all of this by saying she is absolutely not the problem. She is always very respectful of our relationship and I think she is a good friend for D. They have known each other for about three years. \\n\\nWhen D introduced us, we instantly got along. I knew about her through the grapevine already before I even met D and I had a little bit of a girl crush on her. She's beautiful and very sweet, a literal angel. I love her to death and am very protective over her.\\n\\nD and S had irreconcilable differences that made it clear they are not good together for a relationship. I have never had even an inkling of doubt that he would cheat on me or still has feelings for her or anything. She was the last person he dated before me and it's been a long time since then. I don't want anyone thinking this issue has something to do with him having feelings for her or anything like that. Trust me, I have been cheated on multiple times and know the signs and gut feelings and all of that. \\n\\nAlso, for the most part, me and D have a great relationship. We're both child-free, have been together for almost a year and he was my best friend for a year before that. We live together in a very cute one bedroom apartment which me moved into recently in December. We split everything 50/50, I go to school full time for Finance and work at a very prestigious country club in our area, and he is a professional musician. We both make good money and support ourselves (I do get a little bit of help from my mom with paying for school and medical stuff and the like since I'm unable to work full time during school). I am very happy with him and generally enjoy our relationship.\\n\\nWe do however have our issues like every other couple. The main one is communication which we try to work on every day. I try to work on keeping my tone calm and not yelling and also bringing things up at appropriate times, and he works on not shutting down and getting mean and aggressive. One of the arguments we had recently ended with him telling me he wanted me to be more direct about what I want and just coming out and saying it instead of hinting or beating around the bush.\\n\\nThe other night we hung out with S for the first time in a few months. She is very busy and although they talk for an hour or so once a week-ish on the phone, neither of us see her very often. I text Snapchat and call her regularly as well and consider her a close friend. We went to Starbucks and got coffee. Immediately, I guess D could see something was wrong with her, and started asking her repeatedly to tell him. I could tell she didn't want to talk about it and kept trying to change the subject and hoping he would get the hint. She told him over and over again that she didn't want to talk about it, it wasn't a big deal, etc. and I was starting to feel VERY awkward and uncomfortable being in the middle of this situation and was getting quite anxious (I have chronic anxiety that I have seen a therapist for).\\n\\nWhen she went to take a bathroom break I decided to do what he asked the last time we argued and be honest and direct. I told him I know he means well and isn't trying to be an ass but he is putting both of us in a really uncomfortable position by continuing to ask her what's wrong. She probably doesn't want to talk about it in a public place and he could always talk to her about it privately. She'll talk to him when she's ready, all that stuff. I didn't even make it about myself and my feelings, because I didn't think that was as important as there not being weirdness between the two of them, and that was the only source of my discomfort, so if that was resolved I'd be okay. \\n\\nThroughout the conversation he was being extremely argumentative and snappy saying he knows her better than me and that he knows if he just coaxes it out of her she'll tell him. He was upset that she picked a Starbucks because they wouldn't be able to talk there. I told him she likely picked the location on purpose because she wanted to just be chill today and not get into heavy stuff since it was the first time they'd gotten to hang out in a while. He got very angry when I said this and said he didn't ask for my advice, he's known her longer than me, and I'm butting in where it's not my place. \\n\\nHe was quiet and moody the rest of the night and when we headed home he was silent. I brought it up again in the car because I felt the issue was unresolved and didn't want us to go to bed without fully discussing it. We argued the whole way home and he stood his ground that I should have basically sucked it up and not said anything because she's mainly his friend and he knows her better. I didn't understand why he was upset since I was doing what he asked by being honest and direct without being mean.\\n\\nSo honestly, am I the asshole here? I know people shouldn't give unsolicited advice and believe in the \\"nobody asked\\" rule. I don't like people giving me unsolicited advice and although I typically try to refrain from doing so (unless I think it's absolutely necessary, i.e. I think a person is actively going to ruin their life or get hurt or something if I don't give them advice) I thought since this situation involved me and I kind of had to sit there and feel uncomfortable by all of it, and I didn't think it was fair for him to put S or me in that situation, I had a right to say something.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThanks in advance for any advice; it's all appreciated!

Otherwise, the haruspex tells him, the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods. In a prayer recorded by Livy, Decius commits himself and the enemy to the dii Manes and Tellus, charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks, and is killed; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering.

Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\\nThat’s right, you STOP!\\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\\nThis isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators.

They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land.

Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the...\\nHow many people were stabbed on the flight? \\nI was going to say \\"Three\\".

A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25.\\n\\nIdentified as a future Test prospect, he was selected in a Western Australia Combined XI for a match against the touring England cricket team at the start of the 1958-59 season in Perth. Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.  He scored 85 against Western Australia and then made 84 not out for New South Wales against England. He was selected for an Australian XI, which played the tourists in a dress rehearsal before the Tests. He made one and two as Australia were crushed by 345 runs.  Nevertheless, O'Neill was selected to make his debut in the five-Test series against England, playing in all of the matches. The First Test in Brisbane was a low scoring match described by Australian captain Richie Benaud as producing \\"some of the slowest and worst cricket imaginable\\", O'Neill made 34 in Australia's first innings of 186 to help secure a lead of 52. He then top-scored with an unbeaten 71 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory. O'Neill scored 71 of the last 89 runs scored while he was at the crease, refusing to be dried up by the England's usage of leg theory. It enlivened a match plagued by time-wasting, and best remembered for a depressingly slow innings by England's Trevor Bailey, who scored 68 from 426 balls in seven and a half hours. England captain Peter May described O'Neill's innings as \\"sparkling\\" and said that it made \\"everything which had gone before look even more wretched\\". Retired English player Ian Peebles, writing in the Sunday Times, said \\"Although O'Neill is in the very early stages of his career, it is already something of an occasion when he comes to the wicket, and one can sense the expectancy of the crowd and the heightened tension of the opposition\\". Wisden opined that O'Neill had \\"saved a game that had been tortuous for days\\". For his part, O'Neill said that the dour play was \\"unbelievable\\" and that he was \\"just about falling to sleep\\" in the field.  He struck 77 in the rain-affected drawn Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and followed this with 56 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Despite making a duck in the Fifth Test, he ended the series as the second highest runscorer with 282 at 56.40 as Australia took the series 4-0. He bowled two overs without success. Outside the Tests, O'Neill scored 155 and 128 against Victoria and Western Australia respectively as New South Wales completed their sixth successive Sheffield Shield win.\\n\\nWhat was his highest score?","target":"282","rationale":"In the given passage, there is a description about Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill's career in cricket.

This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.

This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints.

But the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, and both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims. In 1750, Christopher Gist explored the Ohio territory, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, and he opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown. He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians agreed to terms through their \\"Half-King\\" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative. These terms included permission to build a strong house at the mouth of the Monongahela River on the modern site of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. By the late 17th century, the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley, and they laid claim to it as their hunting ground by right of conquest. The War of the Austrian Succession  formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe. The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies were turned over to a commission, but it reached no decision.

The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China.

Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.\\n\\n- The Sony Center is a JAHN designed Sony - sponsored building complex located at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin , Germany .

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex. \\nBased on the previous passage, What two states is Child celebrating her 90th birthday with fans or family members? \\nIs \\"South Carolina\\" a correct answer?","target":"No","rationale":"The context of the passage is Julia Child's 90th birthday celebration.

These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.\\n\\n- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- An ascospore is a spore contained in an ascus or that was produced inside an ascus. This kind of spore is specific to fungi classified as ascomycetes (Ascomycota).\\n\\n- \\nIn formal nomenclature.\\nWhen formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, stipulates that \\"species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations\\", but ranks higher than the genus may be assigned \\"incertae sedis\\".\\n\\n- The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- An ascus (plural asci; from Greek  \\"skós\\" 'skin bag') is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in ascomycete fungi. Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division. However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. \\"Monosporascus cannonballus\\"), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. \\"Tympanis\\") with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some \\"Cordyceps\\", also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus, refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the \\"bourrelet\\" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus).\\n\\n- Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Clypeolum is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum . The relationship of this taxon to other taxa within the class is unknown ( incertae sedis ) , and it has not yet been placed with certainty into any class , order , or family .\\n\\n- Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: (\\"askos\\"), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences.\\n\\n- Dikarya is a subkingdom of Fungi that includes the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, both of which in general produce dikaryons, may be filamentous or unicellular, but are always without flagella. The Dikarya are most of the so-called \\"higher fungi\\", but also include many anamorphic species that would have been classified as molds in historical literature. Phylogenetically the two phyla regularly group together. In a 1998 publication, Thomas Cavalier-Smith referred to this group as the Neomycota.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'ascomycetes'.","target":"clypeolum","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"clypeolum\\""},{"source":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A woman, Sara, is being chased through the snows of Norway. She is ultimately cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II Nazi SS uniforms.\\nSeven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream. Meanwhile, the hiker has set up camp in the mountains and is eating dinner when he is disturbed by a noise outside. He investigates, and is attacked and killed by a zombie.\\nThe next morning, Vegard, out looking for Sara, discovers the hiker's body. He searches the area, falls through the snow into a cave, and is knocked unconscious. After sunset, Erlend finds an old wooden box filled with valuables and golden trinkets. They celebrate, and one of them pockets a gold coin. They eventually return the rest of the treasure to the box. Erlend goes to the outhouse where he and Chris have sex. Afterwards, Erlend return to the cabin, and drops a gold coin. Chris is attacked by a zombie, and killed. The others leave the cabin to look for her, and find Sara's rucksack buried in the snow.\\nUpon returning to the cabin, they are attacked. Erlend is killed in an attempt...","target":"Dead Snow","rationale":"The movie plot provided is from a 2009 Norwegian horror film called \\"Dead Snow\\". The word 'dead' in the title describes that the zombies are dead and no longer alive, which aligns with the context of Sara being eaten by them.

Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.\\n\\nParagraph: Stephanie is a nurse at the local high school.

This was essential for the platinum printing that he preferred early in his career, since at that time the platinum papers required ultra-violet light to activate. Weston did not have an artificial ultra-violet light source, so he had to place the contact print directly in sunlight in order to expose it. This limited him to printing only on sunny days.  When he wanted a print that was larger than the original negative size, he used an enlarger to create a larger inter-positive, then contact printed it to a new negative. The new larger negative was then used to make a print of that size. This process was very labor-intensive; he once wrote in his Daybooks \\"I am utterly exhausted tonight after a whole day in the darkroom, making eight contact negatives from the enlarged positives.\\"  In 1924 Weston wrote this about his darkroom process, \\"I have returned, after several years use of Metol-Hydroquinine open-tank\\" developer to a three-solution Pyro developer, and I develop one at a time in a tray instead of a dozen in a tank.\\" Each sheet of film was viewed under either a green or an orange safelight in his darkroom, allowing him to control the individual development of a negative.

They would score first as Ben Roethlisberger found Emmanuel Sanders on a 5-yard pass for a 7-0 lead.  The Dolphins managed to get on the board as Caleb Sturgis kicked a 30-yard field goal making the score 7-3.  In the 2nd quarter, Charles Clay caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Ryan Tannehill as the Phins took the lead 10-7 at halftime.  After the break, the Dolphins went right back to work as Daniel Thomas ran for a 4-yard touchdown making the score 17-7.  The Steelers then came within 3 when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 43-yard touchdown pass making the score 17-14 and would eventually score again when Troy Polamalu picked off Tannehill and returned it 19 yards for a touchdown as they retook the lead 21-17.  The Dolphins however moved back into the lead as Tannehill found Brian Hartline on a 4-yard pass for a 24-21 score.  In the 4th quarter, Roethlisberger found Jerricho Cotchery on a 16-yard touchdown pass as they moved ahead 28-24.  Clay then caught a pass from Tannehill making the score 31-28 as the Dolphins retook the lead.  They would stop scoring after Sturgis kicked a 27-yard field goal for a 34-28 lead.  Under a minute to go in the quarter, the Steelers got the ball back with Roethlisberger throwing to Brown and then Brown running for what seemed to be the game-tying (and eventually game-winning touchdown and PAT), but officials reviewed the play and it was determined that Brown had stepped out of bounds during the run ending the game dropping the team to 5-8.\\n\\nHow many yards of differential separated the longest passing touchdowns and the longest defensive touchdown?","target":"24","rationale":"The longest passing touchdowns for the Steelers were 43 yards and 16 yards.

The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians Jan Karel van den Broek and J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry and photography. Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.On his arrival in Japan, Rossier presumably introduced himself as a photographer despatched to Japan by Negretti and Zambra, perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception, for while he remained in the country he was often referred to as an \\"English\\" photographer.
