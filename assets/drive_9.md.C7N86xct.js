Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: Set in the Australian outback in the 1880s, the movie follows the series of events following the horrific rape and murder of the Hopkins family, allegedly committed by the infamous Burns brothers gang.The film opens in a brothel during a violent gunfight between the police and Charlie Burns' (Guy Pearce) gang, which ends with the deaths of all of the gang members except for Charlie and his younger brother Mikey. Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) proposes to Charlie: he and Mikey can go free of the crimes they have committed if Charlie kills his older brother, Arthur (Danny Huston). Arthur is a mercurial psychopath who has become something of a legend and is so vicious that the Aboriginal tribes refer to him as \\"The Dog Man\\" and both the police and the Aboriginals refuse to go near his camp. Captain Stanley muses that perhaps the bounty hunters will kill Arthur in time and then states his intention to civilize the harsh Australian wilderness by bringing Arthur to justice and using Mikey as leverage. Charlie has nine days to find and kill Arthur, or else Mikey will be hanged from the gallows on Christmas Day.We discover why Captain Stanley is intent on taming Australia: he has been forced to move there with his delicate wife, Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and apparently wants to make it an appropriate place for them to live. The Stanleys were also friends of the Hopkins family, leading Martha to have nightmares about her dead friends and the unborn child one of them is revealed to have carried. Word spreads of Stanley's deal with Charlie, primarily from Stanley's corrupt subordinate, Sergeant Lawrence (Robert Morgan), causing disgust among the townspeople.Shortly thereafter, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), for whom Captain Stanley works, orders that Mikey be given one hundred lashes as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes that Mikey is innocent and the flogging will surely kill him, but because it would also break his deal with Charlie and thus put him and his wife in grave danger. Stanley sends Sergeant Lawrence away with tracker Jacko (David Gulpillil) and other men to \\"investigate\\" the reported slaying of Dan O'Riley by a group of Aborigines. Captain Stanley attempts to defend Mikey by gunpoint from the bloodthirsty townspeople, but is overruled once Martha arrives, insisting on revenge for her dead friends. Mikey is then brutally flogged, and horrifically wounded. The formerly excited townspeople slowly become disgusted and Martha faints at the ghastly display. After 40 lashes, Mikey has collapsed and the whip is soaked with blood. Captain Stanley grabs the whip and throws it at Fletcher, staining his face and suit with blood, who in turn fires Stanley.Meanwhile, Charlie rides a great distance in search of Arthur, drinking and apparently reflecting on what he will do. Along the way, he encounters an inebriated old man named Jellon Lamb (John Hurt). In the course of conversation, Charlie realizes that Lamb is a bounty hunter in pursuit of the Burns brothers and knocks him out. Later on, after sleeping on a rock bed, Charlie awakes and, before he can gather what's going on, is speared in the chest by a group of Aboriginal men standing over him. Seconds later a gunshot is heard and the head of the man who threw the spear explodes. Charlie then passes out.Charlie wakes up in the camp of his brother Arthur, which is located in caves among desolate mountains. Arthur's gang consists of Samuel Stoat (Tom Budge), who shot the Aboriginal man who had speared Charlie; a woman named Queenie (Leah Purcell) who tends to Charlie's wound; and a muscular Aboriginal man called Two-Bob (Tom E. Lewis). As he recovers from his wounds, Charlie has several opportunities to kill his brother, but does not. Not too far away from Arthur's camp, Sergeant Lawrence and his men have found and butchered a group of Aborigines. Arthur and Two-Bob find Lawrence's group while they sleep, ostensibly to get a horse for Charlie, and proceed to kill Jacko and Sergeant Lawrence.

In 1911, the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the Brussels Indépendants. The following year, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote and published Du \\"Cubisme\\" in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of Cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 Salon des Indépendants and the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris). Clarifying their aims as artists, this work was the first theoretical treatise on Cubism and it still remains the clearest and most intelligible. The result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in Puteaux and Courbevoie. It mirrored the attitudes of the \\"artists of Passy\\", which included Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication. The concept developed in Du \\"Cubisme\\" of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the Cubists.;\\nQuestion: What year did the term Cubism become used more?;\\nIf you can't find the answer, please respond \\"unanswerable\\".\\nAnswer:","target":"1911","rationale":"The context states that the term Cubism was used in 1911 by poets and critics with reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, and Léger.

It was the first start for quarterback Brock Osweiler, substituting for the injured Peyton Manning. The Broncos grabbed the lead on their initial possession, when Osweiler, playing on his 25th birthday, connected with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 48-yard touchdown pass. The Bears got on the scoreboard in the second quarter, with two field goals by placekicker Robbie Gould &#8212; from 46 and 37 yards out. The Broncos increased their lead to 10-6, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus as time expired in the second half. Midway through the third quarter, Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan intercepted a pass by Bears' quarterback Jay Cutler deep in Bears' territory. Six plays later, the Broncos were attempting to add to their lead on a 4th-and-goal, however, the Bears' defense prevailed after running back Ronnie Hillman was inadvertently tripped by Owseiler on the hand off at the 2-yard line. The Bears then marched down the field, and another 37-yard field goal by Gould narrowed the Broncos' lead to 10-9 near the end of the third quarter. The Broncos then increased their lead to 17-9 early in the fourth quarter, when Osweiler fired a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cody Latimer, who was playing in place of the injured Emmanuel Sanders. The Bears once again marched down the field, and were facing a 4th-and-goal from the Broncos' 4-yard line, however, a pass from Cutler to running back Jeremy Langford was broken up by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib with ten minutes remaining in the game. The Broncos' offense chewed up six minutes of the clock, but were forced to punt, giving the football back to the Bears with 4:23 remaining. On the sixth play of the Bears' next drive, Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a strip sack and fumble off Cutler at the Broncos' 35-yard line, which was recovered by defensive end Malik Jackson with 2:30 remaining. However, the Broncos' offense went three-and-out, though they forced the Bears to burn two of their three team timeouts. Just after the two minute warning, the Bears marched down the field, and finally got into the end zone with only 29 seconds remaining, with Langford lunging for a 2-yard touchdown run. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion running attempt by Langford, which would have tied the game. The Bears' subsequent onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Broncos' offense ran out the clock. NotesThis was the first game this season in which the Broncos' offense did not commit any turnovers. This was Bears' head coach John Fox's first game against the Broncos since mutually parting ways with the Broncos following the end of the 2014 season. It also marked Jay Cutler's first game against the Broncos, who drafted Cutler in the first round of the 2006 draft before he was traded to the Bears prior to the 2009 season.

The variety originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is produced, from England to New Zealand. For new and developing wine regions, growing Chardonnay is seen as a \\"rite of passage\\" and an easy entry into the international wine market.\\n\\n- Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.\\n\\n- Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are \\"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\\". A related United Nations paper adds that \\"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\\".\\n\\n- Centrope is an Interreg IIIA project to establish a multinational region in the Central Europe encompassing four European countries: Slovakia, Austria, Hungary and Czech Republic.\\n\\n- Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and \\"green flavors\\" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risk losing a lot of aromatics from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes.\\n\\n- Cultural identity is the identity or feeling of belonging to a group.

These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.\\n\\n- A varietal wine is a wine made primarily from a single named grape variety, and which typically displays the name of that variety on the wine label. Examples of grape varieties commonly used in varietal wines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Merlot. Wines that display the name of two or more varieties on their label, such as a Chardonnay-Viognier, are blends and not varietal wines. The term is frequently misused in place of vine variety; the term variety refers to the vine or grape while varietal refers to the wine produced by a variety.\\n\\n- White wine is a wine whose color can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold coloured.\\n\\n- Western Europe, also West Europe, is the region comprising the western part of the European continent.

Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines. Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. As of 2004, Riesling was estimated to be the world's 20th most grown variety at (with an increasing trend), but in terms of importance for quality wines, it is usually included in the \\"top three\\" white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc.

The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial.  He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in..., what would be the answer ?","target":"Messiaen","rationale":"Messiaen was the name of a composer who died in 1992.

Invited by Prime Minister Venizelos in 1910, the mission began its work upon its arrival in May 1911. Granted extraordinary powers and led by Vice Admiral Lionel Grand Tufnell, it thoroughly reorganized the Navy Ministry and dramatically improved the number and quality of exercises in gunnery and fleet maneuvers. In 1912, the core unit of the fleet was the fast armoured cruiser Georgios Averof, completed in 1910 and, at that time, the fastest and most modern warship in the combatant navies. It was complemented by three rather antiquated battleships of the Hydra class. There were also eight destroyers built in 1906-1907, and six new destroyers that were hastily bought in summer 1912 as the imminence of war became apparent. Nevertheless, at the outbreak of the war, the Greek fleet was far from ready. The Ottoman battlefleet retained a clear advantage in number of ships, speed of the main surface units and, more importantly, in the number and caliber of the ships' guns. In addition, as the war caught the fleet in the middle of its expansion and reorganization, fully a third of the fleet  only reached Greece after hostilities had started, forcing the navy to reshuffle crews, who consequently suffered from lacking familiarization and training time. Coal stockpiles and other war stores were also in short supply, while the Georgios Averof had arrived with barely any ammunition, and would remain so until late November.\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: How many destroyers did the Greek Navy have in total by 1912?","target":"14","rationale":"To answer the question \\"How many destroyers did the Greek Navy have in total by 1912?\\", we need to calculate how many old and new ships were there.

The event has been famously labelled a \\"postmodern coup\\" by the Turkish admiral Salim Dervişoğlu. Shortly thereafter, the Welfare Party (RP) was banned and reborn as the Virtue Party (FP). A new government was formed by ANAP and Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP) supported from the outside by the center-left Republican People's Party (CHP), led by Deniz Baykal. The DSP became the largest parliamentary party in the 1999 elections. Second place went to the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). These two parties, alongside Yılmaz's ANAP formed a government. The government was somewhat effective, if not harmonious, bringing about much-needed economic reform, instituting human rights legislation, and bringing Turkey ever closer to the European Union.\\n Passage 2:In times past, the ancient city of Limerick itself was entirely contained in the area now known as Englishtown as a walled city. The Vikings established the city in this area following the Viking Invasion of Ireland. After the Norman Invasion of Ireland, the city was taken by Norman or Old English settlers. It is from this time that the area became referred to as Englishtown and also to distinguish it from Irishtown south of the Abbey River which was populated by native Irish. It was during the Norman Conquest that many of the city's landmarks were built in this district such as the 13th century King John's Castle and the 800-year-old St Mary's Cathedral. Nicholas Street and Mary Street on the island formed the medieval city centre of Limerick and are perhaps the oldest streets in the city. Samuel Lewis writing in 1837 in his Topographical Dictionary of Ireland describes Limerick's old city of Englishtown as resembling the city of Rouen, Normandy with the housing built in Flemish fashion. Even by then though there is evidence the district was in decline as he describes the area as exhibiting a 'dirty & neglected appearance'. Following the development of Newtown Pery the city centre shifted south to the present day centre of the city and the Englishtown area lost its position as the fashionable area of the city. By the late 18th Century the old continental style cramped lofty Dutch & Flemish houses that once characterised the area were transformed into tenements and rented to Limerick's poorest. Englishtown became characterised by poverty, slum living and squalor. All of the slums were cleared in the early to mid 20th Century, resulting in the loss of most of the areas historical built heritage such as the collection of Flemish townhouses, Ireton's Castle, the Exchange building, the Tholsel amongst much more. Unfortunately many buildings and shops in the area remain derelict or in deteriorating conditions today.\\n Passage 3:Peaky Blinders is a gangster family epic set in Birmingham, England in 1919, several months after the end of the First World War in November 1918.

The gang comes to the attention of Chief Inspector Major Chester Campbell (Sam Neill), a detective in the Royal Irish Constabulary sent over by Winston Churchill from Belfast, where he had been sent to clean up the city of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Communists, gangs and common criminals. Winston Churchill (played by Andy Nyman in Series 1 and Richard McCabe in Series 2) charged him with suppressing disorder and uprising in Birmingham and recovering a stolen cache of arms meant to be shipped to Libya.

As a myotube is formed from many different myoblast cells, it contains many nuclei, but has a continuous cytoplasm. This is why skeletal muscle cells are multinucleate, as the nucleus of each contributing myoblast remains intact in the mature skeletal muscle cell. However, cardiac and smooth muscle cells are not multinucleate because the myoblasts that form their cells do not fuse. Gap junctions develop in the cardiac and single-unit smooth muscle in the early stages of development. In skeletal muscles, ACh receptors are initially present along most of the surface of the myoblasts, but spinal nerve innervation causes the release of growth factors that stimulate the formation of motor end-plates and NMJs. As neurons become active, electrical signals that are sent through the muscle influence the distribution of slow and fast fibers in the muscle. Although the number of muscle cells is set during development, satellite cells help to repair skeletal muscle cells. A satellite cell is similar to a myoblast because it is a type of stem cell; however, satellite cells are incorporated into muscle cells and facilitate the protein synthesis required for repair and growth. These cells are located outside the sarcolemma and are stimulated to grow and fuse with muscle cells by growth factors that are released by muscle fibers under certain forms of stress. Satellite cells can regenerate muscle fibers to a very limited extent, but they primarily help to repair damage in living cells. If a cell is damaged to a greater extent than can be repaired by satellite cells, the muscle fibers are replaced by scar tissue in a process called fibrosis. Because scar tissue cannot contract, muscle that has sustained significant damage loses strength and cannot produce the same amount of power or endurance as it could before being damaged. Smooth muscle tissue can regenerate from a type of stem cell called a pericyte, which is found in some small blood vessels. Pericytes allow smooth muscle cells to regenerate and repair much...\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- nucleus\\n\\n- mucus\\n\\n- cerebellum\\n\\n- cytoplasm\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"cytoplasm","rationale":"In this question, the answer is cytoplasm. \\nHere's our rationale: \\"The myotube has many nuclei but a continuous cytoplasm\\"."},{"source":"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Boys may soon be able to get Gardasil, the vaccine given to girls and young women to prevent infection by four types of human papillomavirus.

Passage:Hanoi Rocks released their first album in 1981 titled Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks, with eight out of ten tracks written by McCoy. The album was produced by Andy McCoy and Michael Monroe who were known as \\"The Muddy Twins\\". In 1982 Hanoi Rocks recorded and released their second studio album Oriental Beat in London. The original cover's back side featured Andy McCoy's then girlfriend Anna's naked breasts painted blue and red with \\"Hanoi Roxx\\" written across it. After the album's release, the band moved to London the same year, and subsequently fired drummer Gyp Casino before hiring Hanoi Rocks fan Nicholas Dingley, better known as Razzle, as drummer. The line-up with Razzle is considered the definitive version of Hanoi Rocks. Later that year the band released Self Destruction Blues, which had Razzle on the cover, but he didn't play on the album, because it was actually a compilation of old singles. The tour for the album took the band to Asia for the first time. The next year 1983, the band released Back to Mystery City and after that, in 1984, the band worked with producer Bob Ezrin, and released Two Steps from the Move. Before this, McCoy had written most of the songs by himself, but for this album Bob Ezrin helped McCoy with the writing, along with Monroe. He also got some help with the lyrics from legendary Ian Hunter (of Mott The Hoople). After Razzle's death, Sam Yaffa left the band due to personal differences with McCoy (amongst other reasons he was now engaged to Anna, McCoy's former girlfriend known from the Oriental Beat cover). The band tried out new members (amongst them The Clash ex-drummer Terry Chimes and bassist René Berg), but things didn't work out, so the band disbanded in 1985.","target":"a","rationale":"The question asks which of the first two albums was more successful and thus requires information from both albums to answer."},{"source":"Sentence: \\"I took a snooze.\\"\\nWould a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- unacceptable\\n- acceptable","target":"acceptable","rationale":"The given sentence is linguistically acceptable because it follows the subject-verb-object structure.

Such methods are appealing for capability on large-scale sparse datasets. On top of that, they are computationally efficient and insensitive to the hyper-parameter settings. In this paper, we present a new framework for adapting Adam-typed methods, namely AdamT. Instead of applying a simple exponential weighted average, AdamT also includes the trend information when updating the parameters with the adaptive step size and gradients. The newly added term is expected to efficiently capture the non-horizontal moving patterns on the cost surface, and thus converge more rapidly. We show empirically the importance of the trend component, where AdamT outperforms the conventional Adam method constantly in both convex and non-convex settings.","target":"We present a new framework for adapting Adam-typed methods, namely AdamT, to include the trend information when updating the parameters with the adaptive step size and gradients","rationale":"We present a new framework for adapting Adam-typed methods, namely AdamT, to include the trend information when updating the parameters with the adaptive step size and gradients."},{"source":"You are given a dialog between 2 or more individuals.

On November 27, 2017, Williams scored a season-high 42 points in a 120–115 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. On December 9, 2017, he hit a go-ahead pull-up 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds remaining, lifting the Clippers to a 113–112 victory over the Washington Wizards. He finished with 35 points to lead a dominant bench effort for the Clippers. On December 31, 2017, he scored 40 points off the bench in a 106–98 win over the Charlotte Hornets. Williams was subsequently named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, December 25 through Sunday, December 31. On January 10, 2018, he scored 27 of his career-high 50 points in the third quarter of the Clippers' 125–106 win over the Golden State Warriors. He shot 16 for 27 with a career-best eight 3-pointers and made all 10 of his free throws. It was the highest scoring effort by any Clipper in a single game since Charles Smith tied a franchise record with 52 points in December 1990. Williams was subsequently named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, January 8 through Sunday, January 14. On January 20, 2018, he recorded 31 points, a franchise-record 10 steals, and seven assists in a 125–113 loss to the Utah Jazz. He became the first player in league history to reach 30 points, 10 steals, and seven assists in a game since steals became a recorded stat. On January 26, 2018, he had 40 points and matched his season high with 10 assists in the Clippers' 109–100 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. On February 7, 2018, he signed a multi-year contract extension with the Clippers. On February 23, 2018, he had 35 points in 33 minutes, including a 23-point second quarter, in a 128–117 win over the Phoenix Suns.

Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.\\n\\nHint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.","target":"Joe","rationale":"In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring. In this case Joe used no-till gardening method that does not disturb the soil by using tools such as ploughs or tilling machines. Soil is only disturbed when planting seeds and harvesting crops. \\nThe paragraph tells us about Kat who applied conventional methods of farming which involves tillage practices like plowing, harrowing etc., so she has less possibility of having a soil that takes longer time to dry in Spring unlike joe who uses the no-till method.\\""},{"source":"Question: \\"Where was the seat of government?\\"\\n\\nContext: \\"By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England.

Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. There are also cases where songs are used in tie in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song. Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these works were described by various terms including \\"illustrated song\\", \\"filmed insert\\", \\"promotional (promo) film\\", \\"promotional clip\\", \\"promotional video\\", \\"song video\\", \\"song clip\\" or \\"film clip\\".

Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.\\n\\n- YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.

Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of medical oncology (the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer).\\n\\n- A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon, interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist involving extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist, and can also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy. When only a sample of tissue is removed with preservation of the histological architecture of the tissues cells, the procedure is called an incisional biopsy or core biopsy. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous and inflammatory conditions.\\n\\n- Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of DNA repair in which the ability to repair damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light is deficient. In extreme cases, \\"all\\" exposure to sunlight must be forbidden, no matter how small; as such, individuals with the disease are often colloquially referred to as \\"Moon child\\". Multiple basal cell carcinomas (basaliomas) and other skin malignancies frequently occur at a young age in those with XP; metastatic malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the two most common causes of death in XP victims. This disease is present in both genders and in all races, with an incidence of 1:250,000 in the United States. XP is roughly six times more common in Japanese people than in other groups.\\n\\n- Ivan Yevhenovych Vyshnevskyi ( Ukrainian :    , Russian :    ; born 21 February 1957 in the village of Chortoryia ( today 's Myrolyubivka , Ternopil Raion ) ; died 11 May 1996 in Dnipropetrovsk of melanoma ) was a Ukrainian footballer . He earned 6 caps for the USSR national football team , making his debut on 25 January 1985 in a friendly against Yugoslavia . He was selected for the UEFA Euro 1988 squad , but did not play in any games at the tournament . He is from the region that once belonged to Winiowiecki family that had estates near Zboriv where the village of Vyshnivets is located .\\n\\n- Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.\\nTobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.\\nMany cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at...\\n\\n- A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys.\\n\\n- Radiation therapy or radiotherapy, often abbreviated RT, RTx, or XRT, is therapy using ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells and normally delivered by a linear accelerator. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology.\\n\\n- Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown.\\nThe primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion.\\nUsing sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down.\\nMelanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women.

In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole.  Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean.\\nThe idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.\\nNansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work.

Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence.

The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a $42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to $180 from $140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay $90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly $2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled $4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed $538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between $700,000 and $1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois.

The army was gradually disintegrating as it continued its retreat westward, offering sometimes fierce but largely unorganized resistance to the advancing Red Army troops. Sporadic fighting continued for several months as the Soviets secured the major cities and towns of eastern Georgia. The Mensheviks entertained hopes of aid from a French naval squadron cruising in the Black Sea off the Georgian coast. On 28 February, the French opened fire on the 31st Rifle Division of the 9th Red Army under V. Chernishev, but did not land troops.

His father had been born in Shenandoah County and moved across the Appalachian Mountains to the Greenbrier County area, but died when Charles was an infant. His paternal grandfather had married a daughter of Joseph Morgan, who helped settle the trans-Appalachian area. His mother, Augusta Delphia Page of Staunton, Virginia, a daughter of Major Charles Page, died in 1844 so Charles and his sister were raised by their uncle, George Moore in Mason County. When Charles was 16, he was sent to Marshall Academy in Huntington, and he would also study with John I Van Meter in Pike County, Pennsylvania, then attend Jefferson College (which later became Washington and Jefferson College) in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products.\\n\\nand the situation: Rob wanted to learn more about collision theory.

At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the...\\nBased on the previous passage, Which passenger made an attempt to stop the hijackers? \\nIs \\"Daniel Lewin\\" a correct answer?","target":"Yes","rationale":"Yes, Daniel Lewin is a correct answer."},{"source":"In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story.

In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.","target":"Patagonian mara","rationale":"The Patagonian mara is a rodent, and raises their young communally in warrens where only the mother nurses her own offspring."},{"source":"I gave my students this multiple choice question: Roger visited his grandfather who lives on a farm.

Described by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC) as \\"the most prestigious and historically significant building in the Conservation Area\\", it is situated in the middle of 70 acres (28 ha) of landscaped parkland featuring lakes, woodland and gardens. Both house and grounds are open to the public and are in one of the 19 conservation areas in the borough.The Swann Lane, Hulme Hall Road, and Hill Top Avenue conservation area contains 16th and 17th century timber-framed buildings, Victorian villas, churches, and some former farmsteads. There are two Grade II listed buildings in this area: Hulme Hall, a timber-framed manor house which dates from either the 16th or 17th century, and 1 Higham Street, formerly Hill Cottage, which is of a similar period and style to Hulme Hall. The Church Inn public house, which dates from either the late 18th or early 19th century, is situated on the edge of this area.\\nAround 300 men from Cheadle Hulme served in the First World War, and it was decided that those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, including a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.Bruntwood Park has a variety of facilities, including orienteering, an 18-hole, par 3 pitch and putt golf course, children's play areas, football pitches, and a BMX track.

This is made possible by the use of optimal transport, which allows us to build these associated estimates while harnessing the underlying geometry of the ground space. Our method gives a novel perspective for building rich and powerful feature representations that simultaneously capture uncertainty (via a distributional estimate) and interpretability (with the optimal transport map). As a guiding example, we formulate unsupervised representations for text, in particular for sentence representation and entailment detection. Empirical results show strong advantages gained through the proposed framework.

Aberrant expression of a HOX-gene dominated stem-cell signature in glioblastoma has been linked with increased resistance to chemo-radiotherapy and sustained proliferation of glioma initiating cells. Here we describe the epigenetic and genetic alterations and their interactions associated with the expression of this signature in glioblastoma.   \\n RESULTS We observe prominent hypermethylation of the HOXA locus 7p15.2 in glioblastoma in contrast to non-tumoral brain. Hypermethylation is associated with a gain of chromosome 7, a hallmark of glioblastoma, and may compensate for tumor-driven enhanced gene dosage as a rescue mechanism by preventing undue gene expression. We identify the CpG island of the HOXA10 alternative promoter that appears to escape hypermethylation in the HOX-high glioblastoma. An additive effect of gene copy gain at 7p15.2 and DNA methylation at key regulatory CpGs in HOXA10 is significantly associated with HOX-signature expression. Additionally, we show concordance between methylation status and presence of active or inactive chromatin marks in glioblastoma-derived spheres that are HOX-high or HOX-low, respectively.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, we propose co-evolution and interaction between gene copy gain, associated with a gain of chromosome 7, and additional epigenetic alterations as key mechanisms triggering a coordinated, but inappropriate, HOX transcriptional program in glioblastoma.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the background of the study (\\"BACKGROUND HOX genes are a family of developmental genes that are expressed neither in the developing forebrain nor in the normal brain.

The story starts when Patel's family decide to move to Canada, along with their zoo animals for their new home.\\nHowever, because of the bad weather, the ship sinks. Pi along with an orangutan  , an injured zebra, a hyena   and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker are the only survivors who take shelter in a small lifeboat. Both the injured zebra and the orangutan are soon killed and eaten by the hyena. The tiger in turn kills and eats the hyena, leaving just the two of them alone on the boat now.\\nIn an effort to avoid being eaten by Richard Parker, Pi acts himself as the head of the group and remains safe from harm. Since he does not want the tiger to die for fear of going mad by being alone on the boat, he fishes and feeds the two of them in order to stay alive.\\nThe life of Pi then enters its third stage when their lifeboat washes up on the shores of Mexico and the tiger escapes into a nearby forest leaving Pi alone. After the Mexicans refuse to believe Pi's story, he changes his tale by replacing the animals with his mother, a cook and a sailor and asks the Mexicans which one they prefer. They prefer hearing the first story though they do not believe a word of it.\\nIn my view, Life of Pi is a must read book for all those who love reading.\\nQuestion: What happens after Pi arrives in Mexico?\\nOptions: A: The tiger dies.\\nB: He tries to escape.\\nC: The Mexicans feel sorry for him.\\nD: The Mexicans doubt his experience.","target":"D","rationale":"In the story, when Pi arrives in Mexico and tells his tale of survival to some local people there, they do not believe a word about it.

Serotonin evoked a dose-dependent and reversible contraction of the detrusor. The reverse response was triggered in trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle--a dose-dependent and reversible relaxation. The maximum amplitude of this relaxation was 85 +/- 15% of the relaxation produced by electrical nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was unaltered by blockade of ganglia, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, cholinergic receptors and prostaglandin synthesis. The serotonin antagonists ketanserin, methysergide and cyproheptadine partly inhibited the effect of serotonin. The antagonism differed in potency on strips of different origin. The antagonists were ineffective or minimally effective in blocking responses to nerve stimulation. The effect of serotonin was probably mediated by specific serotonin receptors different from the serotonin-S2-receptors predominating in vascular smooth muscle.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496).

It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

My mom tried to leave him when I was very young but went back to him because he started winning the custody battle over me. For this reason, I think my mom resents me as the reason she was stuck with an abusive man.\\n\\nWhen I was a kid, my dad would abuse me and my mom would tell me it was my fault for not making a bigger effort to get along with him and obey him. I grew up thinking I was a bad person, because of this and because she was often irrationally cold and angry with me in a way she wasn’t to my siblings. When I was a teenager, I had some major health problems that made it hard for me to take care of myself. My mom was constantly angry and cruel to me during that 3 year period. I ended up in an abusive relationship with someone who raped me, and I couldn’t tell my mom about it because she was more interested in yelling at me for “having bad judgment” for dating this person. I moved out after being kicked out of the house temporarily. \\n\\nAfter I moved my dad turned some of his abuse on my younger brother, who I have always felt my mom favored over my sister and I. He threatened to kick my brother out of the house, so my mom left him. My dad made the divorce very difficult for her, going on a meth bender and losing his job (she had been a stay at home mom for years) so she would have to lose her house and alimony. My mom has understandably been a wreck since.\\n\\nI recently confronted my mom about the way she’s always treated me, since she asked if I was angry at her and I felt I owed her the truth. She told me that she felt trapped, that staying with her abuser was hard for her but she did it so we wouldn’t end up homeless, and that she always took his side because he would treat her worse if he thought she was undermining him in front of the kid (me). She said she was cruel to me for years because she was under a lot of stress - her brother committed suicide, her mom for Alzheimer’s and she had to fight her mom’s husband’s family over her care, and she lost her support system (she had previously homeschooled my siblings and I and now she didn’t so didn’t see the same moms). She said her hand was forced to leave my dad because he wanted to kick my brother out of the house, and she would’ve done the same if he tried to kick me out (she doesn’t remember that SHE kicked me out because she was on drugs at the time and is in denial). She says she just wants a closer relationship since I’m mentally ill and she’s worried about me.\\n\\nAITA for still being mad at her? I honestly feel she could’ve done more and is in denial about her real reasons for leaving. She claims to hate my dad but still keeps in contact with him despite him being a meth addict and trying to throw my sister off the side of the highway the last time any of us saw him. Even if she is being honest, I would rather have been homeless than lived with my dad. And this is petty, but I’m also mad that she’s sad about her brother. He molested me when I was young.

Unbeknownst to Johnny, Joe has been holding him back from his dream: playing in the legitimate pro tour.  When Johnny finally learns that Joe intercepted and threw away an invitation for Johnny to join the pro tour, he breaks from Joe, throwing a game with a large pot.  Losing both that stake money and his hustler income source sparks Joe to violence, and he breaks Johnny's bridge hand outside the pool hall (an homage to a similar scene in the classic pool film The Hustler).  Joe is later beaten up by some of Johnny's friends as a warning to leave him alone.\\nAfter an ultimatum from his girlfriend Tara, Johnny largely leaves the world of pool hustling, and finally commits to a \\"real\\" job in the construction business, but is soon miserable there.

The killer's identity remains unknown. The Zodiac murdered victims in Benicia, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa, and San Francisco between December 1968 and October 1969. Four men and three women between the ages of 16 and 29 were targeted. The killer originated the name \\"Zodiac\\" in a series of taunting letters sent to the local Bay Area press. These letters included four cryptograms (or ciphers). Of the four cryptograms sent, only one has been definitively solved.\\n\\n- Lake Berryessa is the largest lake in Napa County, California.

It was among the most highly rated programs during its run.  Benny's long radio career began on April 6, 1932, when the NBC Commercial Program Department auditioned him for the N.W. Ayer agency and their client, Canada Dry, after which Bertha Brainard, head of the division, said, \\"We think Mr. Benny is excellent for radio and, while the audition was unassisted as far as orchestra was concerned, we believe he would make a great bet for an air program.\\" Recalling the experience in 1956, Benny said Ed Sullivan had invited him to guest on his program (1932), and \\"the agency for Canada Dry ginger ale heard me and offered me a job.\\"  With Canada Dry ginger ale as a sponsor, Benny came to radio on The Canada Dry Program, on May 2, 1932, on the NBC Blue Network and continuing for six months until October 26, moving to CBS on October 30. With Ted Weems leading the band, Benny stayed on CBS until January 26, 1933.  Arriving at NBC on March 17, Benny did The Chevrolet Program until April 1, 1934. He continued with sponsor General Tire through the end of the season. In October, 1934, General Foods, the makers of Jell-O and Grape-Nuts, became the sponsor strongly identified with Benny for 10 years.

I said, \\"Sorry about that that\\" and moved my foot over yet another entire seat. So now there are two entire seats between his body and my seat. I asked him, \\"Does this bother you\\"? He then moved the two seats over and and with both hands flung my foot off of the seat. I will admit that I was angry and in my anger I asked, \\"what the fuck is your problem\\"? Or something similar. I was angry enough that I don't remember. (I've texted my BIL to see if he remembers if any of you care or think it is relevant.) Suffice it to say it wasn't nice whatever is was. He refused to look at me. Now that there was someone sitting in front of me I refrained from putting my feet on the seats. \\n\\nHowever, after that I went from peacefully enjoying opening day with my BIL to being angry. I saw that he was wearing a jersey from the other team so whenever my team did something good I cheered obnoxiously. We were down by a couple runs at that point so there wasn't much to cheer about. For example, loud clapping (more than was necessary) and high fivng the people around us like it was my job. After a half inning he left and did not return. I'm assuming to find better seats. \\n\\nI don't want to mislead you fine people but, before the incident I was sitting in the sits doing what people do at baseball games. This guy didn't even exist to me. There was no previous conflict. In fact it was pretty serene. I was just thinking about maybe getting a hot dog when this all went down.","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author of the post describes an incident at a baseball game in which they placed their foot on an empty seat, and the person sitting behind them asked them to remove their foot. The author moved their foot over, but the man persisted and flung it off of his seat.\\\\nThe author was understandably annoyed by this action and responded angrily, asking what his problem was. After that, they chose to annoy him by cheering obnoxiously for other team's mistakes and high-fiving everyone around them because he wouldn't look at them.\\\\nWhile the man's actions were rude as well as disrespectful towards others' personal space and possibly property (a baseball stadium seat), he did not act unethically by asking them to move their feet or even flinging it away from him onto another person's seat (which would have been more unethical).\\\\nHowever, after that point, rather than just ignoring him or moving seats themselves if possible (if there were seats available),  the author chose to escalate matters by purposefully annoying him for some time until he left his seats. This action demonstrated a lack of empathy for another human being who had done nothing wrong aside from having a different style preference with regards to seating arrangements at a baseball game. Therefore, \\"RIGHT\\" is the correct answer here because although both parties acted inappropriately in varying degrees during this situation ,the author behaved less ethically than they could have; while they may not have acted unethically per se ,they definitely could have been more understanding of another person's preferences when sharing public space with others; based on our modeling decisions 'not answerable' is only reserved for cases where we cannot tell who behaved less ethically due to lack of information.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you will be presented with a question having multiple possible answers in German language.

The different modulations observed are discussed in respect to vagal components of the epithelial layer. Responses of rat trachea to immunologic stimulation are shown to be dependent on the presence of the epithelium, which prolongs the relaxation stage without affecting the contractions. This prolongation is abolished by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, whereas substance P induces a significantly greater relaxation of serotonin-precontracted intact than deepithelialized trachea. Serotonin concentration-response curves are shifted to the right in intact preparations, which is partly reversed by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, but a hyporeactivity of the tissue exists. A relaxing factor released by the epithelium is hypothesized, possibly dependent on substance P-ergic innervation. Muscarinic cholinergic innervation slightly modulates the contractions but not the relaxations in antigen-induced responses, independently on the presence of the epithelial layer. 4-Aminopyridine induces epithelium-dependent potentiations of contractions to antigen and to serotonin, which involves acetylcholine at one step of the reaction cascade.

Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) was recorded on July 23, 2018.

In this report, we describe diffuse and severe ultrastructural damage to the capillaries of the gastric glandular mucosa of the rat that occurred within 1 min after intragastric instillation of 100% ethanol. There was a gradient of damage in that endothelial cell structure was most severely disrupted in profiles of capillaries located close to the luminal surface but some morphologic evidence of damage was evident in the wall of capillary profiles to a mean depth of 256 micron. Capillary structure was generally normal in the deeper regions of the mucosa. Pretreatment with intragastric cysteamine, 30 mg/100 g, or intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.5 mg/100 g, significantly reduced the depth in the mucosa to which damage to capillaries extended. Pretreatment with intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.2 mg/100 g, afforded no significant protection. We conclude that a 1-min exposure to 100% ethanol induces striking damage to the microcirculation of glandular mucosa of the rat stomach with severe damage to capillary profiles near the lumen and sparing of capillary profiles near the muscularis mucosa, and pretreatment with the sulfhydryl agent, cysteamine, or with a large dose of prostaglandin F2 beta reduces the extent of but does not abolish ethanol-induced damage to gastric mucosal capillaries.","target":"Ethanol-induced damage to mucosal capillaries of rat stomach.

The word \\"sediment\\" refers to tiny pieces of dirt or rock carried by waves and rivers. So if there is little sediment in a river, then it will carry less eroding material than another body of water with higher quantities of sediment. Therefore, an example such as a still river carrying little sediment would have lower rates of erosion compared to other bodies of water with bigger waves and larger amounts of soil/particles eroding away at landmasses surrounding them.\\nHence, we can conclude that low-velocity currents (like those found in slow moving rivers) which transport relatively small amounts sand or gravel particles are likely responsible for causing less erosion when compared against high velocity"},{"source":"The input is a conversation between an automated system and a user, followed by a question.

As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it, \\"parody  is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.\\" Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as \\"any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice.\\"\\nParody may be found in art or culture, including literature, music (although \\"parody\\" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), animation, gaming, and film.\\n\\n- Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term). Alternative names for the \\"count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as \\"Graf\\" in Germany and \\"Hakushaku\\" during the Japanese Imperial era.\\n\\n- Igor , or sometimes Ygor , is a stock character assistant to many types of Gothic villains , such as Count Dracula or Dr. Victor Frankenstein , familiar from many horror movies and horror movie parodies . Although Dr. Frankenstein had a hunchback assistant in the 1931 film Frankenstein , his name was Fritz ; in the original Mary Shelley novel , Dr. Frankenstein has no lab assistant nor does a character named Igor appear .\\n\\n- Wallachia or Walachia (; archaic: ', Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical and geographical region of Romania. It is situated north of the Lower Danube and south of the Southern Carpathians. Wallachia is traditionally divided into two sections, Muntenia (Greater Wallachia) and Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia). Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as Muntenia through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections.\\n\\n- Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") \\n\\n- Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, famous for introducing the character of the vampire Count Dracula.\\n\\n- Victor Frankenstein is the title character of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\\". He is a scientist who, after studying chemical processes and the decay of living beings, gains an insight into the creation of life and gives life to his own creature, often referred to as Frankenstein's monster, or often colloquially referred to as simply \\"Frankenstein\\".\\n\\n- A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. \\n\\n- Popular culture or pop culture is the entirety of ideas, perspectives, attitudes, images, and other phenomena that are within the mainstream of a given culture, especially Western culture of the early to mid 20th century and the emerging global mainstream of the late 20th and early 21st century. Heavily influenced by mass media, this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of the society. The most common pop culture categories are: entertainment (movies, music, television, games), sports, news (as in people/places in news), politics, fashion/clothes, technology, and slang. Popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's attitudes towards certain topics.\\n\\n- Frankenstein's monster, sometimes known as Frankenstein, is a fictional character whose fictional creator was Victor Frankenstein. The monster first appeared, without any name, in Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\\". Shelley's title thus compares Victor Frankenstein to the mythological character Prometheus who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire. Although nameless in Shelley's novel, the creature took on the name \\"Frankenstein\\" in later years. \\n\\n- A cliché or cliche (or ) is an expression, idea, or element of an artistic work which has become overused to the point of losing its original meaning or effect, even to the point of being trite or irritating, especially when at some earlier time it was considered meaningful or novel.\\n\\n- A werewolf (from , \\"man\\"), man-wolf, or lycanthrope (\\"lykánthropos\\": , \\"lykos\\", \\"wolf\\", and , \\"anthrpos\\", \\"human\\") is a mythological or folkloric human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (e.g. via a bite or scratch from another werewolf). Early sources for belief in lycanthropy are Petronius (2766) and Gervase of Tilbury (11501228).\\n\\n- A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism.\\n\\n- A stock character is a stereotypical person whom audiences readily recognize from frequent recurrences in a particular literary tradition. Stock characters are archetypal characters distinguished by their flatness. As a result, they tend to be easy targets for parody and to be criticized as clichés. The presence of a particular array of stock characters is a key component of many genres. The point of the stock character is to move the story along. \\n\\n- Abraham \\"Bram\\" Stoker (8 November 1847  20 April 1912) was an Irish author, best known today for his 1897 Gothic novel \\"Dracula\\". During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, which Irving owned.\\n\\n- Count Dracula is the title character and main antagonist of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel \\"Dracula\\". He is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. He is also depicted in the novel to be the origin of werewolf legends.

The exact immunological mechanisms behind the onset of BNP are not fully understood to date. To gain further insight into these mechanisms, we analyzed the immune proteome from alloreactive antibody producers (BNP cows) and non-responders. After in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood derived lymphocytes (PBL), we detected distinctly deviant expression levels of several master regulators of immune responses in BNP cells, pointing to a changed immune phenotype with severe dysregulation of immune response in BNP cows. Interestingly, we also found this response pattern in 22% of non-BVD-vaccinated cows, indicating a genetic predisposition of this immune deviant (ID) phenotype in cattle.

The Louisiana Purchase occurred during the term of the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson.

Pamela was educated by governesses in the ancestral home at Minterne Magna in Dorset, along with her three younger siblings. Her great-great aunt was the nineteenth-century adventurer and courtesan Jane Digby (1807-1881), notorious for her exotic travels and scandalous personal life. Pamela was to follow in her ancestor's footsteps, being frequently cited as \\"the 20th-century's greatest courtesan.\\"\\n\\nIn 1939, while working at the Foreign Office in London doing French-to-English translations, Pamela met Randolph Churchill, the son of Winston Churchill. Randolph proposed to her on the very evening they met, and they were married on 4 October 1939. Two days after Randolph Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, their son Winston was born. Shortly after giving birth, Pamela and the newborn were photographed by Cecil Beaton for Life magazine, its first cover of a mother with baby.  In February 1941, Randolph was sent to Cairo for military service, where he accrued large gambling debts. His letter to Pamela asking her to make good on his liabilities, along with her affair with W. Averell Harriman, combined to shatter their marriage, but the fault probably lay on both sides. Harriman was known at Chequers by the French phrase habitue de la maison for his frequent stays there in 1941. Harriman was one of the aristocratic set from the US Embassy, charming, suave and sophisticated. They had developed a friendship during the London Blitz, so that by 17 April 1941 they were already close and intimate friends. Jack Colville, Churchill's private secretary was well aware of the affair, but their clandestine relationship had to wait thirty years before consummation in marriage. She completed the circle by becoming a US citizen. Her father-in-law however, was too busy visiting bombed-out Blitz sites to be overly-concerned in 1941.  During 1944 she worked in the Cabinet's war rooms on a secretive SOE mission for Operation Bodyguard working with Robert E. Sherwood. \\"The days at the office were very sorry,\\" wrote Bobby Bevan, a spy who was directly involved with Bodyguard's activities; long days stretched into lonely nights, when they frequently indulged the senses on champagne and Russian caviar. Bodyguard went ahead without allied knowledge or approval, which upset the Soviets. At a critical point prior to the Top Secret D-Day Normandy landings, allied intelligence feared Germany's strength in the Mediterranean; a diversionary attack on the Balkans was designed to distract the Nazis in France. This further encouraged Churchill to switch sides to Tito's Partisans. After the war, Randolph had an affair with Bevan's wife. Eventually, Pamela filed for divorce in December 1945 on the grounds that Randolph had deserted her for three years. Later, after having converted to Catholicism, she obtained an annulment from the Catholic Church.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Pamela Harriman","rationale":"There is only one entity that can be the answer, which is Pamela Harriman.

Raised in Michigan and Ohio, Custer was admitted to West Point in 1857, where he graduated last in his class in 1861. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Custer was called to serve with the Union Army. Custer developed a strong reputation during the Civil War.\\nContext: On June 3, 1865, at Sheridan's behest, Major General Custer accepted command of the 2nd Division of Cavalry, Military Division of the Southwest, to march from Alexandria, Louisiana, to Hempstead, Texas, as part of the Union occupation forces. Custer arrived at Alexandria on June 27 and began assembling his units, which took more than a month to gather and remount. On July 17, he assumed command of the Cavalry Division of the Military Division of the Gulf (on August 5, officially named the 2nd Division of Cavalry of the Military Division of the Gulf), and accompanied by his wife, he led the division (five regiments of veteran Western Theater cavalrymen) to Texas on an arduous 18-day march in August. On October 27, the division departed to Austin. On October 29, Custer moved the division from Hempstead to Austin, arriving on November 4. Major General Custer became Chief of Cavalry of the Department of Texas, from November 13 to February 1, 1866, succeeding Major General Wesley Merritt.  During his entire period of command of the division, Custer encountered considerable friction and near mutiny from the volunteer cavalry regiments who had campaigned along the Gulf coast. They desired to be mustered out of Federal service rather than continue campaigning, resented imposition of discipline (particularly from an Eastern Theater general), and considered Custer nothing more than a vain dandy.  Custer's division was mustered out beginning in November 1865, replaced by the regulars of the U.S. 6th Cavalry Regiment. Although their occupation of Austin had apparently been pleasant, many veterans harbored deep resentments against Custer, particularly in the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry, because of his attempts to maintain discipline. Upon its mustering out, several members planned to ambush Custer, but he was warned the night before and the attempt thwarted.\\nQuestion: Did he do anything in texas?.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature.

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane.

An elderly Dr. John Watson tells his nurse the tale of an unrecorded case he shared with his friend Sherlock Holmes. In 1882, Holmes and Watson investigate the shipwreck of a royal treasury ship which was destroyed by a monstrous giant octopus on the coast of Newhaven. They do not believe the first-hand accounts of the sole survivor of the attack, but nonetheless investigate. Inspector Lestrade states that he has recently had contact with Holmes's estranged brother Thorpe, a former partner of Lestrade's who was paralyzed during a bank robbery seven years prior.\\nIn Whitechapel, a young man is killed by a dinosaur. Watson is skeptical until he and Holmes discover the creature on their morning constitution. Finding escape, several more clues lead Holmes to deduce that the monsters are artificial, built by a criminal genius to acquire resources. On the case, the dinosaur steals a water pump operating a fountain and rolls of copper wire, presumably so Spring-Heeled Jack can create another monster. The octopus that destroyed the ship earlier is linked to the dinosaur because they are both similarly \\"exceptionally improbable\\".

The match-up would be notable with former Ravens RB Jamal Lewis now playing for Cleveland.  In the first quarter, Baltimore trailed early as the Browns took their opening drive and ended it with QB Derek Anderson (another former Raven) completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Joe Jurevicius.  Also, immediately after QB Steve McNair got intercepted, Cleveland cashed in with Anderson completing a 78-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  In the second quarter, Baltimore managed to get on the board with kicker Matt Stover getting a 21-yard field goal.  However, the Browns continued their offensive surge with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 41-yard field goal, along with Lewis getting a 1-yard TD run.  Even though instant replay showed that the ball was just shy of breaking the plane of the goal line, the Ravens' coaching staff was unable to challenge the play in time.  They would end the half with Stover kicking a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cleveland continued its surgence with Dawson kicking a 20-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Baltimore tried to come back, but the only thing from their comeback was McNair's 4-yard TD pass to TE Quinn Sypniewski.  With the surprising loss, the Ravens fell to 2-2, despite outgaining the Browns 418-303 in total offense.

They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Dan studied genetic engineering.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business.

The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin.

Further east, the kingdoms of Poland, Hungary, and Bohemia grew powerful. In Iberia, the Christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula; Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century, while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns. After losing the Hundred Years' War, England went on to suffer a long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when Henry Tudor (r. 1485–1509 as Henry VII) became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III (r. 1483–85) at Bosworth in 1485. In Scandinavia, Margaret I of Denmark (r. in Denmark 1387–1412) consolidated Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the Union of Kalmar, which continued until 1523. The major power around the Baltic Sea was the Hanseatic League, a commercial confederation of city states that traded from Western Europe to Russia.

It was shown at America's Millennium Gala on December 31, 1999, in the National Mall at the Reflecting Pool at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.  Spielberg resigned as a member of the national advisory board of the Boy Scouts of America in 2001 because of his disapproval of the organization's anti-homosexuality stance.

It survives as part of a composite manuscript volume held at the British Library with the mark Cotton Claudius A.v, in which it appears on folios 2–45. An edition of the Chronicon was published in 1723 by Joseph Sparke, in a collection of English histories by various writers.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness.

These issues have been diagnosed by many psychiatrists and I’ve even been hospitalized for months on end because of them.  This may seem irrelevant to the story I’m about to tell you but bare with me it comes into play. BIG TIME. \\n\\nSo my father, we will call him Joe, he has a girlfriend whom we will call Mary. Joe and Mary have been together for around 8 months now and Mary even has a daughter who is fairly close to my age (her age being 20) and we share the same interests and mental health problems. We both have anxiety and clinical depression, her having anxiety more intense than mine and I also suffer from something called borderline personality disorder. (This causes you to have extreme mood swings and fear of abandonment issues) We shall call the daughter Mei. \\n\\nSo here’s where the actual story takes place. A few days ago on Saturday, Joe and I went to his girlfriends house to spend time. Me and Mei were telling Mary about how once we ordered Uber eats and both had anxiety attacks that the delivery guy was going to kill us and I had pulled a knife and hid behind the door. Joe chimes in even though he’s not included in the conversation and starts downplaying our mental illnesses. He starts saying things like \\n\\n“Oh, how can you guys have anxiety! Just done give a fuck about what’s going on!” \\n \\n“Oh come on really? BPD isn’t even that bad hahah you could’ve had cancer or something just shattttupppp” \\n\\nGee, thanks, my anxiety is now cured. Anyways he kept saying stuff like that and it was clearly angering everyone in the room. Me especially because he kept mentioning my disorder (BPD) even though he knows it causes me to cut myself and that’s what got me hospitalized. \\nSo I accidentally slipped up and said\\n\\n “shut the fuck up” \\n\\nAt that point I knew I done goofed and instantly lowered my head. I apologized profusely and said I didn’t mean to say that and that I was out of line and he laughed it off and went upstairs. The next day when we were leaving he started screaming at me in the car. He told me he should’ve slapped me in my face and embarrassed me. I was super tired and the words went right through one ear and out the other.  \\n\\nFast forward to Monday. Me and my father joe didn’t speak all Monday with exception of him sending me texts saying what he told me in the car but now with a twist. \\n\\n“It’s February 11th and you have until the end of the week to get another job or else I’m selling everything you own, because I bought it. Welcome to reality.” \\n\\nThis caused me to have an anxiety attack at school and I went home early. I did apply to some places and thank goodness got a call back and I have an interview on Thursday. Anyways, on Tuesday I had to stay home because schools were cancelled due to an snow storm and he didn’t go to work for the same reason. He took this as his chance to burst into my room and scream at me. He called me every name in the book, he threatened to yank my piercings out my face, he even took it upon himself to yank the hood of my sweater basically choking me just so I would look at him. Mind you by that time he had already screamed at me to clean my room so I was folding clothes, that’s why I wasn’t looking at him.  I started screaming because I thought he was going to hit me in my face like he said he would and I had a major breakdown. Now my grandma says that if I try to leave and stay anywhere else he and the rest of my family will cut me off. \\n\\nAITA for telling him to shut the fuck up? \\n\\nEdit: guys how I put screenshots ??

John survives the crash unscathed, but Mary is hospitalized. After Mary dies of an unrelated brain tumor, John discovers mysterious drawings of the creature that she had created prior to the night of the accident. Two years later, John becomes lost in West Virginia and inexplicably finds himself in Point Pleasant, hundreds of miles off his route. Driving in the middle of the night, his car breaks down; and he walks to a nearby house to get help. The owner, Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton), reacts violently to John's appearance and holds him at gunpoint. Local police officer Connie Mills (Laura Linney) defuses the situation while Gordon explains that this is the third consecutive night John has knocked on his door asking to use a phone, much to John's confusion. John stays at a local motel and considers how he ended up so far from his original destination. Officer Mills mentions to John that many strange things have been occurring in the past few weeks and that people report seeing a large winged creature like a giant moth with red eyes. She also tells John about a strange dream she had, in which the words \\"Wake up, Number 37\\" were spoken to her. While conversing with Gordon one day, it is revealed to John that he had heard voices from his sink telling him that, in Denver, \\"99 will die\\". While discussing the day's events at a local diner, John notices that the news is showing a story on an airplane crash in Denver that killed all 99 passengers aboard. The next night, Gordon frantically explains that he had met the voices in his head, a being named Indrid Cold Later that night, Gordon calls John and says that he is standing with a character named Indrid Cold. While John keeps Cold on the line, Officer Mills checks on Gordon. Cold answers John's questions, convincing him that he is a supernatural being. This episode starts a string of supernatural calls to John's motel room. One tells him that there will be a great tragedy on the Ohio River. Later, John receives a call from Gordon and rushes to his home to check on him. He finds Gordon outside, dead from exposure. John becomes obsessed with the being, dubbed Mothman. He meets an expert on the subject, Alexander Leek (Alan Bates), who explains its nature and discourages John from becoming further involved. However, when John learns the governor (Murphy Dunne) plans to tour a chemical plant located on the Ohio River the following day, he becomes convinced the tragedy will occur there. Officer Mills and the governor ignore his warnings, and nothing happens during the tour. Soon afterwards, John receives a mysterious message that instructs him to await a call from his deceased wife Mary back in Georgetown, and he returns home. On Christmas Eve, Officer Mills calls and convinces him to ignore the phone call from \\"Mary\\", return to Point Pleasant, and join her. Though anguished, John agrees.

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony. The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album.\\nContext: Van Halen's next lead singer was Gary Cherone, frontman of the then-defunct Boston-based band Extreme, a group which had enjoyed some popular success in the early 1990s. The result was the album Van Halen III. Many songs were longer and more experimental than Van Halen's earlier work. It was a notable contrast from their previous material, with more focus on ballads than traditional rock songs (\\"How Many Say I,\\" with Eddie on vocals). Sales were poor by the band's standards, only reaching Gold certification, despite the album peaking at No. 4 on the U.S. charts. However, Van Halen III did produce the hit \\"Without You,\\" and another album track, \\"Fire in the Hole,\\" appeared on the Lethal Weapon 4 soundtrack. The album was followed by a tour. The III Tour saw Van Halen playing in new countries, including first ever visits to Australia and New Zealand.  Shortly afterwards, Van Halen returned to the studio and in early 1999, they started work on a new album. Working titles of songs included \\"Left for Dead,\\" \\"River Wide,\\" \\"Say Uncle,\\" \\"You Wear it Well,\\" \\"More Than Yesterday,\\" \\"I Don't Miss You ... Much,\\" \\"Love Divine,\\" and \\"From Here, Where Do We Go?\\". The project was left unfinished when Cherone left the band amicably in November 1999. Citing musical differences, it is likely III's poor sales and critical reception had a big impact. None of the material from these sessions has ever been released, and in fact the band released no new material at all until three new songs were included on the 2004 Best of Both Worlds compilation. Lyrics that Cherone had written for the Van Halen III follow up would be used in his next project with Tribe of Judah.  Touring with Cherone had proven disappointing in terms of attendance. Eddie would later admit that \\"the powers that be\\" (Warner Bros.) had forced his hand in parting with Cherone. Unlike with the previous two singers, there was reportedly no bad blood behind the breakup, and Cherone remained in contact and on good terms with Van Halen.

Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \\"sketch\\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species.

The first of four children, he was born two months premature and weighed less than three pounds. His father served as a private in Company B, 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War, and Goebel's mother raised her children alone, teaching them much about their German heritage. Wilhelm spoke only German until the age of six, but embraced the culture of his birth country as well, adopting the English spelling of his name.\\n\\nIn 1887, James W. Bryan vacated his seat in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of lieutenant governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, but this was not to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election close - decided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.  With only the two years remaining in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel took aim at a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed and sent to the Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero in his district. He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent.  In 1890, Goebel was a delegate to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as a delegate, Goebel showed little interest in participating in the process of creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"William Goebel","rationale":"The answer to this question can be inferred from the context. \\nFrom the given text, it is clear that William Goebel was born in United States of America and his parents were immigrants from Germany.

For most of its length, it defines the border between these two provinces. It is a major tributary of the St. Lawrence River.\\n\\n- Algonquin Provincial Park is a provincial park located between Georgian Bay and the Ottawa River in Southern Ontario, Canada, mostly within the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. Established in 1893, it is the oldest provincial park in Canada. Additions since its creation have increased the park to its current size of about . For comparison purposes, this is about one and a half times the size of Prince Edward Island or about a quarter of the size of Belgium. The park is contiguous with several smaller, administratively separate provincial parks that protect important rivers in the area, resulting in a larger total protected area.\\n\\n- FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.\\n\\n- The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada.

The Saint Lawrence River flows in a roughly north-easterly direction, connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean and forming the primary drainage outflow of the Great Lakes Basin. It traverses the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and is part of the international boundary between Ontario, Canada, and the U.S. state of New York. This river also provides the basis of the commercial Saint Lawrence Seaway.\\n\\n- Bonnechere River Provincial Park is located along the Bonnechere River in Ontario , Canada . A 23 km ( 14 mi ) long section of the Bonnechere River , starting at the Algonquin Park boundary and terminating at Bonnechere Provincial Park , has been protected as a waterway provincial park . It is a \`\` non-operating '' park , meaning no fees are charged and no staff are present with only a few services offered . This scenic portion of the river is particularly suitable for canoe camping .\\n\\n- A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.\\n\\n- Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.\\n\\n- Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest. \\n\\n- Ottawa is the capital city of Canada.

Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region.\\n\\n- In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian  (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.\\n\\n- The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.\\n\\n- Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.\\n\\n- Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada.

As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\\n\\n- Nunavut (from Inuktitut:  ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.\\n\\n- A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.\\n\\n- Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.\\n\\n- Renfrew is a county in the Canadian province of Ontario. There are 17 municipalities in the county.\\n\\n- A provincial park (or territorial park) is a park administered by one of the provinces of a country, as opposed to a national park. They are similar to state parks in other countries. They are typically open to the public for recreation. Their environment may be more or less strictly protected. Argentina, Belgium, Canada and South Africa are among the countries that have provincial parks.\\n\\n- Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)  were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area.\\n\\n- The Bonnechere River is a river in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin in Nipissing District and Renfrew County in eastern and northeastern Ontario, Canada. The river flows from Algonquin Provincial Park to the Ottawa River east and north of the town of Renfrew.

Arakan lost the port city of Syriam in Lower Burma in 1603 when its Portuguese governor Filipe de Brito e Nicote declared that he was now loyal to the Portuguese viceroy of Goa. After two failed expeditions by the Arakanese navy to retake the port in 1604 and 1605, Arakan gave up its claims on the Lower Burma coastline. Arakan's Portuguese troubles were not yet over. In 1609, its northern territories at the edge of Ganges delta and off Chittagong came under threat by the Portuguese mercenaries and the Mughal government in Bengal. In March 1609, 400 Portuguese mercenaries, led by Sebastian Gonzales Tibao, seized the Sandwip island. Meanwhile, the Mughal governor of Bengal tried to take over Noakhali District. Min Yazagyi was forced to enter into an alliance with the Portuguese to drive out the Mughals. After the Mughals were driven out, Gonzales promptly seized the Arakanese navy, and began raiding as far south as Lemro river. Later, the Portuguese viceroy at Goa sanctioned an attack on Mrauk-U itself. In November 1615, a fleet of 14 Portuguese galliots and 50 smaller war boats led by Francis de Meneses sailed up the Lemro. Alas, the fleet was driven back by Arakanese defences, which included broadsides of a few Dutch ships.

Methods: A total of 10,429 specimens were analyzed, and IgM antibodies against 9 respiratory pathogens including MP were detected using indirect immunofluorescence assay from serum. Results: It showed that 59.3% of the enrolled children were positive for at least 1 pathogen; highest detection rates included those between 3 and <6 years of age (70.4%), female (63.2%), and who were hospitalized in 2014 (80.9%). The most predominant pathogen was MP (45.6%), followed by Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) (22.6%) and influenza B viruses (IFVB) (14.7%). Coinfection was observed in 2,907 specimens (27.9%); the coinfection combination containing MP and PIVs had the highest detection rate of 15%, followed by MP and IFVB as well as IFVB and PIVs. Conclusions: MP was the most commonly detected bacteria among hospitalized children, which should be included in the differential diagnosis for hospitalized children with RTI.

While near-term motion can be predicted accurately, long-term predictions suffer from accumulating input and prediction errors which can lead to plausible but different trajectories that diverge from the ground truth.   A system that predicts distributions of the future physical states for long time horizons based on its uncertainty is thus a promising solution.   In this work, we introduce a novel robust Monte Carlo sampling based graph-convolutional dropout method that allows us to sample multiple plausible trajectories for an initial state given a neural-network based forward dynamics predictor.   By introducing a new shape preservation loss and training our dynamics model recurrently, we stabilize long-term predictions. We show that our model’s long-term forward dynamics prediction errors on complicated physical interactions of rigid and deformable objects of various shapes are significantly lower than existing strong baselines. Lastly, we demonstrate how generating multiple trajectories with our Monte Carlo dropout method can be used to train model-free reinforcement learning agents faster and to better solutions on simple manipulation tasks.","target":"We propose a stochastic differentiable forward dynamics predictor that is able to sample multiple physically plausible trajectories under the same initial input state and show that it can be used to train model-free policies more efficiently","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose a stochastic differentiable forward dynamics predictor that is able to sample multiple physically plausible trajectories under the same initial input state and show that it can be used to train model-free policies more efficiently.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you will be given two sentences separated by \\"because\\".

Trying to capitalize on that weakness, Tatars, who commonly raided across the Commonwealth borders in search of loot and plunder, invaded, this time allying themselves with Cossacks under hetman Doroshenko. They were however stopped by Commonwealth forces under hetman John Sobieski, who stopped their first push , defeating them several times, and finally gaining an armistice after the Battle of Podhajce. In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried once again to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, supportive of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but again like in 1666-67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed.

Numerous studies have shown that H(2)S has vasodilator and antihypertensive effects in the cardiovascular system. However, intracellular mechanisms of the H(2)S-induced vasodilation and its interactions with other endothelium-derived relaxing factors, such as nitric oxide (NO), remain unclear. We investigated whether H(2)S directly regulates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and NO production in endothelial cells. NaHS, a H(2)S donor, dose-dependently increased NO production in cultured endothelial cells. This effect was abolished by a calcium chelator (BAPTA-AM), but not by the absence of extracellular calcium. The NaHS-induced NO production was partially blocked by inhibitors of ryanodine receptor (dantrolene) or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (xestospongin C). NaHS significantly increased intracellular calcium concentrations, and this effect was attenuated by dantrolene or xestospongin C. NaHS induced phosphorylation of eNOS at the activating phosphoserine residue 1179. The NaHS-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO production were not affected by a PI3K/Akt inhibitor (wortmannin). The data of this study suggest that H(2)S directly acts on endothelial cells to induce eNOS activation and NO production by releasing calcium from the intracellular store in endoplasmic reticulum, which may explain one of mechanisms of its vasodilator function.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract lacks a main topic sentence, and the sentences are not organized in a way that allows readers to easily follow or understand the structure of the research.

Twelve days after Chinese troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China. After decimating the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and U.S. military occurred on 1 November 1950; deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the U.S. 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan. The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the Ch'ongch'on River, while the Chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory.

Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology. Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of \\"man's place in the universe\\". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of genetics, which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, James D. Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins clarified the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms. In the late 20th century, the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome (the Human Genome Project).\\n\\nQ: Which scientist championed the idea of evolution?","target":"Charles Darwin","rationale":"The context states that the theory of evolution was championed by Charles Darwin.\\n\\nSince this is a fact question, it can be answered directly from the passage."},{"source":"Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type.

During the seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition.

It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.","target":"phylogenetics","rationale":"The context mentions systematic botany and its relation to other branches of biology.

The study was conducted double-blind on 2 days, 1 week apart, using a placebo-controlled crossover design. On each day, measurements at rest were made before and 20 minutes after 20 mg sublingual nifedipine or placebo and were followed by measurements made during exercise. Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased heart rate and cardiac output at rest and during exercise. It did not alter mean pulmonary artery or pulmonary artery wedge pressures at rest, but decreased them during exercise. Nifedipine decreased arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) from 96 +/- 10 to 90 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at rest and from 99 +/- 11 to 92 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) at submaximal exercise (33 +/- 21 W), but did not alter it (100 +/- 12 versus 100 +/- 16 mm Hg, p = NS) at maximal exercise (68 +/- 30 W). The reduction in PaO2 was not due to alveolar hypoventilation, because nifedipine did not alter arterial carbon dioxide tension, or to changes in mixed venous oxygen tension, which nifedipine increased at rest (39 +/- 2 versus 43 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and during submaximal exercise (31 +/- 4 versus 33 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.03) and maximal exercise (27 +/- 3 versus 31 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","target":"Adult","rationale":"The abstract reports the results of a study that investigated the effects of nifedipine on arterial oxygenation and hemodynamics in men with exertional angina.

In some instances, The Powhatan, may refer to one of the leaders of the people. This is most commonly the case in historical writings by the English. The Powhatans have also been known as Virginia Algonquians, as the Powhatan language is an eastern-Algonquian language also known as Virginia Algonquian.\\n\\nIn November 1609, Captain John Ratcliffe was invited to Orapakes, Powhatan's new capital. After he had sailed up the Pamunkey River to trade there, a fight broke out between the colonists and the Powhatan. All of the English ashore were killed, including Ratcliffe, who was tortured by the women of the tribe. Those aboard the pinnace escaped and told the tale at Jamestown.  During that next year, the tribe attacked and killed many Jamestown residents. The residents fought back, but only killed twenty. However, arrival at Jamestown of a new Governor, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, (Lord Delaware) in June 1610 signalled the beginning of the First Anglo-Powhatan War. A brief period of peace came only after the capture of Pocahontas, her baptism, and her marriage to tobacco planter John Rolfe in 1614. Within a few years both Powhatan and Pocahontas were dead. Powhatan died in Virginia, but Pocahontas died while in England. Meanwhile, the English settlers continued to encroach on Powhatan territory.  After Wahunsunacawh's death, his younger brother, Opitchapam, briefly became chief, followed by their younger brother Opechancanough. In 1622 (Indian massacre of 1622) and 1644 he attacked the English to force them from Powhatan territories. Both these attempts were met with strong reprisals from the English, ultimately resulting in the near destruction of the tribe. The Second Anglo-Powhatan War that followed the 1644 incident ended in 1646, after Royal Governor of Virginia William Berkeley's forces captured Opechancanough, thought to be between 90 and 100 years old. While a prisoner, Opechancanough was killed, shot in the back by a soldier assigned to guard him. He was succeeded as Weroance by Necotowance, and later by Totopotomoi and by his daughter Cockacoeske.  The Treaty of 1646 marked the effective dissolution of the united confederacy, as white colonists were granted an exclusive enclave between the York and Blackwater Rivers. This physically separated the Nansemonds, Weyanokes and Appomattox, who retreated southward, from the other Powhatan tribes then occupying the Middle Peninsula and Northern Neck. While the southern frontier demarcated in 1646 was respected for the remainder of the 17th century, the House of Burgesses lifted the northern one on September 1, 1649. Waves of new immigrants quickly flooded the peninsular region, then known as Chickacoan, and restricted the dwindling tribes to lesser tracts of land that became some of the earliest Indian reservations.  In 1665, the House of Burgesses passed stringent laws requiring the Powhatan to accept chiefs appointed by the governor. After the Treaty of Albany in 1684, the Powhatan Confederacy all but vanished.\\n\\nWhen did they sign a treaty?","target":"The Treaty of 1646","rationale":"The Treaty of 1646 is mentioned in the article as marking \\"\\"the effective dissolution of the united confederacy\\"\\"."},{"source":"Choose between \\"cone far away\\" and  \\"cone near\\".\\nQuestion: Opie saw a traffic cone behind the school bus when it made a stop.

Much of the Asian side of the Bosphorus functions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in European Istanbul, accounting for a third of the city's population but only a quarter of its employment. As a result of Istanbul's exponential growth in the 20th century, a significant portion of the city is composed of gecekondus (literally \\"built overnight\\"), referring to illegally constructed squatter buildings. At present, some gecekondu areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern mass-housing compounds. Moreover, large scale gentrification and urban renewal projects have been taking place, such as the one in Tarlabaşı; some of these projects, like the one in Sulukule, have faced criticism.

It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers.","target":"higher","rationale":"If the mercury in a thermometer expands, it means that the temperature of its surroundings has increased.

One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues","rationale":"The question asks the reader to identify what is different between characteristics.

We have examined the effects of five other estrogens: estriol, estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol, and the metabolism-resistant analogs ethynyl estradiol and moxestrol. All were full agonists for both effects, and all were more potent for the stimulation of cell growth than for stimulation of PRL production. The order of analog potency for both biological effects was the same as the order of potency for inhibiting saturable [3H]estradiol binding to intact cells. Therefore, both biological effects appear to be mediated through the same receptor, and metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol is unlikely to account for the difference in the concentrations required to elicit the two effects. We selected two estrogen-responsive clones from a cDNA library made from GH4C1 cells. The clones were chosen because they were induced at the estrogen concentrations that stimulate growth. Estradiol caused maximal stimulation of the mRNAs corresponding to the two recombinant clones at 10(-10) M, a concentration over 10-fold lower than that required for maximal stimulation of PRL mRNA. These data indicate that a difference in sensitivity to estrogen occurs at the level of mRNA accumulation as well as at the level of the biological responses. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Regulation of prolactin production and cell growth by estradiol: difference in sensitivity to estradiol occurs at level of messenger ribonucleic acid accumulation. option2: In vivo versus in vitro labeling of red blood cells in hepatic cavernous hemangioma [letter]","target":"Regulation of prolactin production and cell growth by estradiol: difference in sensitivity to estradiol occurs at level of messenger ribonucleic acid accumulation","rationale":"The abstract is about the regulation of cellular growth and prolactin (PRL) production by estradiol in somatotroph cells.

The authors found that metabolism-resistant analogs of estradiol are more potent for stimulating cell growth than they are for stimulating PRL production, but these analogs can only stimulate both biological responses at concentrations that inhibit binding to intact cells. Two estrogen-responsive clones from a cDNA library made from GH4C1 cells were also selected for further study. Estradiol caused maximal stimulation of the mRNAs corresponding to the two recombinant clones at 10(-10) M, which is over 10 times lower than required for maximal stimulation of PRL mRNA. These results demonstrate that there is a difference in sensitivity to estrogen at both the mRNA level and at the level of biological responses such as cell growth and PRL production.\\" As a result, Option 1 \\"Regulation of prolactin production and cell growth by estradiol: difference in sensitivity to estradiol occurs at level of messenger ribonucleic acid accumulation\\" would be an appropriate title because it accurately reflects content described in this abstract.\\","},{"source":"You are given a conversation between two people.

Best Answer: The sperm can actually survive for up to 7 days inside the woman's reproductive tract... but this is VERY, VERY rare. More common is about three days. The length of their life inside the female body really depends on the environment, or the cervical mucus being made and how strong the sperms are... 30 - 60 minutes: Sperm can pass through uterus into fallopian tube in as little as 30 minutes ; fertilization can take place in less than an hour from entry thru the cervix. This is length of time sperm normally spends in uterus. Fertilization takes place in fallopian tubes ; embryo inplants in the womb. To become pregnant, the following steps must occur: 1  Sperm Transport — The sperm must be deposited and transported to the site of fertilization. 2  Egg Transport — Ovulation must occur and the egg must be picked up by the tube. 3  Fertilization and Embryo Development — Union between the sperm and egg must result. Since sperm can live in a woman’s body for up to five days, and the egg can only live for 12-24 hours, it makes sense to have the sperm “ready and waiting” when the egg is released, if a couple is trying to get pregnant. These enzymes quickly destroy any sperm that can’t swim out of the semen within a few hours. It takes approximately 72 days for sperm to mature in the body.

Passage 1:Traidenis, known for his devotion to paganism and anti-German attitude, was also successful in fighting with the Livonian Order. In 1270 he won the Battle of Karuse, fought on ice near Saaremaa, and killed Otto von Lutterberg, master of the Order. A new master, Andreas von Westfalen, sought a quick revenge, but was also killed by Traidenis. However, by 1272 the Order retaliated, attacking Semigalia and building Dinaburg Castle in 1273 on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis. Despite four siege engines used to throw stones, he was unable to capture the new fortress and had to retreat in 1278. In 1279 the order attacked Lithuanian lands, reaching as far as Kernavė, but on their way back they suffered a great defeat in the Battle of Aizkraukle. The Order's master, Ernst von Rassburg, became the third master to be killed by Traidenis. The defeat encouraged conquered Semigallians to rebel. The Semigalians, led by Nameisis, were now willing to acknowledge Lithuania's superiority and asked Traidenis for assistance. In 1281, Traidenis conquered Jersika Castle in the present-day Preiļi District, and was able to exchange it for Dinaburg Castle. However, Traidenis died soon afterwards, and assistance to Semigalians, exhausted by constant warfare, diminished. Traidenis is the first known Lithuanian duke to have died a natural death. All others before him were assassinated or killed in battle.\\n Passage 2:Following their win over the Chargers, the Patriots flew to Orchard Park, New York for an AFC East duel with the Buffalo Bills.
