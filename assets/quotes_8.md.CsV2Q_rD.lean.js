Not only did you answer my questions, you even took it a step further with replying with more pertinent information I needed to know. How does kratom stay in your system? - Answered by a verified Drug Testing Expert They are bluffing about randomly testing for it. But if he gets a random false positive for opiates, which happens more than you think, and he denies doing opiates then they will probably send it off for kratom. But kratom won't stay in your system longer than 30 hours tops, it has a short half life of around 3 hours. But if his drug court is anything like mine (I mean my friends) then they will arrest him just for doing kratom, because it's a prohibited substance on that program. The fastest elimination of the kratom alkaloids is 7 hours which means that is going to be there in the system for 1.64 days. In contrast, the slowest elimination half life was found to be 39.91 which means that the drug is cleared form the system in 9 days. For this reason, it is necessary to consider variables such as: specific kratom source, the individual using kratom, dosage ingested, frequency of usage, and co-administered drugs – when contemplating how long Kratom is likely to remain in your system.

Storm) is a Japanese boy band consisting of five members formed under the Johnny & Associates talent agency. The members are Ohno Satoshi, Sakurai Sho, Aiba Masaki, Ninomiya Kazunari, and Matsumoto Jun. Arashi officially formed on September 15, 1999, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and made their debut CD on November 3, 1999. The group was initially signed to Pony Canyon and released one studio album and six singles--beginning with their 1999 eponymous debut single before moving to the Johnny's subsidiary label J Storm in 2001, which was initially set up for their succeeding releases.\\n\\nArashi began 2002 by releasing their first single under J Storm. \\"A Day in Our Life\\" was used as the theme song for Sakurai's comedy drama Kisarazu Cat's Eye and debuted atop of the Oricon weekly singles chart selling 226,480 copies. Their subsequent releases of the year, \\"Nice na Kokoroiki\\" and \\"Pikanchi\\", were used as the theme songs for the anime Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Koen-mae Hashutsujo and Arashi's movie Pikanchi Life is Hard Dakedo Happy (pikanchi Life is HarddakedoHappy, Pikanchi Life is Hard But Happy) respectively.  Starting in 2003, the group would only release two singles every year until 2007. Both singles released in 2003, \\"Tomadoi Nagara\\" and \\"Hadashi no Mirai/Kotoba Yori Taisetsu na Mono\\", debuted at number two on the charts. The song \\"Kotoba Yori Taisetsu na Mono\\" marked the first time a member contributed to the penning of a single, as many of the group's songs are produced by other lyricists, composers, or musicians. Sakurai, who is the designated rapper of Arashi, has since written all the incorporated rap lyrics of the group's releases.  2004 was Arashi's fifth anniversary since debut. They began the year by releasing their twelfth single, \\"Pikanchi Double\\", in February as the theme song for their second movie Pikanchi Life is Hard Dakara Happy (pikanchi Life is HarddakaraHappy, Pikanchi Life is Hard Thus Happy). Selling 89,106 copies in the first week, it is Arashi's lowest-selling single to date. In celebration of their anniversary, the group released a greatest hits album 5x5 The Best Selection of 2002-2004, which included their second 2004 single \\"Hitomi no Naka no Galaxy/Hero\\".  In 2005, on New Year's Day, Arashi released their first concert DVD since How's It Going? in 2003 titled 2004 Arashi! Iza, Now Tour!!. From July 26 to August 24, they embarked on a summer tour titled One to support their album of the same name. One of the highlights of the tour included the live performance their first single of the year, \\"Sakura Sake\\", on top of \\"Johnny's Moving Stage\\" (ziyanizumubingusutezi, Janizu Mubingu Suteji), a transparent stage that travels over the top of the audience. Invented by Matsumoto, \\"Johnny's Moving Stage\\" has since been used in a majority of Arashi's concerts to allow them to move closer to the audience seated at a distance from the main stage. In November, Arashi released a theme song for the manga-based drama Hana Yori Dango, which starred Matsumoto as one of the lead actors. \\"Wish\\" went on to sell an estimated 178,000 copies in its first week and over 300,000 copies by the end of its chart run, making it their first single to sell over 300,000 copies in total in nearly three years since \\"A Day in Our Life\\" in 2002.\\n\\nAre there any other interesting aspects about this article?","target":"2004 was Arashi's fifth anniversary since debut.

One of the radiations was in the ultraviolet spectrum. He categorized it as spec A. The other radiation was the visible light. He categorized it as spec B. He then searched online to find the pros and cons of each of them.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: There is a zone of the atmosphere in which ozone absorbs some 98% of non-ionizing but dangerous UV-C and UV-B. This so-called ozone layer starts at about 20 miles (32 km) and extends upward. Some of the ultraviolet spectrum that does reach the ground (the part that begins above energies of 3.1 eV, a wavelength less than 400 nm) is non-ionizing, but is still biologically hazardous due to the ability of single photons of this energy to cause electronic excitation in biological molecules, and thus damage them by means of unwanted reactions. An example is the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which begins at wavelengths below 365 nm (3.4 eV), which is well below ionization energy. This property gives the ultraviolet spectrum some of the dangers of ionizing radiation in biological systems without actual ionization occurring. In contrast, visible light and longer-wavelength electromagnetic radiation, such as infrared, microwaves, and radio waves, consists of photons with too little energy to cause damaging molecular excitation, and thus this radiation is far less hazardous per unit of energy.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which radiation would be more hazardous, spec A or spec B?","target":"spec A","rationale":"spec A is in the ultraviolet spectrum, which means that it has a higher frequency and energy than spec B (visible light).\\nThe background information mentions UV-C and UV-B as two forms of non-ionizing radiation. The harmful effects of these radiations are due to their high energies causing molecules to break apart. This implies that any form of electromagnetic radiation with an even higher energy would be more dangerous since they can cause greater damage by breaking down more molecules at once. \\nThus, Spec A will be more hazardous because its wavelength is shorter than 365 nm (3.4 eV), meaning that it falls into the non-ionising part of the ultraviolet spectrum where DNA pyrimidine dimers begin forming in biological systems."},{"source":"After the start of the civil war, various new telecommunications companies began to spring up in the country and competed to provide missing infrastructure.

Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20]\\n\\nParagraph: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area,  because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which year was the subtropical ridge suppressed to the south?","target":"2019","rationale":"The subtropical ridge is a large scale area of high pressure.

This typically occurs during El Nino years (when sea surface temperatures are warmest near South America) as we saw with 2018. Conversely, when there is no El Nino forcing or if La Nina conditions exist instead (cold water), this causes the jet stream across much of Canada and Alaska to dip farther southward than usual,[20] which results in more southerly winds into Arizona where they can pick up heat and humidity before flowing back northwest toward California[21].\\n\\nIn 2019"},{"source":"In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length.\\n\\nDuring the processes of human population dispersal around the world over the past 50 000-100 000 years, along with associated cultural evolution and inter-population contact and conflict, there have been several major transitions in the relationships of Homo sapiens with the natural world, animate and inanimate. Each of these transitions has resulted in the emergence of new or unfamiliar infectious diseases. The three great historical transitions since the initial advent of agriculture and livestock herding, from ca. 10 000 years ago, occurred when: (i) early agrarian-based settlements enabled sylvatic enzootic microbes to make contact with Homo sapiens; (ii) early Eurasian civilizations (such as the Greek and Roman empires, China and south Asia) came into military and commercial contact, ca. 3000-2000 years ago, swapping their dominant infections; and (iii) European expansionism, over the past five centuries, caused the transoceanic spread of often lethal infectious diseases. This latter transition is best known in relation to the conquest of the Americas by Spanish conquistadores, when the inadvertent spread of measles, smallpox and influenza devastated the Amerindian populations. Today, we are living through the fourth of these great transitional periods. The contemporary spread and increased lability of various infectious diseases, new and old, reflect the combined and increasingly widespread impacts of demographic, environmental, behavioural, technological and other rapid changes in human ecology. Modern clinical medicine has, via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and the use of hypodermic syringes, created new opportunities for microbes. These have contributed to the rising iatrogenic problems of hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS and several other viral infections. Meanwhile, the injudicious use of antibiotics has been a rare instance of human action actually increasing 'biodiversity'. Another aspect of this fourth transition is that modern hyper-hygienic living restricts microbial exposure in early life. This, in the 1950s, may have contributed to an epidemic of more serious, disabling, poliomyelitis, affecting older children than those affected in earlier, more endemic decades. As with previous human-microbe transitions, a new equilibrial state may lie ahead. However, it certainly will not entail a world free of infectious diseases. Any mature, sustainable, human ecology must come to terms with both the need for, and the needs of, the microbial species that help to make up the interdependent system of life on Earth. Humans and microbes are not 'at war'; rather, both parties are engaged in amoral, self-interested, coevolutionary struggle. We need to understand better, and therefore anticipate, the dynamics of that process.","target":"Environmental and social influences on emerging infectious diseases: past, present and future","rationale":"The title should reflect the contents of the paper, which discusses environmental and social influences on emerging infectious diseases throughout history.

In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant.

The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor.\\n\\nThe Colbert Report satirized conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, and focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, described as \\"a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\\" Colbert joined Comedy Central's The Daily Show in 1997, a year following its launch, then hosted by Craig Kilborn. When Jon Stewart became the program's host in 1999, The Daily Show developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Colbert recalled that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy.  Colbert became a fixture on The Daily Show, occasionally hosting in Stewart's absence. In 2003, the program began running advertisements for a fictional program titled The Colbert Report, starring Colbert as a parody of cable news pundits. When fellow Daily Show star Steve Carell left to pursue a film and television career, Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. He pitched The Colbert Report to the channel in 2004. Stewart pushed Comedy Central to pick up the show, and Colbert was given an eight-week tryout. Following the show's immediate success, the show \\"quickly became a fixture in the late-night lineup.\\" At its peak, the show averaged 1.5 million viewers each evening.  The fictional Colbert anchorman character became gradually toned down over the course of the show's run, as the host believed he would eventually need to move beyond it. He began to regard it as an act of discipline to perform as the character; he later remarked, \\"to model behavior, you have to consume that behavior on a regular basis. It became very hard to watch punditry of any kind, of whatever political stripe.\\" With his contract set to end in December 2014, he had already decided to leave the show when he was contacted by CBS to replace David Letterman as the host of its Late Show franchise. The show's ending was announced concurrently with Colbert's jump to CBS in April 2014. The last episode aired on December 18, 2014.

Many polychaetes have a muscular pharynx that can be everted (turned inside out to extend it). In these animals the foremost few segments often lack septa so that, when the muscles in these segments contract, the sharp increase in fluid pressure from all these segments everts the pharynx very quickly. Two families, the Eunicidae and Phyllodocidae, have evolved jaws, which can be used for seizing prey, biting off pieces of vegetation, or grasping dead and decaying matter. On the other hand, some predatory polychaetes have neither jaws nor eversible pharynges. Selective deposit feeders generally live in tubes on the sea-floor and use palps to find food particles in the sediment and then wipe them into their mouths. Filter feeders use \\"crowns\\" of palps covered in cilia that wash food particles towards their mouths. Non-selective deposit feeders ingest soil or marine sediments via mouths that are generally unspecialized. Some clitellates have sticky pads in the roofs of their mouths, and some of these can evert the pads to capture prey.

Passage 1:Hibbard made his Broadway debut in Cats in 1993 in the role of the Rum Tum Tugger at the Winter Garden Theatre. Next was a Once Upon A Mattress revival in the role of the Jester, starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Jane Krakowski, which opened on December 19, 1996, at the Broadhurst Theatre and ran for 188 performances. Hibbard originated the role of Bobby/Michael Bennett in A Class Act. The musical was initially produced Off-Broadway by Manhattan Theatre Club opening on October 3, 2000, and running until December 10, 2000. A Class Act transferred to the Ambassador Theatre on Broadway, where it opened on March 11, 2001, and ran for 30 previews and 105 regular performances. Hibbard replaced Michael McGrath in Monty Python's Spamalot in the role of Patsy, singing \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\". Hibbard joined the Broadway production of Billy Elliot The Musical in June 2009 and later toured the US in the second national tour. David was in the 2012-2013 production of in the role of Matthews. Most recently David was seen in Something Rotten!, an original musical comedy with a book by John O'Farrell and Karey Kirkpatrick and music and lyrics by Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick. Here, David understudied four roles; Nick Bottom, Nostradamus, Shylock and Lord Clapham, in addition to performing in the ensemble nightly.Something Rotten! opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre in previews on March 23, 2015, and officially opened on April 22, 2015. It was nominated for ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and won one (Christian Borle as Best Featured Actor in a Musical). Its cast album received a nomination for the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.\\n Passage 2:In 1997, Compton signed up with a new team, Impact Motorsports, to run the No. 86 Ford F-150 for the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Rookie of the Year Award. During his initial Truck Series season, Compton had three Top 5 finishes and a 13th-place finish in points, but fell well short of the top rookie award. For the 1998 season, in the third race of the season held at Phoenix International Raceway, Compton won his first career pole position, and finished in third in the race. The next week at Portland Speedway, he led all but two laps and won his first career Truck Series race. He got another win later that season at Heartland Park Topeka. He finished seventh in the final points standings and was named the Most Popular Driver. Compton had high hopes for 1999 season as Impact switched to Dodge Rams and getting a teammate in Randy Tolsma, but he failed to go to victory lane that season, although he did finish fourth in the points. Late that season, Compton began competing in some Winston Cup races for Melling Racing. Soon afterwards, Melling announced that Compton would driver theirNo. 9 Ford Taurus in the Winston Cup Series in 2000 season.\\n Passage 3:The same year, Krichell went to Hartford, Connecticut to sign shortstop Leo Durocher for a $7,500 bonus ($ in 2010). When the deal was concluded, Barrow sent Krichell to Salt Lake City to watch young second baseman Tony Lazzeri, who played for the Salt Lake Bees of the Pacific Coast League and hit 60 home runs and achieved over 200 RBIs the previous season. The Bees were asking for $50,000 ($ in 2010), but several scouts placed his value ten times lower. The Chicago Cubs were given the option to sign him for a discounted rate, but declined because he had epilepsy. Krichell saw promise in the player and convinced Barrow to buy him. Around the same time, he helped acquire shortstop Mark Koenig from the Minneapolis Millers. These Krichell signings formed part of the 1927 New York Yankees team, considered by many to be the greatest team ever assembled. Four of the starters in this squad were signed by Krichell, including three-quarters of its infield and Mike Gazella, its main backup, who signed for $500 in 1923 ($ in 2010). The Yankees took just four games to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates and win the 1927 World Series.","target":"2","rationale":"The question asks for information about when Compton won his first career Truck Series race.

Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted.\\nIn December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire.

The Lions took an early lead when Eric Ebron caught a 33-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford for the only points of the first quarter. The Bengals' Randy Bullock kicked a pair of field goals in the second quarter, from 29-yards and 27-yards, respectively, to make the score 7-6 in favor of Detroit at half-time. The Lions extended their lead in the third quarter when Matt Prater kicked a 23-yard field goal, but then the Bengals took their first lead of the game when C. J. Uzomah caught a one-yard touchdown pass from Andy Dalton. In the fourth quarter the Bengals extended their lead when Bullock scored another field goal from 35-yards out, then Detroit's Tion Green ran in a touchdown from five-yards out to give the Lions a 17-16 lead. However, Cincinnati regained the lead when they added ten more points with a 51-yard field goal from Bullock and a 12-yard touchdown run from Giovani Bernard to make the final score 26-17 in favor of the Bengals. With the loss, the Lions were eliminated from playoff contention.\\n\\nHow many more field goals did Randy Bullock have in the game than Matt Prater?","target":"3","rationale":"To solve this problem, we first need to count how many field goals each player got.

He was nicknamed \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" and \\"Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology\\" and later, \\"Scientist of the Seas\\" for his extensive works in his books, especially The Physical Geography of the Sea (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea.\\nContext: The war brought ruin to many in Fredericksburg, where Maury's immediate family lived. Thus, returning there was not immediately considered. After the war, after serving Maximilian in Mexico as \\"Imperial Commissioner of Immigration\\" and building Carlotta and New Virginia Colony for displaced Confederates and immigrants from other lands, Maury accepted a teaching position at the Virginia Military Institute, holding the chair of physics.  Maury advocated the creation of an agricultural college to complement the institute. That led to the establishment of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia, in 1872. Maury declined the offer to become its first president partly because of his age. He had previously been suggested as president of the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1848 by Benjamin Blake Minor in his publication the Southern Literary Messenger. Maury considered becoming president of St. John's College in Annapolis Maryland, the University of Alabama, and the University of Tennessee. It appears that he preferred being close to General Robert E. Lee in Lexington from statements that Maury made in letters. Maury served as a pall bearer for Lee.  During his time at Virginia Military Institute, Maury wrote a book, entitled The Physical Geography of Virginia. He had once been a gold mining superintendent outside Fredericksburg and had studied geology intensely during that time and so was well equipped to write such a book. During the Civil War, more battles took place in Virginia than in any other state (Tennessee was second), and Maury's aim was to assist wartorn Virginia in discovering and extracting minerals, improving farming and whatever else could assist it to rebuild after such a massive destruction.  Maury later gave talks in Europe about co-operation on a weather bureau for land, just as he had charted the winds and predicted storms at sea many years before. He gave the speeches until his last days, when he collapsed giving a speech. He went home after he recovered and told Ann Hull Herndon-Maury, his wife, \\"I have come home to die.\\"\\nQuestion: Was his career over after that?.

Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \`\`dairy bull'' or a \`\`beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age. A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months.

Robert is young, while Michael is middle-aged.\\n\\nHint: For autosomal dominant disorders, a person with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to their offspring. For achondroplasia, this means there will be a 50% chance that each child will have achondroplasia. Since two copies are fatal, if two people with achondroplasia have a child, there is a 25% chance of the child dying shortly after birth, a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, and a 25% chance the child will have a normal phenotype. However, in 3 out of 4 cases, people with achondroplasia are born to parents who don't have the condition. This is the result of a new mutation. New achondroplasis mutations are associated with increasing paternal age (over 35 years). Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis. More than 98% of achondroplasia is caused by a G to A point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the FGFR3 gene, which causes a glycine to arginine substitution. This makes this particular nucleotide one of the most, if not the most, mutable base in the human genome.","target":"Michael","rationale":"Robert and Michael are both hoping to become fathers for the first time soon.

Taylor shouts to Zach Avery (Brandon Glow), \\"Cross the Thirty!\\" He wants his offense to get within good field-goal position.

So ends the game, and another losing season--Taylor's sixth in a row.The 2003 season begins with some dire news: Darrin, the Eagles' top scorer in 2002, has moved in with his father so he can transfer to the rival Tucker school. Taylor's offensive and defensive co-ordinators, J. T. Hawkins (Chris Willis) and Brady Owens (Tracy Goode), break it to him. He then has to break it to his players, who of course take it very badly.When Grant drives home, his car dies after he barely gets off the road. His house has a very bad smell, which neither he nor his wife Brooke (Shannen Fields) can figure out. THeir evening meal will be cold, because their stove does not work. And their combined salaries ($24,000 a year for Grant, and the $6,000 that Brooke makes in the local florist's shop) will not let them improve their situation. And to top it all, Brooke desperately wants to be pregnant, and yet again takes a home pregnancy test, finds it negative, and carelessly leaves the test kit for Grant to find.In the next scene, sportscaster Alicia Houston (Erin Catt) reports on this year's defending champions, the Richland Giants.

Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent.

This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by Abraxas and Santana III. Lineup changes were common.\\n\\nThe follow-up to Supernatural came three years later and was highly anticipated by international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, Shaman was released worldwide. Although it initially sold briskly (298,973 copies in the US in its first week) and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off and it soon slid down the charts. Despite this, it went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, \\"The Game of Love\\", which featured vocals from Michelle Branch, debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, \\"Why Don't You & I\\", featuring the vocals of Alex Band, reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound.  With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw the release of 2005's All That I Am. The album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. The album, a continuation of the Latin-rock influenced sound of Shaman, achieved gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, 2010's Guitar Heaven. Musically it was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong heavy metal influences. It debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status.

Caterpillars emerge from the eggs and eat for 10 to 12 days before forming chrysalides. Adult butterflies emerge from the chrysalides in 7 to 10 days. In this post, I’m going to explain some of the most unknown facts about how long do butterflies live in captivity and in the wild. A butterfly is a flying insect that belongs to the Lepidoptera order along with the moths and butterflies. The Brimstone butterfly (Gonepterix rhamni) has the longest lifetime of the adult butterflies: 9-10 months. Some Case Moth caterpillars (Psychidae) build a case around themselves that they always carry with them. Q. How does a monarch butterfly know how to fly right away when it hatches out of its chrysalis? A. Instinct. Unlike humans, insects don't have to learn much. They are genetically programmed to do things like fly, find food, and migrate (in the case of monarchs). In some ways, this sounds like a great thing. Monarchs (Danaus plexippus) and Swallowtails may live about a month in the summer, but the Monarchs that migrate to Mexico or to the California coast may live up to six months. Some long-lived tropical butterflies live up to six months as adults. The long-life champion is a tiny yucca moth that feeds on Banana Yucca (Yucca baccata). Dr. In fact, four individual butterflies constitute the four generations that go through the said four phases in the span of one year, and then they start the process afresh starting with the first stage and first generation. 1 What Do Praying Mantis Eat | Praying Mantis Diet. 2  Peacock Butterfly Facts | Anatomy, Diet, Habitat, Behavior. 3  Pond Snail Facts | Anatomy, Diet, Habitat, Behavior. 4  Black Swallowtail Butterfly Facts | Anatomy, Diet, Habitat, Behavior. 5  Karner Blue Butterfly Facts | Anatomy, Diet, Habitat, Reproduction. Also fall-hatched monarch butterflies migrate south in fall and northward in spring. Adults of these species may survive for 8-9 months or longer. Total Life Span Although larvae eat only milkweed, adult monarchs feed on the nectar of many plants including: 1  Apocynum cannabinum – Indian hemp. 2  Asclepias sp. – milkweeds. 3  Aster sp. – asters. 4  Cirsium sp. – thistles. 5  Daucus carota – wild carrot. 6  Dipsacus sylvestris – teasel. 7  Echinacea sp. – coneflowers. 8  Erigeron canadensis – horseweed. The chrysalis is simply the word for the butterfly during the pupa stage. The outside of the chrysalis is the exoskeleton, or skin, of the pupa. When it becomes time for the larva (caterpillar) to become a chrysalis, the caterpillar spins a silk button from which it hangs.

The effect of LH/hCG on luteal blood flow, however, is unknown. This work studies the effect of hCG on both luteal and ovarian blood flows at different stages of pseudopregnancy in adult female rats. Pseudopregnancy was induced by mating with sterile male rats. The length of pseudopregnancy was 13 +/- 1 days and, during this time, blood flow was measured by the injection of radioactive microspheres during anesthesia. At autopsy, the corpora lutea were identified and extirpated under a stereomicroscope. These, and the remaining ovary, were then counted for radioactivity and the blood flow was calculated. Progesterone levels were determined in plasma and ovarian tissues. Furthermore, the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase was tested in ovarian tissues at day 6 of pseudopregnancy. An intraarterial injection of hCG (50 IU) or vehicle (saline) was given 20 min before the blood flow determinations in anesthetized rats. The luteal blood flow was not changed by hCG on days 2, 6, and 11 of pseudopregnancy, whereas in the remaining ovary the blood flow increased more than 2-fold, thereby resulting in redistribution of the blood flow. Ten micrograms of NIH-LH-B9, tested at day 6 of pseudopregnancy, mimicked the effect of hCG. At day 6 of pseudopregnancy, hCG (50 IU) was given ip to conscious rats 200 min and 24 h before blood flow determinations. At 200 min after hCG there was a more pronounced redistribution of ovarian blood flow with a 45% reduction in luteal blood flow and a 4-fold increase in flow through the remaining ovary. LH as well as hCG doubled the progesterone content of the remaining ovary. In the corpora lutea an increased progesterone content was seen after 200 min of hCG exposure. At 24 h after hCG injection, all parameters had returned to control levels except that adenylate cyclase was nonresponsive. The increase in the total ovarian blood flow coincides with the increased steroidogenesis and these effects are likely due to release of metabolites and/or vasoactive substances. Despite this increase, the blood flow of the corpus luteum was not increased rendering vascular mechanisms unlikely as a part of the acute LH/hCG effects on corpus luteum of pseudopregnancy. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract contains many numerical values that correspond to measurements of blood flow, progesterone levels, and other parameters.

Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero.

An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or androgynous, and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the \\"gender-conforming heterosexual\\" and the \\"gender-nonconforming homosexual\\" as negative stereotypes.

Despite limited commercial success, The Birthday Party's influence has been far-reaching, and they have been called \\"one of the darkest and most challenging post-punk groups to emerge in the early '80s.\\" The group's \\"bleak and noisy soundscapes,\\" which drew irreverently on blues, free jazz, and rockabilly, provided the setting for vocalist Nick Cave's disturbing tales of violence and perversion. Their music has been described by critic Simon Reynolds as gothic, and their single \\"Release the Bats\\" was particularly influential on the emerging gothic scene.\\n\\nThe Boys Next Door's best known song, \\"Shivers\\", written by Howard, and first performed and recorded by his band The Young Charlatans, was banned by radio stations because of a reference to suicide. After recordings and moderate success in Australia (including hundreds of live shows) they headed for London in 1980, changed their name to The Birthday Party and launched into a period of innovative and aggressive music-making. Some sources say the band took its new name from the Harold Pinter play The Birthday Party; others (including Ian Johnston's Cave biography) state it was prompted by Cave misremembering, or intentionally misattributing, the name to a non-existent birthday party scene in the Dostoyevsky novel Crime and Punishment. In a 2008 interview, Rowland S. Howard gave his own recollection: \\"The name The Birthday Party came up in conversation between Nick and myself. There's this apocryphal story about it coming from a Dostoyevsky novel. It may have had various connotations, but what he and I spoke about was a sense of celebration and making things into more an occasion and ritual\\". They resided in London, with trips back to Australia and tours through Europe and the U.S. before relocating to West Berlin in 1982.  Above the barely-controlled racket, Cave's vocals ranged from desperate to simply menacing and demented. Critics have written that \\"neither John Cale nor Alfred Hitchcock was ever this scary,\\" and that Cave \\"doesn't so much sing his vocals as expel them from his gut\\". Though Cave drew on earlier rock and roll shriekers--especially Iggy Pop and Suicide's Alan Vega--his singing with the Birthday Party remains powerful and distinct. His lyrics also drew on Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire.  The single \\"Release the Bats\\" came out during the emergence of the gothic scene. This song about \\"vampire sex\\" was promoted by an advertisement with the words \\"Dirtiness is next to antigodliness\\".

Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\\n\\n- Luis Alcoriza de la Vega (September 5, 1918  December 3, 1992) was a respected Mexican screenwriter, film director, and actor.\\n\\n- A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.\\n\\n- Tlayucan is a 1962 Mexican comedy film directed by Luis Alcoriza and based on a novel by Jesús Murciélago Velázquez . It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film .\\n\\n- Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor.\\n\\n- Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.\\n\\n- A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\\n\\n- An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film is one of the Academy Awards handed out annually by the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).

To determine whether pinacidil's metabolism or effects were influenced by either liver disease or the subject's debrisoquin phenotype, eight patients with chronic stable cirrhosis and 13 healthy subjects were studied. Seven of the healthy volunteers were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin, whereas six were of the poor metabolizer phenotype. Neither the clearance of pinacidil nor the production of the N-oxide was altered by the subjects' debrisoquin phenotype. Cirrhosis produced a 50% reduction in pinacidil's clearance (20.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 42.1 +/- 5.1 L/hr; P less than 0.0005) and a prolongation in the elimination t1/2 from 3.9 +/- 0.3 to 6.1 +/- 0.6 hours (P less than 0.01).

I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now and there have been a string of issues that make me feel like or relationship will only ever be temporary.

Which brings me to the incident...\\n\\nLast summer we were separated for 2 months due to working in different places.  We agreed before hand that if she did anything with someone else, we would follow boundaries and she'd tell me beforehand.  She did not do anything for 7 weeks but then at a party, she got cuddly with a co-worker and they ended up exchanging oral.  Pretty much they cuddled, he fingered her and she blew him.  Though this bothered me immensely, what hurt me the most was that I was trying to contact her through the party and she never responded until afterwards when she told me she did this with another guy.  It was honestly the worst I've ever felt.\\n\\nWe talked about it and she claimed she didn't consider it sex so she didn't know she should have checked up with me.  But what bothered me was she was outright ignoring me and I saw it as an act of cheating.  However I buried these insecurities and have been with her for another 4 months with no problems.\\n\\nBut I still think about this a lot and I could never see myself spending my life with her because of it.

The amount of available space for airflow determines whether air acts as an insulator or conductor. The space between the inside and outside walls of a house, for example, is about 9 cm (3.5 in) —large enough for convection to work effectively. The addition of wall insulation prevents airflow, so heat loss (or gain) is decreased. Similarly, the gap between the two panes of a double-paned window is about 1 cm, which prevents convection and takes advantage of air’s low conductivity to prevent greater loss. Fur, fiber, and fiberglass also take advantage of the low conductivity of air by trapping it in spaces too small to support convection, as shown in the figure.

She has always been more mature than her friends and honestly that gave me and her immediate family a lot of hope. She had a few little mess ups including a pregnancy scare last year that I helped her with; got her a test, and when it was negative I took her to get condoms and told her that if she ever, EVER needed condoms or to get birth control to *call me* because I would postmates her some condoms or take her to planned parenthood for BC myself.

And I’m livid about it. She has no right to ask them to do that all over again. They are in their 70s at this point and her bio parents aren’t in any shape to help her with an infant either. I think she’s being incredibly stupid, selfish and short sighted, and I don’t know if she gets that she’s putting another child in the same position as she was as an infant. It’s infuriating. As a result I told my family I’m not supporting her. I’m not going to a baby shower, I’m not congratulating her, I’m not having anything to do with her anymore.

With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track.

Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections.

Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length, including his failure to take communion, his blasphemous remarks, and his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including jokes about the implausibility of the Resurrection. They commented on the paucity of John's charitable donations to the church. Historian Frank McLynn argues that John's early years at Fontevrault, combined with his relatively advanced education, may have turned him against the church. Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported John's personal interest in the life of St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with Hugh of Lincoln, who was later declared a saint. Financial records show a normal royal household engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances – albeit with many records showing John's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance.

Sultan Murad I took Adrianople from the Byzantines in 1362; Sofia fell in 1382, followed by Shumen in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. The Russian Empire also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774.\\nThe Western European Enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of Bulgaria.

Spanning a land mass of 238,535 km², Ghana is bordered by the Ivory Coast in the west, Burkina Faso in the north, Togo in the east and the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean in the south. \\"Ghana\\" means \\"Warrior King\\" in the Soninke language.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- The Bandama River is the longest river in Côte d'Ivoire with a length of some 800 kilometers . The south - flowing river is fed by the Marahoué , Solomougou , Kan and Nzi rivers and empties into the Tagba Lagoon and the Gulf of Guinea . The Bandama flows through Lake Kossou , a large artificial lake created in 1973 by the construction of the Kossou Dam at Kossou . Yamoussoukro , the capital of Côte d'Ivoire , is located adjacent from the Bandama River .\\n\\n- Longitude (or , Australian and British also ), is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface. It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in degrees and denoted by the Greek letter lambda (). Meridians (lines running from the North Pole to the South Pole) connect points with the same longitude. By convention, one of these, the Prime Meridian, which passes through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England, was allocated the position of zero degrees longitude. The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian, ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to +180° eastward and 180° westward. Specifically, it is the angle between a plane containing the Prime Meridian and a plane containing the North Pole, South Pole and the location in question. (This forms a right-handed coordinate system with the axis (right hand thumb) pointing from the Earth's center toward the North Pole and the axis (right hand index finger) extending from Earth's center through the equator at the Prime Meridian.)\\n\\n- Cape Lopez is a 55 km-long peninsula on the coast of west central Africa, in the country of Gabon. It separates the Gulf of Guinea from the South Atlantic Ocean,\\n\\n- In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth.\\nApproximations employed.\\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.\\n\\n- Gabon, officially the Gabonese Republic, is a sovereign state on the west coast of Central Africa.

Classical Palmyra had a distinctive culture, based on a local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome. To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or in addition to a second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a \\"boule\\" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.\\nThe culture of Persia influenced Palmyrene military tactics, dress and court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern cities such as Edessa or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was Cassius Longinus.Palmyra had a large agora. However, unlike the Greek Agoras (public gathering places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used in some of the tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar to that used in Ancient Egypt.","target":"Eastern caravanserai","rationale":"The agoras of the city that had a culture based on local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome more closely resembled Eastern caravanserai."},{"source":"Read the article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: Who give us life,raise us and are our constant support and wellwishers?Our mothers.That's why millions of people across the world take Mother's Day as an opportunity to express thanks and send best wishes to their moms.\\nHowever,the celebration of Mother's Day is not the recent thing that many believe it to be.It was the ancient Greeks who started the tradition by celebrating their annual spring festival in honor of Rhea,the mother of many gods and goddesses.\\nLater,in the 1600s,Mothering Sunday came to be celebrated in England.On the fourth Sunday of Lent  ,children brought flowers and special fruitcakes to show their respect for their mothers.It may be the root of the modern Mother's Day.\\nThanks to the great efforts of Julia Ward Howe and Anna Jarvis,Mother's Day became an official festival in the US.It is celebrated on the second Sunday in May.Later,many countries began to celebrate this day as Mother's Day.\\nToday,Mother's Day is an international festival honoring mothers.It is celebrated all over the world in different ways.In Western countries,the most common way is to treat mothers with breakfast in bed.Kids often allow their mothers to sleep till late in the morning while they prepare her favorite breakfast with their fathers.Some also make handmade gifts or buy beautiful carnations  .It is the day when you acknowledge your mothers contribution in your life and pay a tribute   to her,often with flowers and gifts.It complements Father's Day,the celebration honoring fathers.\\nToday,Mother's Day is a day celebrated on various days in many places around the world.\\nQuestion: The passage mainly wants to tell us  _  .\\nOptions: A: how to celebrate Mother's day\\nB: what to do on Mother's day\\nC: the historical change of Mother's day\\nD: the meaning of Mother's day","target":"C","rationale":"The passage mainly discusses the history of Mother's Day as an international holiday.

They included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term (193337) of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The programs were in response to the Great Depression, and focused on what historians refer to as the \\"3 Rs\\", Relief, Recovery, and Reform: relief for the unemployed and poor, recovery of the economy to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression.\\n\\n- Natural Resources is a soul album released by Motown girl group Martha Reeves and the Vandellas in 1970 on the Gordy (Motown) label. The album is significant for the Vietnam War ballad \\"I Should Be Proud\\" and the slow jam, \\"Love Guess Who\\". The album marked a return from lead singer Martha Reeves, recovering from a time in a mental institution after an addiction to painkillers nearly wrecked her (though it still took her until 1977 to beat her addiction). This was the next-to-last album for the Vandellas, whose success had peaked in the mid-1960s.\\n\\n- A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.\\n\\n- Robert Fechner (22 March 1876  31 December 1939) was a national labor union leader and director of the Civilian Conservation Corps (193339), which played a central role in the development of state and national parks in the United States. Born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. With only a public school elementary education he had risen to become an American labor union leader and vice president of the International Association of Machinists. He had a reputation for fairness, tact, and patience in all his dealings. On 5 April 1933 he was appointed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to be the Director of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It was Fechner's fairness and ability for organization and administration that impressed the president to his appointment as director. Although he had been an important labor figure, Fechner objected to attempts of union organizers to form unions among CCC enrollees in the camps. He felt that the government was doing all it possibly could for the well-being of the enrollees: well fed, supporting dependents with monthly earnings, getting an education; and they were contributing in a constructive manner to the conservation needs of the nation. The need for a union in this situation was not necessary, and he issued orders to keep union organizers out of the CCC camps and gave instructions that if any of the CCC enrolees joined a union they were to be discharged. Upon Fechner's death while still serving as CCC Director he was succeeded by James McEntee.\\n\\n- Franklin Delano Roosevelt (his own pronunciation, or ; January 30, 1882  April 12, 1945), commonly known as FDR, was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd President of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945. \\n\\n- British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. \\nBritish Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.\\n\\n- Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity.

They span the border between the Canadian province of British Columbia and the U.S. state of Washington and are officially named in the U.S. and Canada as the Cascade Mountains. The portion in Canada is known to Americans as the Canadian Cascades, a designation that also includes the mountains above the east bank of the Fraser Canyon as far north as the town of Lytton, at the confluence of the Thompson and Fraser Rivers.\\n\\n- North Cascades National Park is a U.S. National Park located in the state of Washington. The park is the largest of the three National Park Service units that comprise the North Cascades National Park Service Complex. Several national wilderness areas and British Columbia parkland adjoin the National Park. The park features rugged mountain peaks and protects portions of the North Cascades range.\\n\\n- The Great Depression began in August 1929, when the United States economy first went into an economic recession. Although the country spent two months with declining GDP, it was not until the Wall Street Crash in October 1929 that the effects of a declining economy were felt, and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued. The market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement. Although its causes are still uncertain and controversial, the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future.\\n\\n- The Civilian Conservation Corps (\\"CCC\\") was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men from relief families as part of the New Deal. Originally for young men ages 1825, it was eventually expanded to young men ages 1728. Robert Fechner was the head of the agency. It was a major part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal that provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state and local governments. The CCC was designed to provide jobs for young men, and to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the Great Depression in the United States. At the same time, it implemented a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory. Maximum enrollment at any one time was 300,000. Over the course of its nine years in operation, 3 million young men participated in the CCC, which provided them with shelter, clothing, and food, together with a small wage of $30 (about $547 in 2015) a month ($25 of which had to be sent home to their families).\\n\\n- The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all U.S. national parks, many American national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations. It was created on August 25, 1916, by Congress through the National Park Service Organic Act and is an agency of the United States Department of the Interior.

Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.With the death of Zhengde and ascension of Jiajing, the politics at court shifted in favor of the Neo-Confucian establishment which not only rejected the Portuguese embassy of Fernão Pires de Andrade (d. 1523), but had a predisposed animosity towards Tibetan Buddhism and lamas. Evelyn S. Rawski, a professor in the Department of History of the University of Pittsburgh, writes that the Ming's unique relationship with Tibetan prelates essentially ended with Jiajing's reign while Ming influence in the Amdo region was supplanted by the Mongols.The Chinese Ming dynasty also deliberately helped to propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. The Ming assisted Altan Khan, King of the Tümed Mongols, when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism.Meanwhile, the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region (modern Qinghai), raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan (1507–1582). Klieger writes that Altan Khan's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet. After Altan Khan made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he invited the third hierarch of the Gelug—Sönam Gyatso (1543–1588)—to meet him in Amdo (modern Qinghai) in 1578, where he...","target":"Altan Khan","rationale":"In this article, the full name of Altan Khan is given in one instance.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459).

However, due to increased test-time cost (for ensembles) and increased complexity of the training pipeline (for distillation), these techniques are challenging to use in industrial settings. In this paper we explore a variant of distillation which is relatively straightforward to use as it does not require a complicated multi-stage setup or many new hyperparameters. Our first claim is that online distillation enables us to use extra parallelism to fit very large datasets about twice as fast. Crucially, we can still speed up training even after we have already reached the point at which additional parallelism provides no benefit for synchronous or asynchronous stochastic gradient descent. Two neural networks trained on disjoint subsets of the data can share knowledge by encouraging each model to agree with the predictions the other model would have made. These predictions can come from a stale version of the other model so they can be safely computed using weights that only rarely get transmitted. Our second claim is that online distillation is a cost-effective way to make the exact predictions of a model dramatically more reproducible. We support our claims using experiments on the Criteo Display Ad Challenge dataset, ImageNet, and the largest to-date dataset used for neural language modeling, containing $6\\\\times 10^{11}$ tokens and based on the Common Crawl repository of web data.","target":"We perform large scale experiments to show that a simple online variant of distillation can help us scale distributed neural network training to more machines","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe perform large scale experiments to show that a simple online variant of distillation can help us scale distributed neural network training to more machines."},{"source":"If \\"Fred is the only man alive who still remembers my father as an infant.

Argonne National Laboratory's Experimental Breeder Reactor I, located at the Atomic Energy Commission's National Reactor Testing Station near Arco, Idaho, became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 December 1951. Initially, four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor, but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility (later, the town of Arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by BORAX-III, another reactor designed and operated by Argonne National Laboratory). The world's first commercial scale nuclear power station, Obninsk in the Soviet Union, began generation with its reactor AM-1 on 27 June 1954. Other early nuclear power plants were Calder Hall in England, which began generation on 17 October 1956, and the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, which began on 26 May 1958.

These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4]","target":"Joseph","rationale":"There are many different types of squash balls that have varying levels of hardness, weight and size. The properties (weight, softness) determine the speed and bouncing amplitude/number of bounces when it hits an object.

Total collagen content (as indicated by hydroxyproline concentration) increased with age, and the proportion of the collagen that could be solubilized by any enzyme treatment decreased. The type IV collagen concentration increased significantly with age, whereas the laminin concentration tended to decrease. In the one case of a type I diabetic the amounts of both antigens exceeded those in the age matched controls. In four type II diabetics the results were comparable with those for other aged cases. The distribution of the proteins was studied using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. The staining intensity and thickness of both antigens increased with age in the mesangium and Bowmans capsules, the change in type IV collagen staining being more evident. In diabetic patients these changes were more pronounced and other basement membranes appeared thicker in the stainings.

The ethico-legal concepts and exhortations dealing with righteous conduct are linked to a profound awareness of God, thereby emphasizing the importance of faith, accountability, and the belief in each human's ultimate encounter with God. People are invited to perform acts of charity, especially for the needy. Believers who \\"spend of their wealth by night and by day, in secret and in public\\" are promised that they \\"shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve\\". It also affirms family life by legislating on matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance. A number of practices, such as usury and gambling, are prohibited.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.\\n\\nParagraph: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest.

His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.\\nLess is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.\\nLochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period.

At the end of October 1685, La Salle decided to undertake a longer expedition and reloaded the Belle with many of the remaining supplies. He took 50 men, plus the Belle's crew of 27 sailors, leaving behind 34 men, women, and children. Most of the men traveled with La Salle in canoes, while the Belle followed further off the coast. After three days of travel, they learned of hostile Native Americans in the area. Twenty of the Frenchmen attacked the Native American village, where they found Spanish artifacts. Several of the men died on this expedition from eating prickly pear. The Karankawa killed a small group of the men who had camped on shore, including the captain of the Belle.From January until March 1686, La Salle and most of his men searched overland for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas. The men questioned the local Native American tribes, asking for information on the locations of the Spaniards and the Spanish mines, offering gifts, and telling stories that portrayed the Spanish as cruel and the French as benevolent. When the group returned, they were unable to find the Belle where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.The following month they traveled east, hoping to locate the Mississippi and return to Canada. During their travels, the group encountered the Caddo, who gave the Frenchmen a map depicting their territory, that of their neighbors, and the location of the Mississippi River. The Caddo often made friendship pacts with neighboring peoples and extended their policy of peaceful negotiation to the French.

Find small things your kids can do, like creating centerpieces or paper rings, and direct their creations. Be sure to put these things out where people can see them when they come over, because there's nothing worse than creating something you're proud of and having it hidden. Let them show your guests what they've made and talk about it. They'll be happy to do so!\\nWhat is a better way to get into the spirit of the season than to go shopping? Kids love to pick out gifts for others. Let them choose whatever they think the person they're buying for would like. This will help them to be proud of their gifts, as well as try to budget according to the amount of money you have given them. You can also let them pack their own gifts. Give them options of gift bags or packing paper and watch them go to town. It may not be perfect, but it will be precious, for sure.\\nKids love to cook. They love to get their hands dirty and create fun meals with the help of their parents. They also feel a sense of pride in the food items they create, and they love it when people eat what they make and talk about how delicious it is.

The first church on the site was established in the 7th century by St Nidan, the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, Anglesey, but the oldest parts of the present structure, which is now closed and partly in ruins, date from the 14th century.  In about 1500 the church was enlarged by the addition of a second nave on the north side, separated from the earlier nave by an arcade of six arches.  Between 1839 and 1843 a new church was built nearby to serve the local community, partly due to the cost of repairing the old church. Much of the building was subsequently demolished, leaving only part of the western end and the central arcade.  The decision was condemned at the time by Harry Longueville Jones, a clergyman and antiquarian, who lamented the \\"melancholy fate\\" of what he called \\"one of the largest and most important [churches] in the island of Anglesey\\". Other appreciative comments have been made about the church both before and after its partial demolition.\\nAfter the new church was opened, the old church was used as a chapel for funerals for a time. It has been restored by the owners of the adjoining house, Plas Llanidan, and is occasionally open to the public.

The totipotent stem cell is the zygote, or fertilized egg. The totipotent (toti- = “all”) stem cell gives rise to all cells of the human body. The next level is the pluripotent stem cell, which gives rise to multiple types of cells of the body and some of the supporting fetal membranes. Beneath this level, the mesenchymal cell is a stem cell that develops only into types of connective tissue, including fibrous connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood, but not epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower on the hierarchy of stem cells is the hemopoietic stem cell, or hemocytoblast. All of the formed elements of blood originate from this specific type of cell. Hemopoiesis begins when the hemopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called hemopoietic growth factors, which prompt it to divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hemopoietic stem cell, allowing hemopoiesis to continue. The other daughter cell becomes either of two types of more specialized stem cells (Figure 18.4): • Lymphoid stem cells give rise to a class of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which function in immunity. However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes progresses somewhat differently from the process for the other formed elements. In brief, lymphoid stem cells quickly migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, where their production and differentiation continues. B cells are so named since they mature in the bone marrow, while T cells mature in the thymus. • Myeloid stem cells give rise to all the other formed elements, including the erythrocytes; megakaryocytes that produce platelets; and a myeloblast lineage that gives rise to monocytes and three forms of granular leukocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.\\n\\n\\nQ: Which cell gives rise to all cells of the human body?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- signaler stem cell\\n\\n- omnipoten stem cell\\n\\n- schwann stem cell\\n\\n- totipotent stem cell\\n\\nA:","target":"totipotent stem cell","rationale":"The totipotent stem cell is the zygote, or fertilized egg.

Petro Doroshenko Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, aiming to gain control of Ukraine but facing defeats from other factions struggling over control of that region, in a final bid to preserve his power in Ukraine, signed a treaty with Sultan Mehmed IV in 1669 that recognized the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire.:273 In the meantime, Commonwealth forces were trying to put down unrest in Ukraine, but were weakened by decades long wars ). Trying to capitalize on that weakness, Tatars, who commonly raided across the Commonwealth borders in search of loot and plunder, invaded, this time allying themselves with Cossacks under hetman Doroshenko. They were however stopped by Commonwealth forces under hetman John Sobieski, who stopped their first push , defeating them several times, and finally gaining an armistice after the Battle of Podhajce. In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried once again to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, supportive of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but again like in 1666-67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed. Thus an irregular border conflict escalated into a regular war in 1671, as the Ottoman Empire was now prepared to send its regular units onto the battlefield in a bid to try to gain control of that region for itself.:646\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Currently, a virulent PEDV CH/YNKM-8/2013 and a CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M have been successfully isolated from the clinical samples. To dissect out the underlying pathogenic mechanism of virulent PEDV and clarify the differences between virulent and CV777 vaccine strainlike PEDV infections, we performed an iTRAQ-based comparative quantitative proteomic study of Vero cells infected with both PEDV strains. A total of 661 and 474 differentially expressed proteins were identified upon virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like isolates infection, respectively. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was employed to investigate the canonical pathways and functional networks involved in both PEDV infections. Comprehensive studies have revealed that the PEDV virulent strain suppressed protein synthesis of Vero cells through down-regulating mTOR as well as its downstream targets 4EBP1 and p70S6K activities, which were validated by immunoblotting. In addition, the virulent strain could activate NF-κB pathway more intensively than the CV777 vaccine strain-like isolate, and elicit stronger inflammatory cascades as well. These data might provide new insights for elucidating the specific pathogenesis of PEDV infection, and pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Biological significance: Porcine epidemic diarrhea is now worldwide distributed and causing huge economic losses to swine industry. The immunomodulation and pathogenesis between PEDV and host, as well as the difference between virulent and attenuated strains of PEDV infections are still largely unknown. In this study, we presented for the first application of proteomic analysis to compare whole cellular protein alterations induced by virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infections, which might contribute to understand the pathogenesis of PEDV and anti-viral strategy development.","target":"iTRAQ-based comparative proteomic analysis of Vero cells infected with virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","rationale":"The title should reflect the studies that were performed to investigate virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infections.

After the next three drives ended in punts, with the first half winding down, Tannehill connected with Wallace on a 32-yard touchdown bomb with 0:05 left to trim the score to 14-13 on a play that was initially ruled a drop. After a decent offensive showing in the first half, the Patriots went on a barrage of scoring in the third quarter. After returning the kickoff 19 yards to the 21, the Patriots stormed 79 yards in just 8 plays, increasing their lead to 21-13 on LeGarrette Blount's 3-yard touchdown run. After a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots drove 47 yards to the Dolphins 17 where Gostkowski drilled a 35-yard for goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. Patrick Chung intercepted a pass on the first play of the next drive and returned it 10 yards to the Dolphins 27. The Patriots cashed it in for a touchdown on the first play with Brady air mailing a 27-yard touchdown strike to Rob Gronkowski, upping the lead to 31-13. After another Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots need just three plays to put the game on ice. First Jonas Gray ran for 6 yards to the Dolphins 41, followed by Brady hooking up with Gronkowski for 35 yards to the Patriots 6. Brady then found Edelman for the 6-yard touchdown pass on the next play, making the score 38-13. The Dolphins drove 65 yards in 14 plays to the Patriots 25, but on 4th-and-18, Daniel Thomas could only gain 10 yards and the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots scored the final points on a 36-yarder, making the score 41-13. The Dolphins turned the ball over on downs and the Patriots took a knee to end the game. The Patriots offensive line was immensely better than the opening day game against Miami as Brady wasn't sacked at all. Brady tossed 2 TDs to Edelman and Gronkowski while Vereen and Blount picked up rushing TDs. Gronkowski was their leading receiver with 96 yards and 1 touchdown on just 3 catches, and in the process secured his second 1,000 yard season. Miami picked up 384 yards of offense, but mostly couldn't get out of their own way with two turnovers and some awful drops, including a dropped touchdown by Mike Wallace. With the blowout win, the Patriots improved to 11-3, clinching their 17th AFC East title in franchise history, the 12th in the Brady-Belichick era, and their 6th straight.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"What all field goals did Caleb Sturgis attempt?","rationale":"Here's a question for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: What all field goals did Caleb Sturgis attempt?"},{"source":"In this task, you are given an impractical statement.

Similarities have also been observed within different classes of signals that target proteins to membrane-less subnuclear compartments. Common localization signals affect spatial and temporal subcellular organization and are thought to allow the coordinated response of different molecular networks to a given signaling cue. Here we identify a higher-order and predictive code, {[RR(I/L)X 3 r] (n, n>1) ؉[L(/N)(V/L)] (n,n>1) }, that establishes high-affinity interactions between a group of proteins and the nucleolus in response to a specific signal. This position-independent code is referred to as a nucleolar detention signal regulated by H ؉ (NoDS H؉ ) and the class of proteins includes the cIAP2 apoptotic regulator, VHL ubiquitylation factor, HSC70 heat shock protein and RNF8 transcription regulator.

They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Dan studied genetic engineering.

It now spans video games, trading card games, animated television shows and movies, comic books, and toys. Pokémon is the second best-selling video game franchise, behind only Nintendo's \\"Mario\\" franchise and one of the Highest-Grossing Media franchises of all time.\\n\\n- The original Square Enix Co., Ltd. was formed as the result of a statutory merger between Enix Corporation and Square Co., Ltd. on April 1, 2003, with Enix legally absorbing Square. Each share of Square's common stock was exchanged for 0.85 shares of Enix's common stock. At the time, 80% of Square Enix staff were made up of former Square employees. As part of the merger, former Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed president of the new corporation, while former Enix president Keiji Honda was named its vice president, and the founder of Enix, Yasuhiro Fukushima, the largest shareholder of the combined corporation, became its honorary chairman. As a result of the merger, Square Co., Ltd. was dissolved and Enix was the surviving company. \\n\\n- Gameplay.\\nAlthough there are different features in each of the titles, the major gameplay in each title are the same. The player assumes the role of a Pokémon that was transformed from a human, found by the player's Pokémon partner in the start of the game. Before the game starts, the player will need to go through a personality test; this will decide which Pokémon the player is in the game (with the exception of the WiiWare games, \\"Gates to Infinity\\", and \\"Super Mystery Dungeon\\", where the player may choose their starter). Gameplay is based on a classic roguelike game, with the player navigating the randomly generated dungeon with their Pokémon team. Movement and actions are turn-based; the player can use basic attacks, Pokémon moves, and items. The game starts with one partner Pokémon, but the player can recruit other Pokémon that they meet in the dungeon into their team soon after the first mission.\\n\\n- Although most \\"Final Fantasy\\" installments are stand-alone stories with different settings and main characters, they feature identical elements that define the franchise. Recurring elements include plot themes, character names, and game mechanics. Plots center on a group of heroes battling a great evil while exploring the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, pop culture, and mythologies of cultures worldwide.\\n\\n- Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.\\n\\n- The is an 8-bit handheld video game device with interchangeable cartridges developed and manufactured by Nintendo, which was first released in Japan on , in North America on and in Europe on . It is the first handheld console in the Game Boy line and was created by Satoru Okada and Nintendo Research & Development 1. This same team, led by Gunpei Yokoi at the time, is credited with designing the Game & Watch series as well as several popular games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Redesigned versions were released in 1996 and 1998 in the form of Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Light (Japan only), respectively.\\n\\n- A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it.\\n\\n- A ratite is any of a diverse group of large, flightless birds of the infraclass Palaeognathae. The systematics involved have been in flux. Some sources state that ratites include all the flightless birds of the Palaeognathae; previously, all these birds had been assigned to the order Struthioniformes, which is more recently regarded as containing only the ostrich. The modern bird superorder Palaeognathae consists of ratites and flighted Neotropic tinamous (compare to Neognathae). Unlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum  hence the name from the Latin \\"ratis\\" (for raft). Without this to anchor their wing muscles, they could not fly even if they were to develop suitable wings. Recent research has indicated that ratites are a paraphyletic group; tinamous fall within them, and are the sister group of the extinct moa. This implies that flightlessness is a trait that evolved independently multiple times in different ratite lineages.\\n\\n- The bird order Casuariiformes has four surviving members: the three species of cassowary, and the only remaining species of emu. The emus are classified in the family Dromaiidae, while the cassowaries are all located within the Casuariidae family.\\n\\n- Mystery Dungeon (  Fushigi no Danjon ) is a series of roguelike video games , most of which were developed by Chunsoft ( later Spike Chunsoft ) , but with select titles in the series developed by other companies with Chunsoft 's permission . The series began when co -- creator of Dragon Quest , Koichi Nakamura , was inspired by a fellow developer 's experience with the video game Rogue and a desire to create an original series . The franchise has had games across different platforms , starting on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , and later on , among others , the Game Boy , Nintendo 64 , Game Boy Advance , Nintendo DS , Wii , and the Nintendo 3DS . Original characters include Shiren the Wanderer and his companions . The series has inspired similar titles in Japan , most of which appropriate their games ' mechanics from Mystery Dungeon rather than Rogue itself . The series has had moderate popularity , and has found most of its success with the Torneko no Daibken : Fushigi no Dungeon and Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series , and to a lesser extent the Chocobo games .\\n\\n- Flightless birds are birds that through evolution lost the ability to fly. There are over 60 extant species including the well known ratites (ostrich, emu, cassowary, rhea and kiwi) and penguins. The smallest flightless bird is the Inaccessible Island rail (length 12.5 cm, weight 34.7 g). The largest (both heaviest and tallest) flightless bird, which is also the largest living bird, is the ostrich (2.7 m, 156 kg). Ostriches are farmed for their decorative feathers, meat and their skins, which are used to make leather. \\n\\n- The game's story centers on four youths whose parents were killed during an army invasion by the empire of Palamecia, who are using hellspawn to conquer the world. Three of the four main characters join a rebellion against the empire, embarking on missions to gain new magic and weapons, destroy enemy superweapons, and rescue leading members of the resistance. The Game Boy Advance remake adds a bonus story after the game is completed.\\n\\n- History.\\nPredating the video game company, \\"Game Freak\\" was a self-published video game magazine created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori in the 1980s. Tajiri wrote and edited the text and Sugimori illustrated. Tajiri also used \\"Game Freak\\" as his pen name when he wrote as a freelance writer to publications such as \\"Family Computer Magazine\\" and \\"Famicom Tsshin\\".\\n\\n- A cameo role or cameo appearance (often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts, typically unnamed or appearing as themselves. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake), or renowned people making uncredited appearances.

I trained the current team members and literally wrote the manual; suffice it to say that I know my job. I am known as being meticulous (or anally retentive if you're being more unkind) due to my previous experience working in serious debt and fraud, and that kind of fastodiousness to maintaining spreadsheets, records and paperwork is something that has carried over into my work with this employer.\\n\\nTowards the end of last year, we had a few people leave the team, and because we were so short staffed, it was an incredibly stressful time, where I think everyone's work slipped, including myself. Around the same time we had one of our team members become our manager, leaving our previous team of five go down to two, including me. We have to give customer service to a building of 800, and we were spread very thin, so we have had people on a rotation from other offices and temps helping out where they can which is good, but they still don't know the specifics of the job as much as me, my colleague and my manager. \\n\\nWhen I first started I was given the security portfolio, meaning I manage the organisation of new starters, including their key cards and logging them into our security network. I got to know the archaic system better than anyone else, and I can do anything in this system quicker than you can snap your fingers. This being said, we had a huge influx of new staff towards the end of the year, and I somewhat began to neglect doing this role in as timely a fashion as normal. More urgent tasks came up, and new users weren't getting done as soon as we wanted, much to my chagrin, because you can't just tell someone to go away if they come up to you in person with some urgent issue that needs resolution. This new manager and I didn't get along when we were colleagues, so now she was my manager, she used this to lord over me about petty crap, and this was one thing she had genuine proof I wasn't doing as I should, so she took the whole security portfolio--the thing I know better than everyone else--and gave it to my other remaining colleague, who we'll call Mr Slim. This guy is one of those lads who seems to be able to do anything wrong and is still liked by our manager. He had a habit of just disappearing for hours at a time, would take random smokos all the time and still isn't publically told off for it; I was 10 min late back from an appointment once and I got publically yelled at in front of the team. This is the same guy that openly called someone \\"too Jewish\\"--as a himself a GERMAN. So, admittedly, imo I work with arseholes and I am a bit biased in this situation.\\n\\nFast forward till today. Mr Slim has been managing this security portfolio for about 3 months now, and he was recently away for about three weeks with a mysterious illness which he poorly communicated,  so we were on edge every day not knowing if he was going to be coming in or not until he would finally text our boss. While Mr Slim was gone we found a whole raft of unfinished, badly done or just not attempted work that was assigned to him or he had checked off as having been done. He hadn't been documenting anything correctly, and my beautifully maintained spreadsheets and system of putting together a starter pack was completely ignored and destroyed respectively. There's a whole bunch of stuff still unaccounted for, and the whole team, my manager included, is pretty pissed off at Mr Slim, despite letting a lot of it slide. In response, I'm given back this security stuff to fix as it hugely impacts our customers. Mr Slim is very friendly, and comes off as much more likeable than me (I have Asperger's) and I am aware that it makes his mistakes a lot more palatable than mine.\\n\\nSorry for the long explanation, but my problem is this: right now, whenever I try and do something in the team, Mr Slim jumps in and tries to do it before I can, even when I have said it in my daily outline in our morning meeting. I said I'd train the newbie after lunch? Cool, I come back from lunch to find Mr Slim in the middle of training him. I said I'd collate a whole bunch of data from some emails? The emails start disappearing as I am going through them because he's started doing them too. Boss asks the team to do something and I say I'll do it cos it's in my area of expertise? He tears off after I've already stood up. I've started to get a bit more aggressively assertive with him re why he's doing this, telling Mr Slim it isn't ok for him to just take my work out from under me, but he just laughs it off as if I'm lost in those wily female histrionics again, making vaguely patronising or misogynistic comments to me that I can't actually pin down as either but that make me uncomfortable. I've tried going to my manager, but in her view as long as the work gets done, there shouldn't be any issue. If I defend this, it looks like I'm hoarding work and *don't* want it to get done on time. When I defend my reasons for being thorough in maintaining spreadsheets with complete information and consistent capitalisation in our emails to staff and records, I'm made to feel as if I'm a nagging nancy and that I'm too sensitive. I KNOW I'm better at the job than Mr Slim, and I do take things seriously because I think it is important to doing the job well, especially since I wasn't doing so well last year. I wouldn't mind so much if he would just ask before jumping into doing my work--sometimes I left that email there because I was awaiting more info, not because I was lazy. I have reasons behind what I do, but no one wants to hear it.\\n\\nTL;DR my work colleague jumps in and does the work I have been assigned, my boss doesn't seem to care as long as the jobs get done, and I'm being made to feel like I'm too sensitive for reiterating the importance of accurate record keeping.

To employ rule based sentiment classification, we require sentiment lexicons. However, manual construction of sentiment lexicon is time consuming and costly for resource-limited languages. To bypass manual development time and costs, we tried to build Amharic Sentiment Lexicons relying on corpus based approach. The intention of this approach is to handle sentiment terms specific to Amharic language from Amharic Corpus. Small set of seed terms are manually prepared from three parts of speech such as noun, adjective and verb. We developed algorithms for constructing Amharic sentiment lexicons automatically from Amharic news corpus. Corpus based approach is proposed relying on the word co-occurrence distributional embedding including frequency based embedding (i.e. Positive Point-wise Mutual Information PPMI). First we build word-context unigram frequency count matrix and transform it to point-wise mutual Information matrix. Using this matrix, we computed the cosine distance of mean vector of seed lists and each word in the corpus vocabulary. Based on the threshold value, the top closest words to the mean vector of seed list are added to the lexicon. Then the mean vector of the new sentiment seed list is updated and process is repeated until we get sufficient terms in the lexicon. Using PPMI with threshold value of 100 and 200, we got corpus based Amharic Sentiment lexicons of size 1811 and 3794 respectively by expanding 519 seeds.

The band's music covers a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock. It is known for extensive use of segues in their live performances, and was considered a key part of the re-emerging jam band scene of the 1990s, spearheading the H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival. Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla, and keyboardist Ben Wilson.\\n\\nAfter graduating Princeton High School and moving to New York City, Popper, Hill, and Sheehan enrolled in the music program at The New School while Kinchla attended New York University. After much encouragement by friend David Gonzales, Blues Traveler began playing gigs along the New York-area club circuit, sometimes nightly; the most prominent contract was playing Wednesday nights at a club called the Wetlands. Another bar, The Nightingale, was a regular gig, and later became the setting for the song \\"Defense and Desire\\".  The group shared an apartment on Bergen Street in Brooklyn, New York, along with their high school friend, singer Chris Barron. A second band that Popper and Hill founded, called The Trucking Company, soon became The Spin Doctors with Barron as their frontman. The two groups would often share the stage, playing non-stop concerts of multiple sets. Their first show together was at a Columbia University fraternity party and their second was at a Jamaican-themed restaurant near Times Square in New York City. During this time, Blues Traveler acquired a devout follower, Gina-Z (subject of the band's song \\"Gina\\") who first became an unofficial \\"band mom\\" and later a tour manager, and is involved with the group's business to the present day.  At one New York show they were discovered by an A&M Records talent scout, Patrick Clifford, and the band signed their first recording contract. By 1990 all members had dropped out of college classes. The group also attracted the attention of David Graham, son of the world-famous concert promoter Bill Graham, and became one of Graham's many acts. Blues Traveler then started a relentless touring schedule, expanding their reach up and down the east coast.

The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at the command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalise on this momentum, and most of the offensives came to nothing. The military chain of command functioned relatively well at company and platoon level, but leadership and authority remained weak as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troops.

For the purpose of this story 20M will be A and 20F will be B, and other 20M will be C. \\n\\n\\nWe all moved in together in September but met last year in residence. For a couple months we all lived harmoniously as a friend group, until A and B started having feelings for each other. They had a small fling between Oct-Dec but A ended it because he couldn’t trust her. \\n\\n\\nMyself and C were happy it stopped because we had all agreed last year that we didn’t want to live with a couple and they ended up practically being a couple anyways. A and B remained close but we were a group again. \\n\\n\\nA few weeks ago, A was going downtown to go drinking with his friends from home. B and C were at home for the weekend, so he asked if i wanted to come with him. I’d previously hung out with his friends, so i went and i had a great time. I really clicked with the girls of the group. \\n\\nAround that time, A and B started becoming more than friends again. Now they spend 90% of their time cooped up in his room, they sleep in the same bed every night, and we barely see them. C and i again feel like the group dynamics have changed and we’re spending more time with our other friends. A and B are constantly snapchatting, texting, and talking, meanwhile C and I barely see them. \\n\\nA few days ago A mentioned it was his friend’s birthday and he was going downtown on friends bday to celebrate. I was under the impression that he was going by himself, but it turns out he invited B without asking C or i if we wanted to come too. Now, i get you’re probably going to say that they’re allowed to hangout without us and whatever, but we’re the type of friends who invite each other to things pretty much whenever we go somewhere, and the last time it was one of A’s friend’s birthdays he invited us all to come with him. \\n\\nI’m annoyed because I feel like when A and I went downtown together on our own he was just asking me because B couldn’t go. I also would have liked to see his girl friends again and I don’t know why he wouldn’t want us to come too, plus he and B are just being shady about whether or not they’re a couple. I want to talk to him but I don’t think I can bring it up without sounding like i’m mad that I wasn’t invited. \\n\\nI’m more upset that we explicitly all agreed we didn’t want to live with a couple and they’ve become one and it’s changing our friendships.","target":"no","rationale":"The author of the post is describing a situation in which they feel that their friendship with two other roommates has changed since those roommates began spending more time together, possibly in romantic relationship.

Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu.","target":"Philip the Good","rationale":"The context states that Philip the Good, a patron of Netherlandish illuminators, was an avid collector who possessed over 1000 illuminated books. The text also describes his library as \\"an expression of the man as a Christian prince\\". Based on this information it can be inferred that he had very strong religious beliefs which is supported by similar statements about his piety and learning.\\nHence Philip the Good's full name would have been Phillip IV or V depending on what country in Europe you are from because he lived during Medieval times when people were referred to based off their title rather than given names."},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nParagraph :\\n\\nThe closer the charged objects are, the stronger the electrostatic force.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nRobby noticed a weak electrostatic force between two charged objects.
