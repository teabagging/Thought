Passage:When Epstein's field goal attempt for the 2001 Wolverines was blocked on September 8 with 9:11 remaining against Washington and run back for a touchdown, it gave the Huskies a lead that they would not relinquish on the way to a 23–18 game. Epstein made a 51-yard field goal against Iowa on October 27 to give Michigan a 6-point lead with 3:57 remaining. The 32–26 score held up. He posted a school record 57-yard field goal against Michigan State in the November 3, 2001 Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry game known as Clockgate. However, later in the game, Epstein's short punt and two Michigan penalties, made way for Michigan State's controversial game-winning drive. He made the game-winning 31-yard field goal against the Wisconsin on November 17, 2001 with 10 seconds left. Epstein set up the field goal when his punt bounced off of Badger Brett Bell and was recovered by Brandon Williams with 14 seconds left. In the game 3 of his 8 punts were downed inside the 20 yard line, including a 48-yarder that was downed on the 1-yard-line to set up Michigan's first score. 3 of his 5 kickoffs were touchbacks and a fourth one into the end zone was just returned 15 yards. Epstein's performance earned him Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week recognition and his 8 points (2 FGs and 2 PATs) gave him the team scoring lead with 69 points. He finished the season with 76 points (13–20 FGs and 37–37 PATs) and 71 punts for 2790 yards (39.3 average/17 inside 20). Epstein's single-season punt yardage total was a school record that was surpassed the following season by Adam Finley. His 76 points just edged out B. J. Askew's 72 points and Marquise Walker's 68 points. Epstein earned All-Big Ten Conference second team honors as a placekicker from the coaches and honorable mention honors by both the coaches and media as a punter.

Known for his southern drawl, his characters with a folksy-friendly personality, and his gruff, gregarious voice, Griffith was a Tony Award nominee for two roles, and gained prominence in the starring role in director Elia Kazan's film A Face in the Crowd (1957) before he became better known for his television roles, playing the lead roles of Andy Taylor in the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968) and Ben Matlock in the legal drama Matlock (1986-1995).\\n\\nGriffith's early career was as a monologist, delivering long stories such as What It Was, Was Football, which is told from the point of view of a naive country preacher trying to figure out what was going on in a football game. The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.  Griffith starred in Ira Levin's one-hour teleplay version of No Time for Sergeants (March 1955) -- a story about a country boy in the United States Air Force -- on The United States Steel Hour, a television anthology series. He expanded that role in Ira Levin's full-length theatrical version of the same name (October 1955) on Broadway in New York City. The role earned him a \\"Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor\\" nomination at the 1956 Tony Awards, losing to Ed Begley. He did win the 1956 Theatre World Award, however, a prize given for debut roles on Broadway. \\"Mr. Griffith does not have to condescend to Will Stockdale\\" (his role in the play), wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. \\"All he has to do is walk on the stage and look the audience straight in the face. If the armed forces cannot cope with Will Stockdale, neither can the audience resist Andy Griffith.\\"  Griffith later reprised his role for the film version (1958) of No Time for Sergeants; the film also featured Don Knotts, as a corporal in charge of manual-dexterity tests, marking the beginning of a lifelong association between Griffith and Knotts. No Time for Sergeants is considered the direct inspiration for the later television situation comedy Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.  His only other New York stage appearance was the titular role in the 1959 musical Destry Rides Again, co-starring Dolores Gray. The show, with a score by Harold Rome, ran for 472 performances and more than a year. Griffith was nominated for \\"Distinguished Musical Actor\\" at the 1960 Tony Awards, losing to Jackie Gleason.  He also portrayed a US Coast Guard sailor in the feature film Onionhead (1958); it was neither a critical nor a commercial success.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Andy Griffith","rationale":"The context clearly mentions the name of a famous American actor, comedian and television producer: Andy Griffith.\\nIn addition to that, it also provides details about his early career as an entertainer such as monologues performed by him which were later released in record labels or broadcast on TV."},{"source":"Hostess is betting on a sweet comeback for Twinkies when they return to shelves next month.

He served as the head football coach at Oberlin College, Buchtel College (now known as the University of Akron), Auburn University, Clemson University, Georgia Tech, the University of Pennsylvania, Washington & Jefferson College, and Rice University, compiling a career college football record of 186-70-18. In 1917, Heisman's Georgia Tech Golden Tornado were recognized as the national champion. Heisman was also the head basketball coach at Georgia Tech, tallying a mark of 9-14, and the head baseball coach at Buchtel, Clemson, and Georgia Tech, amassing a career college baseball record of 199-108-7.\\n\\nHeisman first coached at Oberlin College. In 1892, The Oberlin Review wrote: \\"Mr. Heisman has entirely remade our football. He has taught us scientific football.\\" He used the double pass, from tackle to halfback, and moved his quarterback to the safety position on defense. Influenced by Yale and Pudge Heffelfinger, Heisman implemented the now illegal \\"flying wedge\\" formation. It involved seven players arranged as a \\"V\\" to protect the ball carrier. Heisman was also likely influenced by Heffelfinger to pull guards on end runs.  On his 1892 team, Heisman's trainer was Clarence Hemingway, the father of author Ernest Hemingway and one of his linemen was the first Hawaiian to play college football, the future politician John Henry Wise. The team beat Ohio State twice, and considered itself undefeated at the end of the season. However, the outcome of its game against Michigan is still in dispute. Michigan declared it had won the game, 26-24, but Oberlin said it won 24-22. The referee, an Oberlin supporter, had ruled that time had expired. The umpire, a Michigan supporter, ruled otherwise. Michigan then ran for a touchdown with no Oberlin players on the field. The Michigan Daily and Detroit Tribune reported that Michigan had won the game, while The Oberlin News and The Oberlin Review reported that Oberlin had won.  In 1893, Heisman became the football and baseball coach at Buchtel College. A disappointing baseball season was made up for by a 5-2 football season. It was then customary for the center to begin a play by rolling or kicking the ball backwards, but this proved difficult for Buchtel's unusually tall quarterback Harry Clark. Under Heisman, the center began tossing the ball to Clark, a practice that eventually evolved into the snap.  Buchtel won a single game against Ohio State at the Ohio State Fair before Heisman returned to Oberlin in 1894, posting a 4-3-1 record, including losses to Michigan and undefeated Penn State. The Penn State game ended with a fair catch and free kick, which resulted in a field goal for Penn State. Referees were confused whether teams could kick a field goal or had to punt on a free kick, and the game ended 6-4 in favor of Oberlin, but Walter Camp over-ruled the game officials, allowing Penn State its extra free kick and the victory 9-6.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How did he do at Buchtel?","target":"Buchtel won a single game against Ohio State at the Ohio State Fair before Heisman returned to Oberlin in 1894,","rationale":"The context is a description of John Heisman's stint as the coach at Buchtel.

It goes on to mention some specific details about his tenure there before stating: \\nBuchtel won a single game against Ohio State at the Ohio State Fair before Heisman returned to Oberlin in 1894,\\nThis line clearly states how long it took him until he left Buchtel college after getting one win against Ohio state."},{"source":"(CNN) -- The growth of e-commerce in China has outpaced that of western countries during the past five years.

Because they were observing radio silence, Nishimura was unable to synchronize with Shima and Kurita. Nishimura and Shima had failed to even coordinate their plans before the attacks – they were long-time rivals and neither wished to have anything to do with the other. When he entered the narrow Surigao Strait at about 02:00, Shima was 22 miles (40 km) behind him, and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea, several hours from the beaches at Leyte. As they passed Panaon Island, Nishimura's force ran into a trap set for them by the U.S.-Australian 7th Fleet Support Force. R. Adm. Jesse Oldendorf had six battleships, four heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, 29 destroyers and 39 PT boats. To pass the strait and reach the landings, Nishimura had to run the gauntlet. At about 03:00 the Japanese battleship Fusō and three destroyers were hit by torpedoes and Fusō broke in two. At 03:50 the U.S. battleships opened fire. Radar fire control meant they could hit targets from a much greater distance than the Japanese. The battleship Yamashiro, a cruiser and a destroyer were crippled by 16-inch (406 mm) shells; Yamashiro sank at 04:19. Only one of Nishimura's force of seven ships survived the engagement. At 04:25 Shima's force of two cruisers and eight destroyers reached the battle.

For reasons of cost and simplicity, most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature. Occasionally, a linear alternator or a rotating armature with a stationary magnetic field is used. In principle, any AC electrical generator can be called an alternator, but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines. An alternator that uses a permanent magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto. Alternators in power stations driven by steam turbines are called turbo-alternators. Large 50 or 60 Hz three phase alternators in power plants generate most of the world's electric power, which is distributed by electric power grids.\\n\\n- The Cheshire Plain is a relatively flat expanse of lowland almost entirely within the county of Cheshire in north-west England. It extends from the Mersey Valley in the north to the Shropshire Hills in the south, bounded by the hills of north Wales to the west and the foothills of the Pennines to the north-east. The Wirral Peninsula lies to the north-west whilst the plain merges with the South Lancashire Plain in the embayment occupied by Manchester to the north. In detail, the plain comprises two areas with distinct characters, the one to the west of the Mid Cheshire Ridge and the other, larger, part to its east.\\n\\n- The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England.\\n\\n- A dynamo is an electrical generator that produces direct current with the use of a commutator. Dynamos were the first electrical generators capable of delivering power for industry, and the foundation upon which many other later electric-power conversion devices were based, including the electric motor, the alternating-current alternator, and the rotary converter. Today, the simpler alternator dominates large scale power generation, for efficiency, reliability and cost reasons. A dynamo has the disadvantages of a mechanical commutator. Also, converting alternating to direct current using power rectification devices (vacuum tube or more recently solid state) is effective and usually economical.\\n\\n- Henry Wilde ( 1833 -- 28 March 1919 ) was a wealthy individual from Manchester , England who used his self - made fortune to indulge his interest in electrical engineering . He invented the dynamo - electric machine , or self - energising dynamo , an invention for which Werner von Siemens is more usually credited and , in fact , discovered independently . At any rate , Wilde was the first to publish , his paper was communicated to the Royal Society by Michael Faraday in 1866 . The self - energising dynamo replaces the permanent magnets of previous designs with electro - magnets and in so doing achieved an enormous increase in power . The machine was considered remarkable at the time , especially since Wilde was fond of spectacular demonstrations , such as the ability of his machine to cause iron bars to melt .\\n\\n- A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.\\n\\n- Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys. The prefix \\"\\" refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, FeO.\\n\\n- Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 2.8 million. It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Manchester and Salford. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972; and designated a City Region on 1 April 2011.\\n\\n- Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 . It lies within the United Kingdom's second-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.55 million. Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council.\\n\\n- Diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic field; an applied magnetic field creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of magnetic dipoles in the material. The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than , the permeability of vacuum. In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a superconductor acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- Michael Faraday FRS (22 September 1791  25 August 1867) was an English scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis.\\n\\n- Manchester City Council is the local government authority for Manchester, a city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England. It is composed of 96 councillors, three for each of the 32 electoral wards of Manchester. The council is controlled by the Labour Party and led by Sir Richard Leese. Sir Howard Bernstein is the chief executive. Many of the council's staff are based at Manchester Town Hall.\\n\\n- Cheshire (or ; archaically the County Palatine of Chester; abbreviated Ches.) is a county in North West England, bordering Merseyside and Greater Manchester to the north, Derbyshire to the east, Staffordshire and Shropshire to the south and Wales to the west (bordering Wrexham and Flintshire).

To establish the value of ovariohysterectomy in female beagle dogs as a model for bone loss and to study static and dynamic parameters of bone associated with the negative bone balance occurring after cessation of ovarian function, we performed iliac crest bone biopsies before and 4 months after ovariohysterectomy in eight beagle dogs and in five sham-operated controls. Cessation of ovarian function was documented by an increase in serum levels of LH 4 weeks after ovariohysterectomy. There was no change in serum calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine during the 4 months of the study. Cancellous bone mass and trabecular mean wall thickness decreased significantly after ovariohysterectomy (P less than 0.01). In addition, the number of osteoblasts was increased and the bone formation rate per osteoblast, that is, the activity of bone-forming cells, was decreased (P less than 0.01). Parameters of bone resorption were not significantly altered in the animals with ovariohysterectomy. No changes in histomorphometric parameters of bone structure, formation or resorption were observed in the sham-operated controls. These data indicate that ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs may serve as a useful model for bone loss associated with cessation of ovarian function. Osteoblastic insufficiency appears to play a major role in the maintenance of bone loss occurring after ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs.","target":"Amenorrhea","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nThe abstract describes a study of the effects of ovariohysterectomy on bone loss in female beagle dogs.

In the first part of the test, Group1 were rewarded with a piece of meat for copying their owner's actions. Group2 were rewarded with food for not copying and using other ways. With each dog the experiment was repeated hundreds of times. Scientists recorded the time to see which group was first to get 85% right.

Previously, the Hunchback (HB) protein has been implicated in setting the anterior expression limit of the UBX homeotic protein in parasegment 6. Here we investigate DNA elements and trans-acting repressors that control spatial expression of the Abdominal-A (ABD-A) homeotic protein. Analysis of a 1.7-kb enhancer element [iab-2(1.7)] from the iab-2 regulatory region shows that in contrast to Ubx enhancer elements, both HB and Krüppel (KR) are required to set the ABD-A anterior boundary in parasegment 7. DNase I footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis show that HB and KR are direct regulators of this iab-2 enhancer. The single KR site can be moved to a new location 100 bp away and still maintain repressive activity, whereas relocation by 300 bp abolishes activity. These results suggest that KR repression occurs through a local quenching mechanism. We also show that the gap repressor Giant (GT) initially establishes a posterior expression limit at PS9, which shifts posteriorly after the blastoderm stage. Finally, we show that this iab-2 enhancer contains multiple binding sites for the Polycomb group protein Pleiohomeotic (PHO). These iab-2 PHO sites are required in vivo for chromosome pairing-dependent repression of a mini-white reporter. However, the PHO sites are not sufficient to maintain repression of a homeotic reporter gene anterior to PS7. Full maintenance at late embryonic stages requires additional sequences adjacent to the iab-2(1.7) enhancer.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not include a topic sentence or closing sentence, and it provides a continuous description of the experiment without any breaks.

His roots extend for generations in Virginia and North Carolina, and one of his ancestors journeyed to West Africa in 1831, prompting other relatives to emigrate from America to Liberia in 1832. He met Chad Hugo in a seventh-grade summer band camp where Williams played the keyboards and drums and Hugo played tenor saxophone. They were also both members of a marching band; Williams played the snare drum while Hugo was drum major.\\nContext: On March 31, 2014, Williams was announced as a new coach for the seventh season of The Voice, replacing CeeLo Green. On May 18, 2015, Team Pharrell had 16-year-old Sawyer Fredericks win the eighth season of The Voice. In June 2014, it was announced that Williams would make a guest appearance on the docu-series Sisterhood of Hip Hop. Williams was the executive producer of Atlanta rapper T.I.'s ninth studio album, Paperwork, which was released on October 21, 2014 by Grand Hustle and Columbia Records. In May 2014, Williams curated an art show named after his album, \\"Girl,\\" at the Galerie Perrotin in Paris, France. The show included 37 artists including Takashi Murakami, JR, Daniel Arsham, and Marina Abramovic among others.\\" Comme des Garcons developed a unisex fragrance with Williams scheduled for release in late 2014. Kaws designed the bottle artwork.  In January 2015, Williams and Al Gore announced that they are teaming up to create a 7-continent \\"Live Earth\\" concert on June 18 to raise awareness about and pressure governments to act on climate change. He is the musical director. On February 8, 2015, Williams made a cameo in an episode of The Simpsons entitled \\"Walking Big & Tall\\" where he comes to Springfield to write a new anthem for the town. Williams recorded three songs for the soundtrack to the animated film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. He also recorded a song \\"Shine\\" with Gwen Stefani for the Paddington movie. At the 2015 Grammy Awards Williams performed an orchestral rendition of \\"Happy\\" with composer Hans Zimmer and pianist Lang Lang that included a tribute to the Black Lives Matter \\"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\\" movement inspired by Eric Garner's death and the events in Ferguson, Missouri. In 2015, a unanimous jury determined that Williams's 2013 hit song \\"Blurred Lines\\" was an infringement of the 1977 Marvin Gaye song \\"Got to Give It Up\\". The jury awarded the Gaye family $7.4 million in damages for the copyright infringement based on profits generated.  In October 2015, the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University named Williams as their artist-in-residence. He gave the 2017 commencement address at NYU and received an honorary degree on May 17, 2017.  Also in October 2015, Williams announced that he will perform with a gospel choir on Sunday, November 1, at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine black parishioners were shot and killed on June 17, allegedly by a young white man who is awaiting trial. This is part of a program on race relations being produced by A+E Networks and iHeartMedia. Williams plans to speak with community leaders and others affected by the shooting, which dominated the U.S. news media for several days. The two-hour Shining a Light: A Concert for Progress on Race in America program is scheduled to air November 20, and will also feature a concert to be filmed November 18 in Los Angeles.

There are similarities, of course, but the cops (policemen) don't think much of them.\\n       The first difference is that a policeman's real life revolves round (......) the law. Most of his training is in criminal law. He has to know exactly what actions are crimes and what evidence can be used to prove them in court. He has to know nearly as much law as a professional lawyer, and what is more, he has to apply it on his feet, in the dark and rain, running down an alley   after someone he wants to talk to.\\n       Little of his time is spent in chatting to charming ladies or in dramatic confrontations   with desperate criminals.

As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria--then part of Austria-Hungary--and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I.\\n\\nIn 1923 Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the \\"Beer Hall Putsch\\". The NSDAP used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini's \\"March on Rome\\" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (state commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria's de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.  On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the Burgerbraukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.  Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide. He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason. His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.  While at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Some passages imply genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.  Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to Austria. The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How many volumes of Mein Kampf are there?","target":"Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926,","rationale":"The answer is \\"Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926,\\" as it answers the question."},{"source":"FINAL EXAM\\n\\nQuestion 1.

So, when a friend suggested an idea, I thought it would be a great program for my students. The plan was simple.

After doing their chores, the youngsters would earn the freedom to walk one of the dogs in the wooded area behind the shelter, where I couldn't even see them.\\nWe began the project. Each week, I carefully went over the list of students who had met the requirements. All that week, students worked hard to control their tempers and be cooperative.

Never before had they been considered contributing members of society.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage:\\nThe severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots.\\nThe very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin.\\nIn order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment.\\nAfter cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.\\n\\nAfter gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them.\\nWhat effect does Australian sun have on the skin?\\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\\n- a few cases of skin damage\\n- skin is well toned\\n- not enough information\\n- many cases of skin damage","target":"many cases of skin damage","rationale":"The context of this question discusses the effects that being exposed to sunlight in Australia can have on one's skin. The author mentions \\"a multitude\\" of cases, which means many or a lot. This suggests that exposure to Australian sun has an adverse effect, resulting in damage to the skin for multiple people.\\nSo, the answer is many cases of skin damage."},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

It is often used as an efficient way to solve Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori estimation problems, especially for models with latent variables. It is also the algorithm of choice to fit mixture models: generative models that represent unlabelled points originating from $k$ different processes, as samples from $k$ multivariate distributions. In this work we define and use a quantum version of EM to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model. Given quantum access to a dataset of $n$ vectors of dimension $d$, our algorithm has convergence and precision guarantees similar to the classical algorithm, but the runtime is only polylogarithmic in the number of elements in the training set, and is polynomial in other parameters - as the dimension of the feature space, and the number of components in the mixture. We generalize further the algorithm by fitting any mixture model of base distributions in the exponential family. We discuss the performance of the algorithm on datasets that are expected to be classified successfully by those algorithms, arguing that on those cases we can give strong guarantees on the runtime.","target":"It's the quantum algorithm for Expectation Maximization.

His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians.

Controls received either 0.01 M PBS (1 ml, im; n = 2) or 0.01 M gel-PBS (gel; 1 ml, os; n = 2) in cervical os. One relaxin-treated (im) heifer calved at 4 h and 36 min after treatment; thus, data from this heifer were not included in subsequent analysis. Relaxin-treated heifers showed an acute elevation in relaxin, a precipitous decrease in progesterone, and a significant (P less than 0.05) elevation of E1 and 17 beta-E2. Plasma relaxin levels were 4.95, 1.5, and 0.24 ng/ml at 0.5 h in RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and control animals, respectively. Peripheral plasma relaxin peaked between 23-31 ng/ml 1-2.5 h before returning to less than 0.5 ng/ml 5-12 h after treatment. Relaxin administration accounted for 70%, 73%, and 58% of the progesterone, E1, and 17 beta-E2 variability between treatments, respectively. An abrupt decrease (P less than 0.01) in progesterone preceded the rises (P less than 0.05) in E1 and 17 beta-E2 at 1.5, 2-2.5, and 2-3.5 h, respectively. Maximum progesterone deviations from the pretreatment mean concentration were -5.43, -3.05, and -0.92 ng/ml for RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and controls. Progesterone rebounded from 36% to 61% and 62% to 79% of respective pretreatment means for RLX-IM and RLX-OS. Peak elevation of E1 was 407.3, 306.5, and 71.5 pg/ml and that of 17 beta-E2 was 82.2, 35.8, and 7.8 ng/ml for RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and controls, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that a pharmacological dosage of relaxin induces an acute depression of progesterone secretion beginning within 90 min in beef heifers during late pregnancy. We suggest that these early and marked luteolytic effects of relaxin on progesterone secretion in cattle could be by direct or indirect actions via mechanisms that are yet unknown.","target":"Acute decrease in progesterone and increase in estrogen secretion caused by relaxin during late pregnancy in beef heifers","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that investigated the effects of im and os relaxin administration on progesterone, estrone (E1), and 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) secretion in beef heifers during late pregnancy.

This distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes. Sporangia in Seedless Plants The sporophyte of seedless plants is diploid and results from syngamy (fusion) of two gametes. The sporophyte bears the sporangia (singular, sporangium): organs that first appeared in the land plants. The term “sporangia” literally means “spore in a vessel,” as it is a reproductive sac that contains spores Figure 25.3. Inside the multicellular sporangia, the diploid sporocytes, or mother cells, produce haploid spores by meiosis, where the 2n chromosome number is reduced to 1n (note that many plant sporophytes are polyploid: for example, durum wheat is tetraploid, bread wheat is hexaploid, and some ferns are 1000-ploid). The spores are later released by the sporangia and disperse in the environment. Two different types of spores are produced in land plants, resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the lifecycle. Seedless nonvascular plants produce only one kind of spore and are called homosporous. The gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants. After germinating from a spore, the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia, usually on the same individual. In contrast, heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores. The male spores are called microspores, because of their smaller size, and develop into the male gametophyte; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte. Heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- Carboid\\n\\n- germination\\n\\n- cyanobacteria\\n\\n- sporangia\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"sporangia","rationale":"The correct answer is \\"sporangia\\", as it's the term literally means “spore in a vessel”, which was mentioned in the paragraph."},{"source":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: \\n\\nRutherford’s discoveries meant that Thomson’s plum pudding model was incorrect.

Now based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire and operating from the satellite airfield at Wellingore the unit formed part of No. 12 Group RAF defending British air space north of London. On the night of 24 August 1940 Braham took off and patrolled the Humberside area. The Blenheim was piloted by Braham, and contained air gunner Sergeant Wilsdon and aircraftman and trained radar operator N. Jacobson. Braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot. His gunner succeeded in damaging the aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it crash into the sea. It was identified as a Heinkel He 111. Braham's only other interaction with the enemy occurred at Ternhill, when a Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs on the airfield destroying 13 Avro Ansons and damaged 20 more.

There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans. Further offshoots include the first-language English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans, Zambians, Swazilanders and Namibians.\\n\\n- Canadian English (CanE, CE, en-CA) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada. According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.\\n\\n- British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"\\n\\n- International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and between nations. It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts.\\n\\n- Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\\nRights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\".\\n\\n- The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. John Locke defined freedom under the rule of law as follows:\\n\\n- Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"\\n\\n- Human rights are moral principles or norms, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \\"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,\\" and which are \\"inherent in all human beings\\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.\\n\\n- A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.","target":"kalmen kaplansky , human rights activist","rationale":"The question asks to choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.

Passage 1:Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the area was occupied by farms and orchards which belonged to the residents of Baku. After the construction of the Baku Train Station in 1883, there arose a need in a paved road that would connect the station with the city. In 1887, the first telephone exchange in Baku was built here. It gave the street its first name, Telefonnaya (Telephone Street). By the end of the nineteenth century, horsecars already ran on the street. The street itself, however, continued to be regarded as a city periphery, home to the urban poor and beggars, well into the end of the nineteenth century. In 1898, it gained importance due to the construction of the first Lutheran church in Baku. In the early twentieth century, oil magnate Musa Naghiyev had the city's first multi-family residentials built on this street. In 1913, Telefonnaya was renamed to Romanovsky Prospekt (Romanov Avenue) to mark the 300th anniversary of the Romanov rule in the Russian Empire. In 1918, after Azerbaijan became independent from Russia, it was renamed to Lindley Street after Sir William Lindley who had contributed to the infrastructural development of Czar-era Baku. In 1923, after the Bolshevik power was installed in Azerbaijan, the Soviet government decided to get rid of the \\"bourgeois toponymy\\" and the street was given the name 28 April (the date of Azerbaijan's sovietisation in 1920). It was gradually built up as one or two-storey courtyard-based buildings gave way to blocks of flats, or were transformed into taller buildings through superstructures. In 1934, two massive identical Stalinist-style buildings were completed at the very beginning of the street, designed by Mikayil Huseynov and Sadikh Dadashov. One of them housed the Nizami Cinema, while the other later became the head office of AzerTaj. In the 1950s, the so-called Soldier Market was removed from the former Yarmarochnaya Square to be replaced by the Samad Vurghun Park, featuring the poet's giant statue at the entrance. In 1967, the underground of the street was traversed by the first metro line, with 28 April station built nearby. In 1991, both the street and the station were renamed to 28 May to mark the anniversary of Azerbaijan's declaration of independence in 1918. Today 28 May Street is one of the largest in the city. The traffic between Bulbul Avenue and Sorge Street is one-way from east to west. The tramway which connected the easternmost part of the street with the Black City was dismantled in the early 2000s.\\n Passage 2:The opening phase of what came to be called the Burnside Expedition, the Battle of Roanoke Island was an amphibious operation of the American Civil War, fought on February 7–8, 1862, in the North Carolina Sounds a short distance south of the Virginia border. The attacking force consisted of a flotilla of gunboats of the Union Navy drawn from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, commanded by Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough, a separate group of gunboats under Union Army control, and an army division led by Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. The defenders were a group of gunboats from the Confederate States Navy, termed the Mosquito Fleet, under Capt. William F. Lynch, and about 2,000 Confederate soldiers commanded locally by Brig. Gen. Henry A. Wise. The defense was augmented by four forts facing on the water approaches to Roanoke Island, and two outlying batteries. At the time of the battle, Wise was hospitalized, so leadership fell to his second in command, Col. Henry M. Shaw.\\n Passage 3:Dorothy Eugenia Miner was born in New York City, New York, on 4 November 1904. She attended the Horace Mann School before she enrolled in Barnard College in 1922, receiving her bachelor's degree four years later. Miner became the first Barnard International Fellow and studied at the Bedford College of the University of London. She studied medieval manuscript illumination with Meyer Schapiro at Columbia University in 1928–29 and received a fellowship to continue working on her dissertation on a Carolingian Apocalypse manuscript the following year. Miner was hired by the Pierpont Morgan Library to prepare an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts in 1933–34 and the director of the library, Belle da Costa Greene, recommended her for the position of keeper of manuscripts at the Walters Art Gallery, in Baltimore, Maryland. She got the job and became of the first professionally trained art historians working in an American museum. She was also curator of Islamic and Near Eastern Art as well as the head of the reference library for several years. From 1938 to 1969 Miner edited the Journal of the Walter Gallery and many catalogues published by the museum.

When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father re-entered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments. Durant has one sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.\\n\\nOn July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Warriors in The Players' Tribune. The move was received negatively by the public and NBA analysts, with many comparing it to LeBron James's 2010 off-season departure from the Cleveland Cavaliers to join the Heat. On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year. Reflecting on the move for Sports Illustrated, Ben Golliver wrote, \\"He chose an ideal roster fit and a shot at playing for the highest-scoring offense the NBA has seen in decades. He chose life alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, and he chose to go against Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green, two elite defenders, in practices rather than in Western Conference finals games.\\"  Durant made his debut for the Warriors on October 25 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring a team-high 27 points in a 129-100 loss. On November 26, he recorded 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and a career-high six blocked shots in a 115-102 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the first player in team history to finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and five blocks in a single game. On February 11, in his first game back in Oklahoma City since leaving for Golden State, Durant scored 34 points while being booed throughout the night as he helped the Warriors defeat the Thunder for the third time that year. In March, Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise, which forced him to miss the final 19 games of the season. Golden State finished the year with a 67-15 record and entered the playoffs as the No. 1 seed.  Durant returned from injury in time for the playoffs and helped the Warriors advance to their third consecutive Finals while becoming the first team in league history to start the postseason 12-0. In Game 1 of the series, Durant had 38 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists to lead the Warriors past LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers, 113-91. He helped the Warriors go up 3-0 in the series with a 31-point effort in Game 3, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds left in regulation. In Game 5, he scored 39 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in a series-clinching 129-120 win. For the Finals, Durant was the Golden State's top scorer in every game, averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists while shooting 55.5 percent from the field, 47.4 percent from three-point range, and 92.7 percent from the free throw line. He was subsequently named the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player.

In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts.

The latter score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Eric Decker.

The Broncos then reeled off 21 unanswered points, with Manning adding two more touchdown passes &#8212; a 2-yarder to Decker and a 9-yarder to Thomas, followed by Manning rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on a bootleg play. A 48-yard field goal by Bailey at the end of the first half narrowed the Broncos' lead to 28-20. In the second half, the Broncos added to their lead midway through the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. However, the Cowboys subsequently began chipping away at the Broncos' lead, with Romo connecting on an 82-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrance Williams. A 48-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos a 38-27 lead, but the Cowboys further narrowed the Broncos' lead, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). Following an intercepted Broncos' pass,  the Cowboys subsequently re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, coupled with a two-point pass from Romo to Williams. The Broncos tied the game at 41-41 on their next possession, with a 50-yard field goal by Prater.  As the shootout continued, on the Cowboys' next possession, Romo connected on a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cole Beasley to give the Cowboys a 48-41 lead with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter. Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter.

On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter. After three kneel-downs by Manning, Prater nailed the game-winning 28-yard field goal as time expired.

For reasons of cost and simplicity, most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature. Occasionally, a linear alternator or a rotating armature with a stationary magnetic field is used. In principle, any AC electrical generator can be called an alternator, but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines. An alternator that uses a permanent magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto. Alternators in power stations driven by steam turbines are called turbo-alternators. Large 50 or 60 Hz three phase alternators in power plants generate most of the world's electric power, which is distributed by electric power grids.\\n\\n- The Cheshire Plain is a relatively flat expanse of lowland almost entirely within the county of Cheshire in north-west England. It extends from the Mersey Valley in the north to the Shropshire Hills in the south, bounded by the hills of north Wales to the west and the foothills of the Pennines to the north-east. The Wirral Peninsula lies to the north-west whilst the plain merges with the South Lancashire Plain in the embayment occupied by Manchester to the north. In detail, the plain comprises two areas with distinct characters, the one to the west of the Mid Cheshire Ridge and the other, larger, part to its east.\\n\\n- The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England.\\n\\n- A dynamo is an electrical generator that produces direct current with the use of a commutator. Dynamos were the first electrical generators capable of delivering power for industry, and the foundation upon which many other later electric-power conversion devices were based, including the electric motor, the alternating-current alternator, and the rotary converter. Today, the simpler alternator dominates large scale power generation, for efficiency, reliability and cost reasons. A dynamo has the disadvantages of a mechanical commutator. Also, converting alternating to direct current using power rectification devices (vacuum tube or more recently solid state) is effective and usually economical.\\n\\n- Henry Wilde ( 1833 -- 28 March 1919 ) was a wealthy individual from Manchester , England who used his self - made fortune to indulge his interest in electrical engineering . He invented the dynamo - electric machine , or self - energising dynamo , an invention for which Werner von Siemens is more usually credited and , in fact , discovered independently . At any rate , Wilde was the first to publish , his paper was communicated to the Royal Society by Michael Faraday in 1866 . The self - energising dynamo replaces the permanent magnets of previous designs with electro - magnets and in so doing achieved an enormous increase in power . The machine was considered remarkable at the time , especially since Wilde was fond of spectacular demonstrations , such as the ability of his machine to cause iron bars to melt .\\n\\n- A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.\\n\\n- Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys. The prefix \\"\\" refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, FeO.\\n\\n- Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 2.8 million. It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Manchester and Salford. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972; and designated a City Region on 1 April 2011.\\n\\n- Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 . It lies within the United Kingdom's second-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.55 million. Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council.\\n\\n- Diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic field; an applied magnetic field creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of magnetic dipoles in the material. The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than , the permeability of vacuum. In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a superconductor acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- Michael Faraday FRS (22 September 1791  25 August 1867) was an English scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis.\\n\\n- Manchester City Council is the local government authority for Manchester, a city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England. It is composed of 96 councillors, three for each of the 32 electoral wards of Manchester. The council is controlled by the Labour Party and led by Sir Richard Leese.

Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.\\n\\n- Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos).

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home.

On his 13th at-bat, however, he hit a towering home run over the left field roof of the Polo Grounds off of future Hall of Famer Warren Spahn. Spahn later joked, \\"I'll never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out.\\" Mays's batting average improved steadily throughout the rest of the season. Although his .274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 Rookie of the Year Award. During the Giants' comeback in August and September 1951 to tie the Dodgers in the pennant race, Mays' fielding and strong throwing arm were instrumental to several important Giants victories. Mays was in the on-deck circle when Bobby Thomson hit the Shot Heard 'Round the World against Ralph Branca and the Brooklyn Dodgers to win the three-game playoff 2-1 after the teams were tied at the end of the regular season.  The Giants went on to meet the New York Yankees in the 1951 World Series. In Game 1, Mays, Hank Thompson and Hall of Famer Monte Irvin comprised the first all-African-American outfield in major league history four years after the color line was broken. Mays hit poorly while the Giants lost the series 4-2. The six-game set was the only time that Mays and retiring Yankee ace Joe DiMaggio would compete against each other.  Mays was a popular figure in Harlem. Magazine photographers were fond of chronicling his participation in local stickball games with kids.

The similarity in nail morphology between the type 1 pityriasis rubra pilaris patients and five patients with chronic erythroderma resulting from Sezary syndrome indicated that these changes may represent a nonspecific reaction pattern that may result from prolonged erythema of the proximal nail bed and matrix.

Passage:In the first issue of Billboard of the year, Craig Wayne Boyd entered the Hot Country Songs chart at number one with \\"My Baby's Got a Smile on Her Face\\". Boyd, winner of season 7 of NBC's reality TV singing competition The Voice, was only the second artist in the chart's 57-year history to enter at number one. After holding the top spot for a single week, however, the song achieved the unusual feat of dropping off the chart entirely the following week.

They concentrated on a new arrangement of \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", a song recorded during the Highway 61 Revisited sessions but not included on that album. Three further numbers were attempted, but none progressed into completed songs. Both the fragmentary \\"Jet Pilot\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\", a quasi-parody of the Beatles' \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\", finally appeared on the 1985 box set retrospective, Biograph. Also attempted were two takes of \\"Medicine Sunday\\", a song that later evolved into \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\".On November 30, the Hawks joined Dylan again at Studio A, but drummer Bobby Gregg replaced Levon Helm, who had tired of playing in a backing band and quit. They began work on a new composition, \\"Freeze Out\\", which was later retitled \\"Visions of Johanna\\", but Dylan wasn't satisfied with the results. One of the November 30 recordings was eventually released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack in 2005. At this session, they completed \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\" The song was released as a single in December, but only reached number 58 on the American charts.Dylan spent most of December in California, performing a dozen concerts with his band, and then took a break through the third week in January following the birth of his son Jesse. On January 21, 1966, he returned to Columbia's Studio A to record another long composition, \\"She's Your Lover Now\\", accompanied by the Hawks (this time with Sandy Konikoff on drums).

Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Two rivers spring from the same mountain.

The Olt river springs up from a mountain and is fast moving, which suggests that it does not have much of a canopy or vegetation as trees cannot grow on mountains. This means its primary source for nutrients would be algae in the water. The Mures river has slow moving deep water which implies there may be more plants around this area providing shade allowing trees to grow near the banks. Therefore, most likely the Mures's main nutrient source will be derived from those trees along with anadromous fish species found in deeper waters like salmon and trout\\nSo, based on these observations we can deduce that Olt was entirely dependent upon algae whereas Mures had multiple sources including tree leaves etc"},{"source":"There is an old tiger in the forest  .

A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above.

Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H.

Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family. Child Labour first started to occur in England when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths. Although there are many counts of children under the age of ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen. This age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families; while also transitioning to save for their own future families.\\n\\nHow were the work oppurtunies for parents during this time period?","target":"poor","rationale":"Given the context, it is clear that children were working because they needed to help their family survive financially.

Thus, some circuits have held that “for the actual innocence exception to apply in the noncapital sentencing context, a movant must show that he is factually innocent of the conduct or underlying crime that serves as the predicate for the enhanced sentence.” McKay v.

The author is disgusted by the thought of this, and they believe that it was wrong for the boyfriend to have eaten the joint. However, while it may be unsafe to eat drugs, there is nothing wrong with doing so as long as one is aware of the risks involved and makes an informed choice about whether or not to consume drugs in that way. In this case, given that their lives were at risk when they were caught smoking weed illegally out of country and questioned by police officers, it was reasonable for your boyfriend's friend to suggest that he eat the joint. While eating a joint is not considered socially acceptable in most places and many people do not find it pleasant or attractive behavior, there are no ethical concerns about doing so because no one else's welfare was affected here (it only affected your boyfriend).

Furthermore, newborn infants of nonallergic parents had a more than threefold (p less than 0.01) higher incidence of elevated cord IgE (greater than or equal to 1.20 IU/ml) and a fourfold (p = 0.005) higher risk of developing definite or probable atopic disease before 18 months of age if the mother smoked than if she did not. Paternal smoking did not influence, in whatever the subgroup, cord IgE or subsequent infant allergy but increased cord IgD (p less than 0.001) among newborn infants with a negative family history even after controlling for maternal smoking (p less than 0.04). These results suggest that parental smoking in some way affects the fetal immune system, probably via substances in tobacco smoke. Maternal smoking in particular appears to exert a pronounced effect on the IgE system already in fetal life, predisposing even \\"low-risk\\" infants to subsequent sensitization, probably in synergy with a later acquired mucosal damage that would facilitate penetration of foreign matter. Pregnant women and mothers should be encouraged to try and give up smoking that might help to prevent allergic disease in their infants. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Maternal smoking influences cord serum IgE and IgD levels and increases the risk for subsequent infant allergy. option2: Skull x-ray examinations after head trauma.

One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the imbalance of ocean mass fluxes. After the volcano eruption, evaporation over ocean becomes lower, because it is largely determined by the ocean skin temperature change. The quick response of evaporation to the surface cooling and the delayed response of river runoff to the associated lower precipitation lead to an increased sea level. About 1~2 years later, river discharge becomes less due to the reduced precipitation and less sea ice melting, which cause sea level to drop.[9]\\n\\nand the situation: In the beginning of year 1000 mount Etna had a huge volcanic eruption. To test the effect of volcanic eruption on sea level scientists measured geological data through carbon dating. They measured the data for four different time point - for year 998, year 1000, year 1002, and year 1010.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\\n\\nThe date was July 29th, 2019.

Valet parking at the entrance was always very convenient. Was able to call from the room to have the car at the door in 10 - 15 minutes. Pricey parking at $43.00 per night, plus tax, but not much more than the other garages around the hotel. I liked walking out the door and climbing right into the car each time we needed it. Front Desk staff was courteous and efficient. Our room on the 26th floor faced West and had a beautiful view. Room was clean, nicely sized with a King bed, large desk, two comfortable chairs, and adjustable end table. Furniture a bit dated and worn, but nothing I would complain about. Bathroom was roomy and clean, albeit again a bit dated but decent. Marble counter in bath. Excellent shower head with great pressure. Love the Portico bath products! Small, funky looking TV that I enjoyed watching the news while using the bathroom. Hallways were kept clean. Generally very quiet. No issue with noise. Elevators didn't have unreasonably long waits, usually under two minutes if that. Property was generally very well kept and felt upscale. Not top notch luxury, but very nice for what it is. Ate breakfast both mornings at the Grandview restaurant on the 36th floor. Most incredible views of the city. I suggest going up there just to have a look. Food was pricey as is usually the case at a hotel restaurant, but we wanted the convenience of being able to grab a quick bite as we had a busy schedule. Wait staff was very good and friendly. Food tasty, no complaints. We paid $159.00 for our room booking directly on the Hyatt website, using the Senior Citizen rate. I believe the AAA rate is the same. For the money it was an excellent value. I recommend this hotel and most likely will consider this hotel as a first option on future trips to San Francisco.

Twenty-seven aneurysms were thrombosed and presented with an acutely ischaemic limb or the sudden onset of severe claudication. Thirty-four patent aneurysms presented with either ischaemic ulceration or claudication due to tibial artery disease or were asymptomatic with normal distal pulses. Thrombosis made reconstruction difficult and at times required a femoro-tibial graft. In others reconstruction was not possible leading to amputation either as primary treatment or following failed revascularization. In patent aneurysms one or more tibial arteries were frequently occluded. It is postulated that obliterative atheromatous disease of the tibial vessels and the slow flow through the aneurysmal vessels is responsible for the high incidence of thrombosis, poor graft patency and a high amputation rate.","target":"Aged","rationale":"The paper describes the clinical features of popliteal aneurysms. The causes of thrombosis and amputation in patients with popliteal aneurysms are discussed, including tibial artery disease, obliterative atherosclerosis, slow blood flow through the aneurysmal vessels.

In 1721 he was able to incite the Choctaw who began to raid Chickasaw villages, and to ambush pack trains along the Trader's Path leading to Charleston, South Carolina. In response, the Chickasaw regrouped their villages more tightly for defense, and cemented relations with their British source of guns by establishing a settlement at Savannah Town, South Carolina, in 1723. They blocked French traffic on the Mississippi River by occupying Chickasaw Bluff near present day Memphis, and bargained for peace with the Choctaw. Bienville himself was recalled to France in 1724 . On and off over the following years, the French successfully reignited the Indian conflict. The Choctaw pursued their familiar hit and run tactics: ambushing hunting parties, killing trader's horses, devastating croplands after using superior numbers to drive the Chickasaw into their forts, and killing peace emissaries. Illini and Iroquois occasionally pitched in from the north as well. This war of attrition effectively wore the Chickasaw down, reaching a crisis level in the late 1730s and especially the early 1740s. After a lapse due to strife within the Choctaw, the bloody harassment resumed in the 1750s. The Chickasaw remained obstinate, their situation forcing them to adhere even more closely to the British.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3).

Things were cool for several months. Time passes, I remember I did the whole “what are we?” and he kind of froze. I remember getting upset and that was a red flag there, but this was my first time with someone (I thought I was going to fast with it) so I ignored it. Carried on our relationship, we went out here and there, I guess you could say we were dating (I thought we were, and I assumed that). His birthday came, I gave a few cool gifts and what not. Then the holidays, Thanksgiving and then Christmas I did the same. At this point, he introduced me to his friends that were nice to me. So, in return, I tried to be as nice as possible and befriend them because my thinking is if you wanted to date someone you need to be cool with their friends &amp; fam. Everything was cool until\\n\\nChristmas Break//New Year’s\\n\\n\\\\*Remember this whole time I’m going to college and this was my first time ever to be on my own (away from home). During my Christmas break I decided to stay at my place so I was alone and my work is seasonal so I was literally doing nothing. \\n\\n\\\\-----&gt;  New Years. New Year seem to be a problem. Last year, I was with my parents (they’re in late 70s)  they went to bed at 7pm! So I didn’t want to go home to celebrate my new year like that. Comes the evening I get a random message from TOM’s friend asking me to go out with them for the New Year. I got excited cause I wasn’t doing anything. Excited to go, I got dressed and geared up to let loose &amp; experience the new year the right way! Then I get a message from TOM saying are you going out with my friends?! ( I should have messaged him about it before saying yes to TOM’s friend, turns out he had to work on New Years) I said yes to going because I got excited. He was really upset and said fine go. \\n\\nThe next day we talked, he thought it was wrong of me to go with his friends while he wasn’t there \\\\[ I can understand that \\\\]. I told him I wouldn’t do it again, things were weird after that, it wasn’t the same. We barely saw each other and talked, it was on and off. I get a message from the same friend that invited me out for NY to go for some food &amp; a show. I decided to go to surprise TOM since he worked later in the day. I went and it was just her, I kind of panicked and didn’t want to be rude and just leave because of what TOM and I agreed on so I went with it. TOM’s friend and I talked about life it was pretty chill, his friend was cool af. He found out, I tried to explain that I was trying to surprise TOM by just showing up unexpectedly. This backfired, things were never the same. We didn’t talk for a while until my birthday. I tried to invite him out to celebrate it but he didn’t show. 3 days later he showed up gave me a gift wished me a happy birthday and left. It was strange, like he felt like he had to do it (return a favor). Time flies and things kinda settle down. **TOM wanted to be friends rather than anything else (via tinder msg)**. I haven’t seen TOM for a while until he asked me to go out with him and his friends. I went, he was drunk and admittedly said things went too fast that’s what scared him. I wasn’t buying it because we “talked” for a whole year and he didn’t know what I was majoring in? What my hobbies were? and I’m sure a lot more. But I know all this information about TOM, it’s just salt in the wounds at this point. I TOLD HIM THAT I HATED HIM FOR NOT CARING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT NIGHT. TOM said that he would “always be nice to me”. Lol, anyway So I’m not interested in TOM anymore, I was done trying to pursue him. \\n\\nOne night this summer one of his friends \\\\*AT THE TIME\\\\* invited me out to a hot tub party, I went and after that  I got message from his friend saying that he was deleted from all social medias from TOM and was sent a message saying “why would you try to get with my ex”. I was confused. I laughed about it and his friend did too, I moved on. Over time TOM tried to talk to me on social media, I was dry and ignored it.\\n\\nThen comes this decemeber: my friend wanted me to go out to the club were I met TOM, of course he was there and so was his friends. I’m not interested in TOM but his friends greeted me we took pictures I kissed his friend on the cheek as a good bye. That night I got a message saying why did I kissed his friend. I sent “LMAO” and that was it. Then a week later I was sent a message to go out with a few friends that were gonna be with TOM. This is New Year weekend, so I had nothing like last year and I went to have a few drinks. Cops were out so I stood around till the bar closed. Tom and his friends were done with clubbing and were waiting on a ride. I offered to get an UBER to be nice and to make sure everyone arrives safely to their destinations. Uber X carries on 4 I totally spaced on that and there was 5 of us. So in the end we tried to pack in the car and the uber driver was like this can’t happen so I jump out and said  I’ll just go home ( I didn’t live to far from the club and wasn’t too drunk) I got out and the car started to drive off and then out of no where one of TOM’s friend jumped out and thought it was messed up for me to get an uber for everyone and not even take it. Tom and the people made it back to their destination. Out of no-where me and the friend that rode with me back to the same destination gets deleted from TOM’s social media. I don’t care, I ended up blocking him in return. His friend was like what did I do? I apologized for bring him in this mess even though I was just trying to be nice and be cautious about going home. Apparently, TOM was mad, stormed off as soon as they are arrived.\\n\\nAt this time his friends told me the truth (since he was gone) and everything that was wrong with me and him. I found out that TOM’s friends are not trustworthy, they tend to “mess around” with a lot people. I think I can say that TOM has insecurities because he thought I slept with his friends in the past. Tom’s friends said I was too nice and tried to please TOM no matter what. Also, Tom’s friends told him to take me seriously. Tom’s friends said I was too honest which made things worse at times. \\n\\nThere was a reason why I wanted to wait till I was older to try to date and to experience things with someone I cared about.

The author describes several instances in which they made decisions that negatively impacted their relationship with the other person, including kissing another friend on the cheek, attempting to set up a group activity without considering whether all parties would be able to attend, and not communicating effectively with their partner. Each of these actions contributed to an unhealthy dynamic in which both partners felt insecure or frustrated by each other's choices. \\n\\nThe author then states that after reflecting on these past events and considering what happened from both perspectives, they are no longer interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with this person. They also have decided not to try so hard to make things work because it caused them stress and anxiety, especially when there is little hope for improvement or reconciliation in the long term. Saying no more often is an important part of establishing healthy boundaries and respecting one's own needs as well as those of others (e.g., if someone cannot commit or wants something different than you do). In this case, saying no was necessary for maintaining good mental health while also avoiding being hurt again by someone who has already caused them pain multiple times before despite repeated attempts at reconciliation. \\n\\nThe answer here is \\"RIGHT\\" because despite some mistakes made along the way (such as acting dishonestly), overall the author tried hard for many months over several years to maintain a productive friendship/relationship but eventually realized it was causing too much stress on themselves due partly from lack of communication from their partner about what he wanted out of life or how he felt toward them even after being asked explicitly several times (this may reflect either immaturity/insecurity on his part). Therefore it was ethical for them at that point let go instead pursuing further contact even though it meant disappointing him (and possibly his friends too) since doing so would have only resulted in more distress going forward if nothing changed between them moving forward.\\""},{"source":"Given the following passage\\n\\n\\"Notre Dame teams are known as the Fighting Irish.

In 1751-52, the Ahamdiya treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mughals, when Balaji Bajirao was the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire. Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled large parts of India from their capital at Pune and Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi . Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Durrani sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent Raghunathrao. He succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought northwest of India up to Peshawar under Maratha rule. Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Durrani chose to return to India and confront the Maratha forces to regain northwestern part of the subcontinent. In 1761, Durrani set out on his campaign to win back lost territories. The early skirmishes ended in victory for the Afghans against the Maratha garrisons in northwest India. By 1759, Durrani and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, Panipat was the scene of a battle for control of northern India. The Third battle of Panipat was fought between Durrani's Afghan forces and the Maratha forces in January 1761, and resulted in a decisive Durrani victory.

The Greek speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves Romioi, (as opposed to being so named by others) and, at least those educated, considered their ethnicity (genos) to be Hellenic. There were, however, many Greeks who escaped the second-class status of Christians inherent in the Ottoman millet system, according to which Muslims were explicitly awarded senior status and preferential treatment. These Greeks either emigrated, particularly to their fellow Greek Orthodox protector, the Russian Empire, or simply converted to Islam, often only very superficially and whilst remaining crypto-Christian. The most notable examples of large-scale conversion to Turkish Islam among those today defined as Greek Muslims - excluding those who had to convert as a matter of course on being recruited through the devshirme - were to be found in Crete (Cretan Turks), Greek Macedonia (for example among the Vallahades of western Macedonia), and among Pontic Greeks in the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands.

When inflammation becomes unregulated, recurrent, or excessive, it interferes with burn wound healing. Autophagy, which is a homeostatic and catabolic degradation process, was found to protect against ischemic injury, inflammatory diseases, and apoptosis in some cases. In the present study, we investigated whether far-infrared (FIR) could ameliorate burn wound progression and promote wound healing both in vitro and in a rat model of deep second-degree burn. We found that FIR induced autophagy in differentiated THP-1 cells (human monocytic cells differentiated to macrophages). Furthermore, FIR inhibited both the NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-activated THP-1 macrophages. In addition, FIR induced the ubiquitination of ASC, which is the adaptor protein of the inflammasome, by increasing tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which is a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Furthermore, the exposure to FIR then promoted the delivery of inflammasome to autophagosomes for degradation. In a rat burn model, FIR ameliorated burn-induced epidermal thickening, inflammatory cell infiltration, and loss of distinct collagen fibers. Moreover, FIR enhanced autophagy and suppressed the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the rat skin tissue of the burn model. Based on these results, we suggest that FIR-regulated autophagy and inflammasomes will be important for the discovery of novel therapeutics to promote the healing of burn wounds.","target":"0","rationale":"The passage introduces the research question of this study (i.e., \\\\\\"whether far-infrared (FIR) could ameliorate burn wound progression and promote wound healing\\\\\\"), but does not explicitly state a main objective or aim for the research.

In 1564 the Swedes marched under Claude Collart and re-occupied Jemtland, as well as Herjedalen and Trøndelag, including the city of Trondheim. Initially facing little opposition from the locals, their subsequent ill treatment of the Trøndelag natives, along with tax pressure, laid the groundwork for later resistance to Swedish invasion. Also, Trøndelag was assisted by the governor of Bergenhus, Erik Rosenkrantz, who forced 3500 local peasants to assist him and his 50 professional soldiers.

In the south-east Sweden captured Båhus Fortress, but lost it in 1566. Another part of the army marched through the valley Østerdalen in 1567, captured Hamar and continued towards Oslo. They reached as far as the Skiensfjord, and torched Skien at one point. In Oslo, however, citizens torched the city before invaders could seize it. From the south-east, more Swedish forces were then sent to aid in capturing Akershus Fortress near Oslo. These forces torched Konghelle and Sarpsborg on their way. They were repelled from Oslo by local forces together with men belonging to Erik Rosenkrantz and the King of Denmark and Norway.

CT scan without contrast (head, sinus, orbits, abdomen, pelvis, cervical, thoracic, lumbar and dental scans) take approximately 15 minutes. CT studies with contrast of the chest, pelvis, head or neck take approximately 30 minutes. The scans are reported by a radiologist after the technician finishes the scan. The time taken to read and report the scan depends upon many factors like contrast used and comparison with a previously done CT Scan. Usually the report is available within 24 hours.

The best studied nidoviruses, the corona-and arteriviruses, employ a unique transcription mechanism, which involves discontinuous RNA synthesis, a process resembling similarityassisted copy-choice RNA recombination. During infection, multiple subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are transcribed from a mirror set of sg negative-strand RNA templates. The sg mRNAs all possess a short 5¢ common leader sequence, derived from the 5¢ end of the genomic RNA. The joining of the non-contiguous leader' and\`body' sequences presumably occurs during minus-strand synthesis. To study whether toroviruses use a similar transcription mechanism, we characterized the 5¢ termini of the genome and the four sg mRNAs of Berne virus (BEV). We show that BEV mRNAs 3±5 lack a leader sequence. Surprisingly, however, RNA 2 does contain a leader, identical to the 5¢-terminal 18 residues of the genome. Apparently, BEV combines discontinuous and nondiscontinous RNA synthesis to produce its sg mRNAs.

Immunization is the deliberate exposure of a person to a pathogen in order to provoke an immune response and the formation of memory cells specific to that pathogen. The pathogen is often injected. However, only part of a pathogen, a weakened form of the pathogen, or a dead pathogen is typically used. This causes an immune response without making the immunized person sick. This is how you most likely became immune to measles, mumps, and chicken pox. You can watch an animation showing how immunization brings about immunity at this link: http://www.biosolutions.info/2009/05/vaccination.html .\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Will building an immunity to a pathogen increase or decrease the chances of infection by that pathogen.","target":"decrease","rationale":"The hint mentions that immunization occurs when the body is exposed to a pathogen in order to cause an immune response. An immune response will increase the ability of antibodies and white blood cells to recognize, remember, and eliminate pathogens from the body. When this happens, it increases immunity by decreasing susceptibility to infection.\\nSo based on these facts we can conclude that building an immunity to a pathogen decreases chances of future infections with that same pathogen."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- The Douglas Aircraft Company was an American aerospace manufacturer based in Southern California.

There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks. The common name \\"oak\\" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably \\"Lithocarpus\\" (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as \\"Grevillea robusta\\" (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus \\"Quercus\\" is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa.

Sweetened mousse is served as a dessert, or used as an airy cake filling. It is sometimes stabilized with gelatin. Savory mousse may be flavored with hard boiled egg, herbs, fish or liver.\\n\\n- Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction.\\n\\n- A barrel, cask, or tun is a hollow cylindrical container, traditionally made of wooden staves bound by wooden or metal hoops. Traditionally, the barrel was a standard size of measure referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity. For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of . Wine was shipped in barrels of .\\n\\n- Flavor (or flavour; see spelling differences) is the sensory impression of food or other substance, and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell. The \\"trigeminal senses\\", which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall Gestalt of flavor perception. The flavor of the food, as such, can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'has part' with the subject 'runeberg torte'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- a\\n - air\\n - asia\\n - black\\n - brown sugar\\n - butter\\n - cake\\n - chocolate\\n - coconut\\n - cream\\n - e\\n - earth\\n - egypt\\n - euphoria\\n - eurasia\\n - europe\\n - evergreen\\n - fennel\\n - french\\n - gelatin\\n - human\\n - icing\\n - india\\n - lead\\n - light\\n - liquid\\n - maize\\n - melanesia\\n - member\\n - metal\\n - mexico\\n - molasses\\n - north america\\n - palm\\n - perception\\n - powdered sugar\\n - product\\n - prunus dulcis\\n - raspberry\\n - rice\\n - rose\\n - rum\\n - s\\n - shrub\\n - smell\\n - spanish\\n - star\\n - stone\\n - sugarcane\\n - temperature\\n - vanilla\\n - whipped cream\\n - wine\\n - word","target":"prunus dulcis","rationale":"The relation \\"has part\\" is a hierarchical relationship between an object and its parts.

The battle was stopped before either side had achieved victory, and the two parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute. After the battle Amr ibn al-As was appointed by Muawiyah as an arbitrator, and Ali appointed Abu Musa Ashaari. Seven months later, in February 658, the two arbitrators met at Adhruh, about 10 miles north west of Maan in Jordon. Amr ibn al-As convinced Abu Musa Ashaari that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new Caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision which had lowered the Caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah I. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and Amr. Ali refused to accept the verdict and found himself technically in breach of his pledge to abide by the arbitration. This put Ali in a weak position even amongst his own supporters. The most vociferous opponents in Ali's camp were the very same people who had forced Ali into the ceasefire. They broke away from Ali's force, rallying under the slogan, \\"arbitration belongs to God alone.\\" This group came to be known as the Kharijites (\\"those who leave\\"). In 659 Ali's forces and the Kharijites met in the Battle of Nahrawan.

The second condition is that it should contain at least one lowercase letter and one uppercase letter, as well as at least one digit; however, there are no digits in this password (only letters and special symbols). Therefore we will first insert a digit by adding a step from changing character '9' -> '0', which makes 2 steps total so far (steps 12 through 13 below). In order to change an uppercase letter into lowercase letter or vice versa, another step needs to be added for each character changed.

She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Two botanists studied different types of plants.

In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its \\"watcher\\", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.In 1910, the owner of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also purchased the Old Lifeboat House at the end of the spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.The Point was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954, along with the adjacent Cley Marshes reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986.

Airway responsiveness to antigen and histamine was characterized by the doses that increased the airflow resistance of the total respiratory system to twice the control values (ED200). Highly significant correlations were found between airway responsiveness and cutaneous responsiveness to antigen and other immunologic characteristics (e.g., IgE and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen) in all dogs. In ragweed-sensitized dogs, there was an inverse correlation between immunologic responsiveness (reflected by the cutaneous response to antigen and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen) and nonimmunologic responsiveness of airways (histamine ED200: r = 0.73, P less than 0.05 and r = 0.75, P less than 0.01, respectively). Antigen ED200 was also correlated with histamine release from lung after antigen inhalation (r = 0.74; P less than 0.01). We conclude that airway reactions to inhaled antigen in allergic dogs are dependent not only on immunologic factors but also on the degree of nonimmunologic airway responsiveness to histamine and that these factors are correlated inversely.","target":"Immunologic and nonimmunologic responsiveness in ragweed-sensitized dogs","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that examined the relationship between airway responsiveness to inhaled antigen and histamine, immunologic release of lung histamine, immunologic responsiveness of skin, and specific IgE antibodies in ragweed-sensitized dogs.

Alighting from the cab they tip the driver generously, bribing him to not say anything to anyone about them. Alice and Judson check the departure sign for The Silver Queen, heading for Panama City, Panama, and seem excited and anxious.Also waiting for the same flight is Peggy Nolan, to whom a delivery of expensive flowers is made with a card thanking her for some favor. Peggy disdainfully tosses the card in the trash and gives the flowers to a woman selling cheap gardenias.Soon after, the flight gets ready to leave and we are introduced to Professor and Mrs. Spengler, an elderly couple, and Joe, the flight's co-pilot, who is immediately attracted to Alice. Mrs. Spengler is a domineering woman, but her husband seems content to be bossed around like a child.As they wait on the tarmac near the 'plane a car drives up and a well dressed man emerges with a young boy and another man. The boy is Tommy and he is being sent away with \\"Uncle\\" Pete until his father -- a mobster -- can follow later.As the passengers board, Bill, the pilot, receives word that they will be transporting an anarchist back to Panama, but he assures the group there is nothing to worry about since the man will be in custody during the flight. The prisoner is Vasquez, and is being accompanied by a bounty hunter named Crimp.After Larry the steward helps everyone get settled, the flight departs with its twelve souls aboard. Bill and Joe discuss plans for the layover and Joe indicates he has an interest in Alice. He goes back to the passenger compartment where beds have been made up and people are turning in for the night -- except for Crimp who plans to stay up and make sure Vasquez doesn't \\"go for a walk\\" -- thus cheating the hangman and himself out of $5,000.Pete tucks his young charge in for the night and helps him say his prayers (something Pete is unfamiliar with). Peggy comes up to the cockpit to visit with Bill, whose rudeness finally makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. When Alice rings for the steward, Joe takes the call and makes a play for her.Next morning the 'plane arrives for a refueling stop in Mexico and the passengers have breakfast. Joe continues to pursue Alice, under the assumption that she is Judson's secretary. Peggy makes another stab at getting Bill to warm to her and is rebuffed again. Then Pete tells her that her help isn't needed when she tries to get Tommy to drink his milk. Peggy's been \\"marked\\" as a loose woman by her fellow travelers who want nothing to do with her.Before boarding the 'plane a reporter confronts Judson and Alice and Joe learns that she is engaged to her \\"boss\\" and they are eloping.As the flight continues and heads into stormy weather the Professor discusses the methods by which a South American tribe of headhunters practice their craft. The conversation is interrupted by a news bulletin which recounts how Tommy's father has been killed. Peggy again tries to help with Tommy, saying \\"he needs a woman.\\" But Pete is still being judgemental and answers \\"he needs a lady.\\" Mrs. Spengler intervenes and comforts Tommy.As the storm they are flying through gets rougher, the passengers strap themselves into their seats and Crimp insists the pilots turn back. As the 'plane rocks back and forth a couple of metal cylinders break loose and crash through the back door. Tommy comes perilously close to going out the door when Llarry saves him and hands him to Pete. Just then the 'plane dips sharply and Larry is tossed out the door to his death. As Joe and Bill try to steady the 'plane Crimp tries to force them to turn back by waving his gun at them.

Rhoda is a minor, so her identity is not revealed to John. After serving her prison sentence, Rhoda does not go to MIT, but becomes a janitor at a local school, wanting to physically clean things with her hands but not do too much thinking.After cleaning a school for a while and hearing more news stories about the approaching mirror Earth, Rhoda visits John's house after he has recovered, thinking she will apologize for the harm she did to him. He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for Maid'n Haven (a New Haven based maid service). John, who has nearly dropped out of his Yale music faculty position and is now living in a depressed and dirty stupor, agrees to Rhoda's offer. When she finishes, John, who still does not know she is the person who killed his wife and son, asks her to come back next week.

Dublin was something of a surprise purchase for United, after Ferguson had tried to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton but lost out to Blackburn Rovers.  He scored in United's fourth Premier League game of the 1992-93 season, a last minute winner in United's first Premier league victory - 1-0 against Southampton at The Dell. However, on 2 September, he suffered a broken leg against Crystal Palace in a 1-0 win at Old Trafford, after a tackle by Eric Young, and was out of action for six months. By the time he had recovered, however, United had signed Eric Cantona and the Frenchman was firmly established as first choice strike partner to Mark Hughes. United won the league that season for the first time since 1967, but Dublin failed to make the 10 Premier League appearances required to automatically gain a title winner's medal. However, he was given a medal as a result of special dispensation from the Premier League.  In the 1993-94 season, Dublin regained his fitness, but his first team chances were restricted by partnership of Cantona and Hughes. In December 1993, Ferguson agreed a deal with Everton manager Howard Kendall, that would have seen Dublin moving to Goodison Park, but a member of Everton's board of directors, apparently feeling that Dublin was not worth the money Kendall had offered United, intervened to prevent the transfer going through - this incident led directly to Kendall's resignation as Everton manager and Dublin ended up staying at Old Trafford until the end of the season.  He managed five league appearances that season, scoring once in a 3-2 home win over Oldham Athletic in early April. He also managed a further goal in the Football League Cup second round first leg, as United were beaten 2-1 by Stoke City at the Victoria Ground. The goal against Oldham was the only competitive goal that Dublin scored for United at Old Trafford. He was left out of the FA Cup winning team, and failed to make enough appearances to merit another Premier League title winners medal, and shortly after the start of the 1994-95 season, he was sold to Coventry City for PS2 million.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"he suffered a broken leg against Crystal Palace in a 1-0 win at Old Trafford, after a tackle","rationale":"Obviously, the answer is \\"he suffered a broken leg against Crystal Palace in a 1-0 win at Old Trafford, after a tackle\\"."},{"source":"Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type.

The proposed mechanism of action involves CsA binding to Leishmania major-expressed cyclophilin and subsequent down-regulation of signaling events necessary for establishing productive infection. Recently, we identified a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein, CD147, as a signaling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins in mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that, while being enzymatically active, the Leishmania cyclophilin, unlike its human homologue, does not interact with CD147 on the cell surface of target cells. CD147 facilitates neither Leishmania binding nor infection. Primary structure and biochemical analyses revealed that the parasite's cyclophilin is defective in heparan binding, an event required for signaling interaction between CD147 and human cyclophilin. When the heparan-binding motif was reconstituted in Leishmania cyclophilin, it regained the CD147-dependent signaling activity. These results underscore a critical role of cyclophilinheparan interactions in CD147-mediated signaling events and argue against the role of Leishmania cyclophilin in parasite binding to target cells.","target":"Functional analysis of Leishmania major cyclophilin","rationale":"The paper is about the analysis of Leishmania major cyclophilin.

We propose the weight-dropped LSTM, which uses DropConnect on hidden-to-hidden weights, as a form of recurrent regularization. Further, we introduce NT-ASGD, a non-monotonically triggered  (NT) variant of the averaged stochastic gradient method (ASGD), wherein the averaging trigger is determined using a NT condition as opposed to being tuned by the user. Using these and other regularization strategies, our ASGD Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM) achieves state-of-the-art word level perplexities on two data sets: 57.3 on Penn Treebank and 65.8 on WikiText-2. In exploring the effectiveness of a neural cache in conjunction with our proposed model, we achieve an even lower state-of-the-art perplexity of 52.8 on Penn Treebank and 52.0 on WikiText-2. We also explore the viability of the proposed regularization and optimization strategies in the context of the quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN) and demonstrate comparable performance to the AWD-LSTM counterpart.

He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives.\\nThe Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

From 1902, he was a professional revolutionary, normally based in Cracow, under Austrian rule, organising the transport of illegal literature across the Russian border. In August 1903, as a member of the Main Administration of the SDKPiL, he was one of two Polish delegates to the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in Brussels. The Congress later adjourned to London, under pressure from the Belgian police, and there the RSDLP split into its Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, but Hanecki and the other Polish delegate, Adolf Warski, did not make the journey to London, having failed to agree terms on which the RSDLP and SDKPiL could collaborate.\\n Links: a.

He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history. For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy.\\n\\nEakins has been credited with having \\"introduced the camera to the American art studio\\". During his study abroad, he was exposed to the use of photography by the French realists, though the use of photography was still frowned upon as a shortcut by traditionalists.  In the late 1870s, Eakins was introduced to the photographic motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge, particularly the equine studies, and became interested in using the camera to study sequential movement. In the mid-1880s, Eakins worked briefly alongside Muybridge in the latter's photographic studio at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Eakins soon performed his own independent motion studies, also usually involving the nude figure, and even developed his own technique for capturing movement on film. Whereas Muybridge's system relied on a series of cameras triggered to produce a sequence of individual photographs, Eakins preferred to use a single camera to produce a series of exposures superimposed on one negative. Eakins was more interested in precision measurements on a single image to aid in translating a motion into a painting, while Muybridge preferred separate images that could also be displayed by his primitive movie projector.  After Eakins obtained a camera in 1880, several paintings, such as Mending the Net (1881) and Arcadia (1883), are known to have been derived at least in part from his photographs. Some figures appear to be detailed transcriptions and tracings from the photographs by some device like a magic lantern, which Eakins then took pains to cover up with oil paint. Eakins' methods appear to be meticulously applied, and rather than shortcuts, were likely used in a quest for accuracy and realism.  An excellent example of Eakins' use of this new technology is his painting A May Morning in the Park, which relied heavily on photographic motion studies to depict the true gait of the four horses pulling the coach of patron Fairman Rogers. But in typical fashion, Eakins also employed wax figures and oil sketches to get the final effect he desired.  The so-called \\"Naked Series\\", which began in 1883, were nude photos of students and professional models which were taken to show real human anatomy from several specific angles, and were often hung and displayed for study at the school. Later, less regimented poses were taken indoors and out, of men, women, and children, including his wife. The most provocative, and the only ones combining males and females, were nude photos of Eakins and a female model (see below). Although witnesses and chaperones were usually on site, and the poses were mostly traditional in nature, the sheer quantity of the photos and Eakins' overt display of them may have undermined his standing at the Academy. In all, about eight hundred photographs are now attributed to Eakins and his circle, most of which are figure studies, both clothed and nude, and portraits. No other American artist of his time matched Eakins' interest in photography, nor produced a comparable body of photographic works.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Thomas Eakins","rationale":"The text gives us information about the life and works of Thomas Eakins.

Three windmills  were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97.\\n\\"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \\"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital.\\nWith wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power.\\nNow turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption.\\nThough considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \\"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares.\\nEach share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. \\"There are a lot of things you...\\nQuestion: Denmark has decided to build windmills in its capital mainly to   _  .\\n- make windmills its cultural symbol\\n- advocate an environmentally-friendly lifestyle\\n- take advantage of its limited wind power\\n- greet tourists coming to Copenhagen by plane","target":"advocate an environmentally-friendly lifestyle","rationale":"The article describes Denmark's plan to build windmills in its capital, Copenhagen.

In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940.
