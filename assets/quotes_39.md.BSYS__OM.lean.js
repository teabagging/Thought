The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\n\\nQuestion: Of the 2,900 prisoners, who will be released?\\nI found this answer \\"Sick prisoners\\".

Some historians assert that ninety percent of their inscriptions are in the Kannada language while the remaining are in Sanskrit language. More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the 12th century, many of which have been deciphered and translated by historians of the Archaeological Survey of India. Inscriptions were generally either on stone (Shilashasana) or copper plates (Tamarashasana). This period saw the growth of Kannada as a language of literature and poetry, impetus to which came from the devotional movement of the Virashaivas (called Lingayatism) who expressed their closeness to their deity in the form of simple lyrics called Vachanas. At an administrative level, the regional language was used to record locations and rights related to land grants. When bilingual inscriptions were written, the section stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without any ambiguity.In addition to inscriptions, chronicles called Vamshavalis were written to provide historical details of dynasties. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. In Kannada, writings on secular subjects became popular.

He was the scourge of Democratic Representative \\"Boss\\" Tweed and the Tammany Hall Democratic party political machine.\\nContext: In February 1860, he went to England for the New York Illustrated News to depict one of the major sporting events of the era, the prize fight between the American John C. Heenan and the English Thomas Sayers sponsored by George Wilkes, publisher of Wilkes' Spirit of the Times. A few months later, as artist for The Illustrated London News, he joined Garibaldi in Italy. Nast's cartoons and articles about the Garibaldi military campaign to unify Italy captured the popular imagination in the U.S. In February 1861, he arrived back in New York. In September of that year, he married Sarah Edwards, whom he had met two years earlier.  He left the New York Illustrated News to work again, briefly, for Frank Leslie's Illustrated News. In 1862, he became a staff illustrator for Harper's Weekly. In his first years with Harper's, Nast became known especially for compositions that appealed to the sentiment of the viewer. An example is \\"Christmas Eve\\" (1862), in which a wreath frames a scene of a soldier's praying wife and sleeping children at home; a second wreath frames the soldier seated by a campfire, gazing longingly at small pictures of his loved ones. One of his most celebrated cartoons was \\"Compromise with the South\\" (1864), directed against those in the North who opposed the prosecution of the American Civil War. He was known for drawing battlefields in border and southern states. These attracted great attention, and Nast was called by President Abraham Lincoln \\"our best recruiting sergeant\\".  After the war, Nast strongly opposed the Reconstruction policy of President Andrew Johnson, whom he depicted in a series of trenchant cartoons that marked \\"Nast's great beginning in the field of caricature\\".\\nQuestion: What is meant by Nast's great beginning in the field of caricature?.

Cyclin D1, an EGFR target gene, is frequently overexpressed in HNSCC, has been implicated in its pathogenesis, and is strongly associated with poor prognosis in this disease. Therefore, we examined the relationship between deregulated cyclin D1 expression and sensitivity to gefitinib to determine whether this frequently occurring oncogenic change affected the cellular response to gefitinib.', 'A panel of six EGFR-overexpressing HNSCC cell lines was used to correlate CCND1 gene copy number, cyclin D1 expression, and response to gefitinib. The effect of constitutive overexpression of cyclin D1 was assessed by establishing stably transfected clonal SCC-9 cell lines.', 'Three of six cell lines displayed cyclin D1 amplification and/or overexpression, and these cell lines were resistant to gefitinib. SCC 9 clones overexpressing cyclin D1 continued to proliferate and maintained their S-phase fraction when treated with gefitinib, whereas empty vector control clones and the parental SCC 9 cells were profoundly inhibited and displayed marked reductions in S-phase. The resistance of cyclin D1-overexpressing clones and cyclin D1-amplified cell lines was associated with maintenance of cyclin D1 expression after gefitinib treatment.\\\\Question: Is deregulated cyclin D1 expression associated with decreased efficacy of the selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines?","target":"These data suggest that deregulated cyclin D1 overexpression may be associated with resistance of HNSCC to EGFR inhibitors.

It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\\n\\n- A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in \\nmoving a product or service from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains.\\n\\n- Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.\\n\\n- Lithuanians (singular \\"lietuvis/lietuv\\") are a Baltic ethnic group, native to Lithuania, where they number around 2,561,300 people. Another million or more make up the Lithuanian diaspora, largely found in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Russia, United Kingdom and Ireland. Their native language is Lithuanian, one of only two surviving members of the Baltic language family. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Most Lithuanians belong to the Roman Catholic Church, while the Lietuvininkai who lived in the northern part of East Prussia prior to World War II, were mostly Evangelical Lutherans.\\n\\n- Norsk Hydro ASA (often referred to as just \\"Hydro\\") is a Norwegian aluminium and renewable energy company, headquartered in Oslo. Hydro is one of the largest aluminium companies worldwide. It has operations in some 50 countries around the world and is active on all continents. The Norwegian state owns 43.8% of the company through the Ministry of Trade and Industry. A further 6.5% is owned by Folketrygdfond, which administers the Government Pension Fund of Norway. Norsk Hydro employs approximately 12,500 people. Svein Richard Brandtzæg has been the CEO since 2009.\\n\\n- Latvia, officially the Republic of Latvia, is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe, one of the three Baltic states. It is bordered by Estonia to the north, Lithuania to the south, Russia to the east, and Belarus to the southeast, as well as a maritime border to the west alongside Sweden. Latvia has 1,957,200 inhabitants and a territory of . The country has a temperate seasonal climate.\\n\\n- Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.\\n\\n- Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.\\n\\n- Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.\\n\\n- A \\"retailer\\" or a \\"shop\\" is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods. Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. In some contexts it may be considered a leisure activity as well as an economic one.\\n\\n- Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\\n\\n- An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since \\"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\\", the term \\"official language\\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government.\\n\\n- Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual.\\nAdvertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\".\\n\\n- Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.\\n\\n- Uno-X is a chain of unmanned fuel stations throughout Norway and Denmark. It is operated as the low-cost section of YX Energi. The chain was originally created as a low cost chain in Denmark in the late 1950s. The rights to use the name in Sweden were sold to Britain's Burmah Oil. In 1991 Norsk Hydro acquired the 330 outlets of the Danish operation and five years later it bought the Swedish Uno-X chain from Burmah. \\n\\n- Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\\n\\n- The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\\n\\n- YX Energi, formerly known as Hydro Texaco, is a Norwegian and Danish gas station chain formed after the merge of the Hydro and Texaco gas station chains in 1995. In 2006 the company was bought by Reitangruppen and incorporated into their chain including the implementation of 7-Eleven brand on the service stations. Uno-X and Rema Bensin are low-cost brand names of YX.\\n\\n- A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.\\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...\\n\\n- Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin.\\n\\n- Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'reitan group' has the relation 'field of work' with?","target":"distribution","rationale":"The rationale to choose \\"\\"distribution\\"\\" is that:\\n\\"Reitan Group or Reitangruppen (English: \\"the reital group\\") is a Norwegian wholesaler and retail franchiser.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

SARS-CoV-infected macaques developed a disease comparable to SARS in humans; the virus was re-isolated from these animals and they developed SARS-CoV-specific antibodies. This completed the fulfilment of Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers for viral diseases, for SARS-CoV as the aetiological agent of SARS. Besides the macaque model, a ferret and a cat model for SARS-CoV were also developed. These animal models allow comparative pathogenesis studies for SARS-CoV infections and testing of different intervention strategies. The first of these studies has shown that pegylated interferon-␣, a drug approved for human use, limits SARS-CoV replication and lung damage in experimentally infected macaques. Finally, we argue that, given the worldwide nature of the socio-economic changes that have predisposed for the emergence of SARS and avian influenza in Southeast Asia, such changes herald the beginning of a global trend for which we are ill prepared. \\n Title: The aetiology of SARS: Koch's postulates fulfilled","target":"False","rationale":"The given title is completely irrelevant for the given paragraph.

Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920.

However, only running increased cardiac muscle efficiency because it involved faster contraction than lifting weights (which involves slow movements). Thus, in regard to increasing their heart's pumping ability or cardiac muscle efficiency so that more blood can be pumped through the body with greater ease with less fatigue, only one group had such improvement: the Brown Group which engaged in running exercise as opposed to weightlifting from the Blue Group"},{"source":"Combine facts and answer this: In which state did John Flammang Schrank from New York attempt to assassinate Republican president Theodore Roosevelt in October 1912?","target":"Wisconsin","rationale":"Wisconsin is the answer because John Flammang Schrank attempted to assassinate Republican president Theodore Roosevelt in October 1912, and he was from New York.\\nA more detailed summary of this information can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Schrank"},{"source":"Choose your answer from options.

Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins.

Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.\\n\\n- Monterrey, is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo León, in Mexico. The city is anchor to the third-largest metropolitan area in Mexico and is ranked as the ninth-largest city in the nation. Monterrey serves as a commercial center in the north of the country and is the base of many significant international corporations.\\n\\n- Guadalajara is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Jalisco, and the seat of the municipality of Guadalajara.

From north to south, it runs for approximately 200 km from Dangriga, Belize, to La Ceiba, Honduras.\\n\\n- Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages. Convergent evolution creates analogous structures that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. The cladistic term for the same phenomenon is homoplasy. The recurrent evolution of flight is a classic example, as flying insects, birds, and bats have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are \\"analogous\\", whereas \\"homologous\\" structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions. Bird, bat and pterosaur wings are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.\\n\\n- The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.\\n\\n- Honduras, officially the Republic of Honduras, is a republic in Central America. It has at times been referred to as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from British Honduras, which became modern-day Belize.

They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring . Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5-cm bee hummingbird weighing less than a U.S. penny (2.5 g).\\n\\n- Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset.\\n\\n- The Sphingidae are a family of moths (Lepidoptera), commonly known as hawk moths, sphinx moths, and hornworms; it includes about 1,450 species. It is best represented in the tropics, but species are found in every region. They are moderate to large in size and are distinguished among moths for their rapid, sustained flying ability. Their narrow wings and streamlined abdomens are adaptations for rapid flight.\\nSome hawk moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth or the white-lined sphinx, hover in midair while they feed on nectar from flowers, so are sometimes mistaken for hummingbirds. This hovering capability is only known to have evolved four times in nectar feeders: in hummingbirds, certain bats, hoverflies, and these sphingids (an example of convergent evolution). Sphingids have been much studied for their flying ability, especially their ability to move rapidly from side to side while hovering, called 'swing-hovering' or 'side-slipping'. This is thought to have evolved to deal with ambush predators that lie in wait in flowers.\\n\\n- Lintneria lugens is a moth of the Sphingidae family . It is known from Mexico , Honduras and Nicaragua . It is similar to Lintneria eremitus , but larger . There are small black spots on the pale abdomen underside . The forewing upperside is blackish grey and there are two narrow , faint median bands on the forewing underside . There is one generation per year with adults on wing from July to September . The larvae feed on Wigandia urens .\\n\\n- Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.\\n\\n- The hummingbird hawk-moth (\\"Macroglossum stellatarum\\") is a species of moth.\\n\\n- The tropics are a region of the Earth surrounding the equator. They are delimited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere at  N and the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere at  S; these latitudes correspond to the axial tilt of the Earth. The tropics are also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone (see geographical zone). The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun is at a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year (which is a subsolar point).\\n\\n- An isthmus (or ; plural: isthmuses; from ) is a narrow piece of land connecting two larger areas across an expanse of water that otherwise separates them. A tombolo is an isthmus that consists of a spit or bar, and a strait is the sea counterpart of an isthmus.\\n\\n- Nicaragua, officially the Republic of Nicaragua, is the largest country in the Central American isthmus. Nicaragua's capital, Managua, is the country's largest city and the third-largest city in Central America. The multi-ethnic population of six million includes indigenous peoples, Europeans, Africans, and Asians. The main language is Spanish. Native tribes on the eastern coast speak their own languages.\\n\\n- Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.\\n\\n- Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City.\\n\\n- The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.\\n\\n- Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, and bats. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, \\"A. m. scutellata\\" and the western honey bee.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'lintneria lugens' and 'sphinx'?","target":"parent taxon","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"parent taxon\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you will be given two sentences separated by \\"because\\".

He was especially afraid of thunderstorms. At the first flash of lightning or crash of thunder, he would run whining into his house and hide under a table.\\nI often went for a walk with Howard. Once, as we were walking along a road, it began to rain. I quickly ran to a bus stop for shelter. The bus stop had a roof supported by metal poles. Soon after I had got there, Howard caught my trousers in his teeth and tried to pull me away. At first I was puzzled and a little angry at his behavior. But I decided to humor him and walked away from the shelter into the rain and started to go home.\\nWhen I was about two hundred metres from the shelter, there came a flash of lightning and soon after, there was thunder which nearly deafened me. Howard stopped walking and began whining. Thinking he was afraid, I bent to pick him up. As I straightened up, I glanced at the bus shelter we had just left. I was shocked to see that two of the poles were bent and the roof was lying on the ground, broken. The shelter had been struck by the bolt of lightning!\\nQuestion: The reason why the author was puzzled and angry with the dog was that  _  .\\nOptions: A: Howard had a strange behavior\\nB: Howard should be afraid of the metal poles\\nC: Howard should know the approaching of the terrible lightning\\nD: Howard bit his trousers in his teeth","target":"A","rationale":"The article says that the author was puzzled and a little angry at Howard's behavior, but he decided to humor him anyway.

After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to \\"play this tune as though you've never heard it before.\\" A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.A late piece of Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books.\\nIn his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion.

CADASIL progresses, in some cases, to subcortical dementia with a particular cognitive impairment. Different diseases in the dementia spectrum share a central cholinergic and sensorimotor plasticity alteration. We aimed to study different intracortical circuits and sensorimotor plasticity in CADASIL patients using transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols, and to determine whether these characteristics correlated with the results of clinical neuropsychological evaluation. Ten CADASIL patients and 10 healthy subjects were included in the study. All subjects underwent a transcranial magnetic stimulation study examining different intracortical circuits. Sensorimotor plasticity was also assessed using a paired associative stimulation and extensive neuropsychological tests. CADASIL patients showed a lack of intracortical facilitation, short latency afferent inhibition and sensorimotor plasticity when compared with control subjects. CADASIL patients also showed an altered neuropsychological profile. Correlation between sensorimotor plasticity and neuropsychological alterations was observed in CADASIL patients. These results suggest that acetylcholine and glutamate could be involved in the dementia process in CADASIL and that abnormal sensorimotor plasticity correlates with the neuropsychological profile in CADASIL patients. \\n Question: Which gene is involved in CADASIL?","target":"notch3 gene","rationale":"The answer to the question is \\"notch3 gene\\"."},{"source":"Given a statement, generate a question such that the answer is contained in that statement.\\n\\nteeth also make sharks excellent predators.","target":"What kind of predator does teeth make?","rationale":"The question should induce teeth as an example of a predator.

The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia. Their confederation of States became today's Negeri Sembilan (\\"Nine States\\"), with Seremban as its capital. The name Minangkabau itself means roughly \\"buffalo horns\\" and is reflected in the distinctive upward curving roof in museums and government offices built in the traditional Minangkabau style. The Bugis were energetic merchants and great sailors. With the Dutch concentrating once more on Java and the Moluccas in the 18th century, the Bugis took advantage of the vacuum by raiding Perak and Kedah, imposing their chieftains in Selangor and becoming the power behind the throne in Johor. The Bugis in Johor's administration provided much of the spirit in that State's independent stand in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal.

Wisdom has been regarded as one of four cardinal virtues; and as a virtue, it is a habit or disposition to perform the action with the highest degree of adequacy under any given circumstance with the limitation of error in any given action. This implies a possession of knowledge, or the seeking of knowledge to apply to the given circumstance. This involves an understanding of people, objects, events, situations, and the willingness as well as the ability to apply perception, judgement, and action in keeping with the understanding of what is the optimal course of action. It often requires control of one's emotional reactions (the \\"passions\\") so that the universal principle of reason prevails to determine one's action. In short, wisdom is a disposition to find the truth coupled with an optimum judgement as to what actions should be taken.\\n\\n- The President of Vanuatu is the head of state of Vanuatu .

In fact, for one model in particular, BigGAN, metrics such as Inception Score or Frechet Inception Distance nearly match those of the dataset, suggesting that these models are close to match-ing the distribution of the training set.    Given the quality of these models,  it is worth understanding to what extent these samples can be used for data augmentation, a task expressed as a long-term goal of the GAN research project.   To that end, we train ResNet-50 classifiers using either purely BigGAN images or mixtures of ImageNet and BigGAN images, and test on the ImageNet validation set. Our  preliminary  results  suggest  both a measured view of  state-of-the-art  GAN quality and highlight limitations of current metrics. Using only BigGAN images, we find that Top-1 and Top-5 error increased by 120% and 384%, respectively, and furthermore, adding more BigGAN data to the ImageNet training set at best only marginally improves classifier performance. Finally, we find that neither Inception Score, nor FID, nor combinations thereof are predictive of classification accuracy.    These results suggest that as GANs are beginning to be deployed in downstream tasks, we should create metrics that better measure downstream task performance.   We propose classification performance as one such metric that, in addition to assessing per-class sample quality, is more suited to such downstream tasks.","target":"BigGANs do not capture the ImageNet data distributions and are only modestly successful for data augmentation","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nBigGANs do not capture the ImageNet data distributions and are only modestly successful for data augmentation."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a context sentence containing a blank (_).

They rely on their well-developed sonar to find their way in the water. Toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted. All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure. Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and beaked whales (ziphiids). There are six species, sometimes referred to as \\"blackfish\\", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).The differences between families of odontocetes include size, feeding adaptations and distribution.\\nMonodontids consist of two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both reside in the frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their coloration acting as camouflage.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis.

Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.\\n\\n- Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.\\n\\n- The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

He was the son of Offa , the greatest king of Mercia , and Cynethryth . In 787 , Ecgfrith had been consecrated king , the first known consecration of an English king , probably arranged by Offa in imitation of the consecration of Charlemagne 's sons by the pope in 781 . According to the Croyland Chronicle \`\` he ( Ecgfrith ) was seized with a malady , and departed this life . '' His reign lasted 141 days . Ecgfrith was succeeded by a distant relative , Cœnwulf , presumably because Offa had arranged the murder of nearer relatives in order to eliminate dynastic rivals . According to a contemporary letter from Alcuin of York , an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at Charlemagne 's court as one of his chief advisors : That most noble young man has not died for his sins , but the vengeance for the blood shed by the father has reached the son . For you know how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom upon his son . Alcuin added : \`\` This was not a strengthening of the kingdom , but its ruin . ''\\n\\n- Offa was King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 until his death in July 796. The son of Thingfrith and a descendant of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of Æthelbald. Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred. In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended Mercian supremacy over most of southern England, allying with Beorhtric of Wessex, who married Offa's daughter Eadburh, and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of East Anglia and had King Æthelberht II of East Anglia beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.\\n\\n- In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'ecgfrith of mercia' with the relationship of 'father'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- charlemagne\\n - discovery\\n - holy roman emperor\\n - include\\n - julius caesar\\n - octavian\\n - offa of mercia\\n - zeno\\n - æthelberht","target":"offa of mercia","rationale":"The answer is offa of mercia."},{"source":"who plays the neighbor brenda on young sheldon??","target":"Melissa Peterman","rationale":"The answer is based on the fact that Melissa Peterman plays Brenda, a neighbor of Sheldon Cooper's family who appears in Young Sheldon."},{"source":"You are given a short poem which is written by a kid.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. Methods: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 μg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. Results: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV 1 by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. Conclusions and clinical relevance: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \\nQuestion: According to legend, the lost civilization of Atlantis was located on or near what archipelago? \\nIs the correct answer Portugal?","target":"No","rationale":"First, \\"Atlantis\\" is the name of a civilization that existed thousands of years ago and was located in an unknown region.

Of all the child workers, the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and emotional abuse they endured by their employers. To address the issue of child labour, the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child Act was implemented in 1959. Yet due to poverty, lack of education and ignorance, the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced or accepted in Africa.\\nWhere did children from rural areas work?","target":"farms","rationale":"Children who grew up in rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour, working with animals and selling crops."},{"source":"What is the answer to this question? when is the new jurassic park movie being released?","target":"June 22, 2018","rationale":"Here's an answer: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is scheduled to be released in the United States on June 22, 2018.\\nThe statement provided by the automatic system that \\"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a 2018 American science fiction action film directed by J.A.

The accumulation of HNE in buffy-coat-reduced red cells may be greater than that of whole blood units. HNE accumulates during storage and its quantity may have pathophysiologic significance. Platelets and plasma derived from buffy coats contain some HNE, but leukocyte-depleted red cells virtually none. However, we consider the accumulation of HNE in these components not to be clinically important. The quantities, kinetics, and occurrence in various blood components of HNE contamination differ from those observed with cytokines.","target":"yes","rationale":"The question asks if leukocyte depletion of red cell components prevents exposure to neutrophil elastase, and the answer states that leukocyte depletion may limit the inadvertent infusion of bioactive substances derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

The Roman sources also use the term Hispani to refer to the Iberians. The term Iberian, as used by the ancient authors, had two distinct meanings. One, more general, referred to all the populations of the Iberian peninsula without regard to ethnic differences (Pre-Indo-European, Celts and non-Celtic Indo-Europeans).\\n\\nThe Iberians produced sculpture in stone and bronze, most of which was much influenced by the Greeks and Phoenicians, and other cultures such as Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian influences. The styles of Iberian sculpture are divided geographically into Levantine, Central, Southern, and Western groups, of which the Levantine group displays the most Greek influence. Iberian pottery and painting was also distinct and widespread throughout the region.  The Iberian polytheistic religion was influenced by the Greek and Phoenician practices, as it is evident in their sculptures. The man-bull Bicha of Balazote (possibly a fertility deity) and various depictions of sphinxes and lions bear a resemblance to eastern Mediterranean mythological creatures. The Lady of Elche and Lady of Guardamar show clear Hellenistic influence. Phoenician and Greek deities like Tanit, Baal, Melkart, Artemis, Demeter and Asclepius were known in the region and worshiped. Currently few native Iberian gods are known, though the oracular healing deity \\"Betatun\\" is known from a Latin inscription at Fuertes del Rey. There was clearly an important female deity associated with the earth and regeneration as depicted by the Lady of Baza and linked with birds, flowers and wheat. The horse was also an important religious figure and an important sanctuary dedicated to Horses has been found in Mula (Murcia). There are many depictions of a \\"horse taming god\\" or \\"lord of the horses\\" (despotes hippon). The female goddess Ataegina is also widely attested in the inscriptions.  Iberians performed their rites in the open and also maintained sanctuaries in holy places like groves, springs and caves. Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of a priestly class and Silius Italicus mentions priests in the region of Tartessos at a temple of Melqart. Evidence from pottery reveals some information about Iberian myth and ritual. Common themes are a celebratory ritual dance described by Strabo [c.f. 3.3.7.] and seen in a relief from Fuerte del Rey known as the \\"Bastetania dance\\" and the confrontation between the deceased and a wolf figure. Ritual sacrifice of animals was also common.  The Iberians incinerated their dead and placed their ashes in ceremonial urns, the remains were then placed in stone tombs.  Iberians venerated the war god Cariociecus.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Iberians","rationale":"The given text is about the ancient Iberians who lived in Spain and Portugal.

Counterattacks were mounted by general Müller von der Lühnen, who lifted the siege laid on Greifswald by the Brandenburgian prince elector, and major general Paul Wirtz, who from besieged Stettin managed to capture the Brandenburgian ammunition depot at Curau and took it to Stralsund. The Brandenburgians withdrew ravaging the countryside while retreating. In the occupied and annexed Danish provinces, guerilla movements pressed Swedish garrisons.

Chris leaves his address at the home of Edgar Frog, the town's surfboard shaper, in hopes of getting a job. Chris is approached at their new home by former pro surfer, Shane Powers (played by Angus Sutherland the half brother of Kiefer Sutherland who played David from the original film), who invites him to a party that night.\\nChris and Nicole go to the party, where Shane and his friends Kyle, Erik and Jon are entertaining themselves with the human guests. Chris showers with a girl named Lisa and Shane gets Nicole alone, chats with her for a bit, and then tricks her into drinking his blood. When Chris learns that Nicole has been with Shane, he angrily, and protectively, takes her home, where she begins to manifest vampiric strength and rage. But before Nicole kills Chris, she is knocked out by Edgar, who reveals that he is a vampire hunter, and Nicole has been infected with vampirism. Chris throws Edgar out of the house. Then, Lisa shows up and pretends to chat with Chris for a bit before she finally tries to seduce and feed on him. In fending her off, he accidentally impales her on a mounted rack of antlers, killing her explosively when she turns into stone and explodes.\\nFinally convinced of the situation, remembering what Edgar said and believing that he was right, Chris seeks out Edgar's help. Edgar explains that Nicole is only half-vampire, and will remain that way unless she feeds, and she can be turned human again if they kill the head vampire before that. Chris interrupts her just before she can feed on Evan Monroe, a nice guy who has been courting her, and explains what is happening to her, and Nicole is surprised at what she almost did (because she believes herself to be a vegetarian). However, Shane draws her to their lair and they have sex.","target":"Lisa","rationale":"In the context of the paragraph it is mentioned that Chris Emerson impales a rack of antlers on Lisa.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel...\\nBased on the previous passage, Why did Brazil declare independence when it did? \\nIs \\"It won war, 1820\\" a correct answer?","target":"No","rationale":"The passage shows that at the time of Brazil's declaration of independence, there was a dispute over the Portuguese crown between Pedro IV and his brother Miguel. It also states that other countries became involved because this monarchy crisis had strong \\"overtones of absolutism versus liberalism\\". Due to these two elements present in Portugal at the time, it can be inferred that Portugal lacked unity among its ruling class which is why they were unable to control their colony declaring independence.\\nTherefore, while it may have been true as well that Brazil won war against them during 1820s but since we are given no evidence regarding what happened before or after then so we can't say for sure if this answer would make sense based on just one sentence from an entire passage.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states:\\n“Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.”\\nYet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...\\nQuestion: What does competition between providers cause?\\nOptions:\\n- Increased casualisation of the education sector \\n - Great choice of more innovative and better quality products \\n - not enough information \\n - Services at the same cost\\n===\\nThe correct answer is","target":"Great choice of more innovative and better quality products","rationale":"Q: What does competition between providers cause?\\nA1.

The Liberal-Country Coalition was returned with control of the Senate. The Government was returned again in the 1954 election; the formation of the anti-Communist Democratic Labor Party (DLP) and the consequent split in the Australian Labor Party early in 1955 helped the Liberals to another victory in December 1955. John McEwen replaced Arthur Fadden as leader of the Country Party in March 1958 and the Menzies-McEwen Coalition was returned again at elections in November 1958 – their third victory against Labor's H. V. Evatt. The Coalition was narrowly returned against Labor's Arthur Calwell in the December 1961 election, in the midst of a credit squeeze. Menzies stood for office for the last time in the November 1963 election, again defeating Calwell, with the Coalition winning back its losses in the House of Representatives.

She recounted this story to me and it has been ongoing for a couple of weeks now. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo to start things off my friend (21), upon finding a relatively lucrative job following leaving school has found herself in a position of some financial stability, though is by no means financially independent as she has to support her household a lot, and is presently one of two of the six of her dads children who can drive. If she wants something then she can buy it, and she lives at home with two of her siblings whilst contributing towards the upkeep for her home significantly. Her family are all either her age or older aside from her younger sister (16) and half have reasonable jobs which keep them afloat, the other half do not and get a lot from welfare. Since she has a well paying job her family use her as effectively their personal ATM, all of them constantly ask her if they can borrow money as well as effectively demanding lifts from her; if she refuses then they get pretty annoyed. They take her very much for granted, and expect her to do things for them without any consideration of her life or her feelings. One example of which for perspective, is one of her sisters asking her for a lift to the shops which are a 10 minute walk with her three children for a quick shopping trip, then leaving them in the car with my her to mind for **an hour** (which she didn't say she was going to do) whilst she went and did whatever shopping she needed to do. My friend then gave them all a lift to their dad's house which she didn't mind, but as soon as her sister wanted to leave she expected my friend to drop what she was doing and take her back without having even asked, no please and no thank you. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow this is not to say my friend won't do all these things, as they're her family she tries to help them all out as best she can but on the whole they are all very ungrateful for the things she does for them. It frustrates her when they take liberties and expect things from her without actually considering to ask. A couple of them will often get her to give them money by saying it's because they can't afford things for their children, even though she lends the money with that purpose which they then spend of doing things for themselves. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow with that in mind, this Christmas as my friend was doing financially okay she wasn't particularly concerned about the gifts she received and so said to each of her family members that in lieu of buying everyone a present this year she would donate to a charity of their choice instead. She said she didn't need a present herself, and so if they wanted to do that as well they could. The previous year she had bought her brother a lamp as his present, so to her this made a lot more sense as someone else would get a lot more use out of it. What's more is that one of her nephews is critically ill with a heart defect, and so charity to their family is important as it's helping to fund research for the treatment he needs. It's worth noting here this is in England so other than travelling to different hospitals (which my friend has to do for her sister 99% of the time, missing work because the other drivers in the family won't do it), there are no costs. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen she announced that this is what she would be doing, **shit hit the fan**. She received tirades of abusive texts, all with the theme that she doesn't get to decide that their presents should be given to charity. Her parents argument was that she should have just left it at her presents from them being donated, not both ways. She maintains this is what she's going to do, but she will buy something for her dad, which I wholeheartedly support as he works hard to help her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI personally think that it's a fantastic idea and that with the amount that she does for them everyday is Christmas. Having said that, I would be very selfishly disappointed not to receive presents of Christmas from my siblings. Whatever she would have got them though with the amount she would have spent, they can all easily buy the same for themselves as through either work or benefits they do have enough money to cover the cost of her gift.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo yeah, is she the asshole for not buying her siblings tangible Christmas gifts? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**tl;dr incredibly generous friend decided to donate to charity rather than buying her siblings presents and suggests they do the same, is effectively branded an asshole**","target":"EVERYBODY","rationale":"The author of the post is supportive of their friend's decision not to buy gifts for her siblings, instead donating the money to charity.

This information is not routinely used by current methods that infer haplotypes from genotype data. We have extended the SHAPEIT2 method to use phase-informative sequencing reads to improve phasing accuracy. Our model incorporates the read information in a probabilistic model through base quality scores within each read. The method is primarily designed for high-coverage sequence data or data sets that already have genotypes called. One important application is phasing of single samples sequenced at high coverage for use in medical sequencing and studies of rare diseases. Our method can also use existing panels of reference haplotypes. We tested the method by using a mother-father-child trio sequenced at high-coverage by Illumina together with the low-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP). We found that use of phase-informative reads increases the mean distance between switch errors by 22% from 274.4 kb to 328.6 kb. We also used male chromosome X haplotypes from the 1000GP samples to simulate sequencing reads with varying insert size, read length, and base error rate. When using short 100 bp paired-end reads, we found that using mixtures of insert sizes produced the best results. When using longer reads with high error rates (5-20 kb read with 4%-15% error per base), phasing performance was substantially improved.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not include a topic sentence, relevant supporting sentences or a closing/transition sentence.

After a scoreless first quarter, Minnesota took first blood as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 41-yard field goal. They increased their lead later in the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 9-yard TD pass. Cincinnati responded with quarterback Carson Palmer finding wide receiver Chad Ochocinco on a 15-yard TD pass, however the Vikings quickly scored two field goals by kicker Ryan Longwell (from 23 and 44 yards out) to put the Vikings up 16-7 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Vikings scored the period's only points as running back Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally with kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Vikings put the game away with running back Adrian Peterson's 3-yard TD run.

As a sophomore, he helped lead the University of North Carolina to an 11-1 Atlantic Coast Conference championship. He played in the 1972 and 1974 Sun Bowls, Hula Bowl, and Senior Bowl in 1975. As a team captain in his senior season, he led an offensive line that produced two 1,000 yard backs and helped Carolina set a school total offense record. He was chosen first Team All-ACC and Consensus All-American in 1974 including Playboy’s Pre-Season All-American pick. Huff was a finalist for the Outland Trophy Award, won the Jacobs Trophy as the league's best blocker, Jim Tatum Medal and was a two time recipient of the Bill Arnold Award as UNC's top lineman. He was also named Captain of the College All-Stars in their game against the Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers, selected to the 75th anniversary All Sun Bowl team in 2008, and listed as one of the top 25 lineman to play in the ACC.

Rundgren was originally concerned that they had taken \\"the worst sounding studio in the city at that time\\" because it was the only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: \\"The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate.\\" New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of $17,000 (equivalent to $96,000 in 2018). With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, \\"we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn't like these people who conceptualize things. It was just a document of what was going on at the time.\\"In the studio, the New York Dolls dressed in their usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did not approve of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the sessions to \\"get the glitter out of your asses and play\\". Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive mixing console, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: \\"It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff.

North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel.

Female territories, which range from 25 to 40 km2 in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory of a male can contain those of several females. The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.Like the other big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn territorial and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that of two or three females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.The jaguar is often described as nocturnal, but is more specifically crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study., can you guess it ?","target":"crepuscular","rationale":"The right answer is crepuscular. The rationale here is that, the article says “the jaguar is often described as nocturnal”, but it further explains that they are more specifically active around dawn and dusk, which means they are most active during twilight (dawn or dusk). This suggests that like many animals who hunt at night or in low light conditions when their prey is less alert to danger from predators such as the jaguar, this big cat prefers to be out hunting for food before sunrise and after sunset when its chances of catching prey increase.\\nSo the answer should be C - crepuscular ."},{"source":"See the multi-choice question below:\\n\\nSentence 1: NHTSA did not conduct an evaluation of the impacts of the rule under the National Environmental Policy Act.\\n\\nSentence 2: The NHTSA evaluated the impacts of all of the rules under the National Environmental Policy Act.\\n\\nIf the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The first sentence states that NHTSA did not conduct an evaluation of the impacts of one specific rule under NEPA while the second sentence states that they conducted such evaluations for all rules.

The band members are known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and flashy wardrobe. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are one of the most successful groups in music history. Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with fewer or more members), the group formed in 1960 in Detroit, Michigan under the name The Elgins.\\nContext: In May 1971, the Temptations finally found a permanent replacement for the first tenor position in twenty-year-old Baltimore native Damon Harris. Otis Williams, Edwards, Franklin, Street, and Harris continued recording and performing, and Norman Whitfield continued producing hits for them. There were Top 40 hits such as \\"Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)\\" (1971), a message from the Temptations to David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks, and \\"Take a Look Around\\" (1972). During this period, the group toured with Quiet Elegance as their back-up singers. Quiet Elegance featured Lois Reeves, the sister of Martha Reeves, alongside Frankie Gearing and Millie Vaney-Scott.  Late 1972 saw the release of \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\", a magnum opus written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong and produced by Whitfield. Originally a three-minute record written and produced for the Undisputed Truth, Whitfield took the somber tune and created a sprawling, dramatic twelve-minute version for the Temptations--a forerunner of the extended single, soon to become popular in clubs and discotheques. An edited seven-minute version was released as a single and became one of the longest hit singles in music history: it hit number 1 on the pop charts and number 5 on the R&B charts. In 1973, \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\" won the Temptations their second Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Group. Whitfield and arranger/conductor Paul Riser won the award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance for the instrumental version on the B-side, and Whitfield and Barrett Strong won the songwriting Grammy for Best R&B Song.  After \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\", Whitfield stopped working with Barrett Strong, and began writing the Temptations' material on his own. The success of \\"Papa\\" led Whitfield to create more elongated, operatic pieces, including the Top 10 hit \\"Masterpiece\\" (1973) and several of the tracks on the resulting Masterpiece album. Tensions developed between Whitfield and the group, who found Whitfield arrogant and difficult to work with, and the group citing his habitual tardiness, his emphasis of the instrumental tracks at the expense of their vocals on many of his productions, and the declining singles and albums sales as other sources of conflict, sought to change producers. Otis Williams complained about Whitfield's actions and the Temptations' stagnant sales to Berry Gordy; as a result, the group was reassigned to Jeffrey Bowen, co-producer of the 1967 In a Mellow Mood album.  The final Norman Whitfield-produced Temptations album, 1990, was released in December 1973, and included the Top 30 single \\"Let Your Hair Down\\". Shortly afterwards, Whitfield left Motown, and in 1975 established Whitfield Records, taking the Undisputed Truth and Willie Hutch with him, along with Rose Royce---who performed an instrumental track for \\"Let Your Hair Down\\" before recording their 1976 smash \\"Car Wash.\\"\\nQuestion: Did it win any awards?.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.","target":"Marisol","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that Chien uses coal to generate electricity and Marisol uses nuclear power plants. It also states that burning fossil fuels causes air pollution, which harms living things, including humans. Since the citizens of Chien use coal to generate their city’s electricity, they are exposed more frequently to harmful pollutants in the atmosphere than those who live near nuclear power plants. Because these harmful pollutants can be avoided by using a different method for generating energy (nuclear power), it is reasonable conclude that the answer should be Marisol because its residents will generally be healthier due to cleaner air quality compared with those from Chien."},{"source":"Premise: well they have the master of liberal arts there and so i thought i would go and do that\\n\\nHypothesis: I would have gone there but they did not have a liberal arts program. \\n\\nDoes the premise entail the hypothesis?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The premise states that the master of liberal arts program is available at a location, yet the hypothesis states that there was no such program.

Therefore, this question essentially asks which of these traits are not inherited from parents (this information can be inferred from the sentence that contains this question). Curly hair and eye color are both traits determined by genetics. Scars do not affect your genes or DNA in any way; instead they indicate wounds on your body that have been healed. So if you get a scar on your arm during childhood and then cut yourself in the same place again when you're an adult, you will most likely get another scar there because our bodies tend to heal wounds in similar ways as we age. However, if someone else were to cut themselves in exactly the same spot as you did when you were a child (and assuming they received appropriate medical care), their body would heal itself differently than yours did due to their genetic makeup. This demonstrates how scars are not inherited from our parents; therefore it is correct answer for this question."},{"source":"The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships? is inside the article: Freedom from Want was published with an essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\".  In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America.  In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty.

In hope of subsidies, Charles XI of Sweden had entered the anti-French Triple Alliance with the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England, which broke apart when Charles II of England rapproached France in 1670, after the War of Devolution. In April 1672, Sweden and France concluded an alliance, with France promising 400,000 riksdalers of subsidies in peace time, to be raised to 600,000 in war time, for Sweden maintaining a 16,000 men strong army in her German dominions. Also, Sweden maintained good relations to the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp south of Denmark. By September 1674, Sweden had enlarged her army to 22,000 men after France had increased the subsidies to 900,000 riksdalers, which she threatened to withdraw if Sweden was not using this army, stationed in Swedish Pomerania, for an attack on her adversaries. By December, the Swedish army had grown to 25,000 to 26,000 men, 4,000 to 5,000 of whom stationed in Bremen, 2,000 to 3,000 in Wismar, 6,000 to 7,000 in Pomeranian garrisons, and 13,000 free to operate under Lord High Constable and field marshal Carl Gustaf Wrangel.\\nHow many years after Charles II of England rapproached France did Sweden and France conclude an alliance?","target":"2","rationale":"In order to answer how many years after Charles II of England rapproached France did Sweden and Frace conclude an alliance, we need to check the time period when they concluded.

Some stories can be traced back to their roots, while the origin of others is uncertain or disputed. England abounds with folklore, in all forms, from such obvious manifestations as the traditional Robin Hood tales, the Brythonic-inspired Arthurian legend, to contemporary urban legends and facets of cryptozoology such as the Beast of Bodmin Moor.\\n\\n- Robin Hood is a heroic outlaw in English folklore who, according to legend, was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. Traditionally depicted as being dressed in Lincoln green, he is often portrayed as \\"robbing from the rich and giving to the poor\\" alongside his band of Merry Men. Robin Hood became a popular folk figure in the late-medieval period, and continues to be widely represented in literature, films and television.\\n\\n- In historical legal systems, an outlaw is declared as outside the protection of the law. In pre-modern societies, the criminal is withdrawn all legal protection, so that anyone is legally empowered to persecute or kill them. Outlawry was thus one of the harshest penalties in the legal system. In early Germanic law, the death penalty is conspicuously absent, and outlawing is the most extreme punishment, presumably amounting to a death sentence in practice. The concept is known from Roman law, as the status of \\"homo sacer\\", and persisted throughout the Middle Ages.\\n\\n- A sword is a long bladed weapon intended for slashing or thrusting. The precise definition of the term varies with the historical epoch or the geographical region under consideration. A sword consists of a long blade attached to a hilt. The blade can be straight or curved. Thrusting swords have a pointed tip on the blade, and tend to be straighter; slashing swords have sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade, and are more likely to be curved. Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing.\\n\\n- Lincoln green is the colour of dyed woollen cloth associated with Robin Hood and his merry men in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. The dyers of Lincoln, a cloth town in the high Middle Ages, produced the cloth by dyeing it with woad (\\"Isatis tinctoria\\") to give it a strong blue, then overdyeing it yellow with weld (\\"Reseda luteola\\") or dyers' broom, \\"Genista tinctoria\\". \\"Coventry blue\\" and \\"Kendall green\\" were also colours linked with the dyers of English towns.\\n\\n- A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a person or main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through impressive feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength, often sacrificing his or her own personal concerns for some greater good.\\n\\n- The Merry Men are the group of outlaws who follow Robin Hood in English literature and folklore .

It is known for musical improvisation, extended jams, blending of genres, and a dedicated fan base. The current line-up--guitarist and lead vocalist Trey Anastasio, bassist and vocalist Mike Gordon, drummer and vocalist Jon Fishman, and keyboardist and vocalist Page McConnell--performed together for 15 years before going on hiatus from October 7, 2000, to December 30, 2002. They resumed touring from December 31, 2002, until August 15, 2004, when they announced that the Coventry Festival would be their last show.\\n\\nPhish was formed at the University of Vermont (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists Trey Anastasio and Jeff Holdsworth, bassist Mike Gordon, and drummer Jon Fishman. For their first gig, at Harris Millis Cafeteria at the University of Vermont on December 2, 1983, the band was billed as \\"Blackwood Convention\\". (\\"Blackwood convention\\" is a term from the card game contract bridge.) The band was joined by percussionist Marc Daubert in the fall of 1984, a time during which they promoted themselves as playing Grateful Dead songs. Daubert left the band early in 1985, and Page McConnell then joined the group on keyboards and made his debut on May 3, 1985, at a show at Wilks/Davis/Wing Dormitory on Redstone Campus at UVM. Holdsworth left the group after graduating in 1986, solidifying the band's lineup of \\"Trey, Page, Mike, and Fish\\"--the lineup to this day.  Following a prank at UVM with his friend and former bandmate Steve Pollak--also known as \\"The Dude of Life\\"--Anastasio decided to leave the college. With the encouragement of McConnell (who received $50 for each transferee), Anastasio and Fishman relocated in mid-1986 to Goddard College, a small school in the hills of Plainfield, Vermont. Phish distributed at least six different experimental self-titled cassettes during this era, including The White Tape. This first studio recording was circulated in two variations: the first, mixed in a dorm room as late as 1985, received a higher distribution than the second studio remix of the original four tracks, c. 1987. The older version was officially released under the title Phish in August 1998.  Jesse Jarnow's book Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America details much of the band's early years at Goddard College, including their early relationship with fellow Goddard students Richard \\"Nancy\\" Wright and Jim Pollock. Pollock and Wright were musical collaborators, experimenting with multi-track cassette records to be broadcast on local radio. Phish adopted a number of Nancy's songs into their own set, including \\"Halley's Comet\\", \\"I Didn't Know\\", and \\"Dear Mrs. Reagan\\", the latter song being written by Nancy and Pollock. Jarnow argues that despite an eventual falling out between the members of Phish and Nancy, Nancy and his music were highly influential to Phish's early style and experimental sound. Pollock continued to collaborate with Phish over the years, designing some of their most iconic concert posters.  The band's actions demonstrate an identity with their \\"hometown\\" of Burlington, Vermont. By 1985, the group had encountered Burlington luthier Paul Languedoc, who would eventually design four guitars for Anastasio and two basses for Gordon. In October 1986, he began working as their sound engineer. Since then, Languedoc has built exclusively for the two, and his designs and traditional wood choices have given Phish a unique instrumental identity. Also during the late 1980s, Phish played regularly at Nectar's restaurant and bar in Burlington. In 1992 the album A Picture of Nectar, named as a tribute to the owner, featured a large orange with Nectar's photo superimposed subtly within the orange.  By late 1990, Phish's concerts were becoming more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special \\"secret language\\", the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band. For instance, if Anastasio \\"teased\\" a motif from The Simpsons theme song, the audience would yell, \\"D'oh!\\" in imitation of  Homer Simpson . In 1992, Phish introduced a collaboration between audience and band called the \\"Big Ball Jam\\" in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit. In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition.  In an experiment known as \\"The Rotation Jam\\", each member would switch instruments with the musician on his left. On occasion, a performance of \\"You Enjoy Myself\\" involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers, jumping on mini-trampolines while simultaneously playing their instruments.  Phish, along with Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, and the Beatles, was one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1991. Aware of the band's growing popularity, Elektra Records signed them that year. The following year A Picture of Nectar was complete: their first major studio release, enjoying far more extensive production than either 1988's Junta or 1990's Lawn Boy. These albums were eventually re-released on Elektra, as well.  The first annual H.O.R.D.E. festival in 1992 provided Phish with their first national tour of major amphitheaters. The lineup, among others, included Phish, Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors, and Widespread Panic. That summer, the band toured Europe with the Violent Femmes and later toured Europe and the U.S. with Carlos Santana.  Phish began headlining major amphitheaters in the summer of 1993. That year, the group released Rift packaged as a concept album and with heavy promotion from Elektra including artwork by David Welker. In 1994, the band released Hoist. To promote the album, the band made their only video for MTV, \\"Down with Disease\\", airing in June of that year. Foreshadowing their future tradition of festivals, Phish coupled camping with their summer tour finale at Sugarbush North in Warren, Vermont, in July 1994, that show eventually being released as Live Phish Volume 2. On Halloween of that year, the group promised to don a fan-selected \\"musical costume\\" by playing an entire album from another band. After an extensive mail-based poll, Phish performed the Beatles' White Album as the second of their three sets at the Glens Falls Civic Center in upstate New York. For their 1994 New Years Run, Phish played the Civic Centers in Philadelphia and Providence as well as sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden and Boston Garden, which were their debuts at each venue. Following the death of Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia in the summer of 1995 and the appearance of \\"Down with Disease\\" on Beavis and Butt-Head, the band experienced a surge in the growth of their fan base and an increased awareness in popular culture.  In their tradition of playing a well-known album by another band for Halloween, Phish contracted a full horn section for their performance of The Who's Quadrophenia in 1995. Their first live album--A Live One--which was released during the summer of 1995, became Phish's first RIAA-certified gold album in November 1995.  Phish retreated to their Vermont recording studio and recorded hours and hours of improvisations, sometimes overlaying them on one another, and included some of the result on the second half of Billy Breathes, which they released in the fall of 1996. Alongside traditional rock-based crescendos, the album has more acoustic guitar than their previous records, and was regarded by the band and some fans as their crowning studio achievement. The album's first single, \\"Free\\", peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, becoming the band's most successful chart single of their career.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Phish","rationale":"The entity is Phish. \\nThis text focuses on the band's history, evolution and activities as a group to such an extent that we can conclude it was written about them."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- In computer science, a syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language.\\n\\n- In computer programming, an indent style is a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey the program's structure. This article largely addresses the free-form languages, such as C programming language and its descendants, but can be (and frequently is) applied to most other programming languages (especially those in the curly bracket family), where whitespace is otherwise insignificant. Indent style is just one aspect of programming style.\\n\\n- Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. \\n\\n- A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit.\\n\\n- A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.\\n\\n- Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm  e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology.\\n\\n- A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.\\n\\n- A bracket is a tall punctuation mark typically used in matched pairs within text, to set apart or interject other text. Used unqualified, brackets refer to different types of brackets in different parts of the world and in different contexts. The matched pair may be described as opening and closing, or left and right symbols.\\n\\n- A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.\\n\\n- Programming style is a set of rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program. It is often claimed that following a particular programming style will help programmers to read and understand source code conforming to the style, and help to avoid introducing errors.\\n\\n- A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. Such programs are sometimes known as \\"notepad\\" software, following the Microsoft Notepad.\\n\\n- A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.\\n\\n- Prettyprint ( or pretty - print ) is the application of any of various stylistic formatting conventions to text files , such as source code , markup , and similar kinds of content . These formatting conventions can adjust positioning and spacing ( indent style ) , add color and contrast ( syntax highlighting ) , adjust size , and make similar modifications intended to make the content easier for people to view , read , and understand . Prettyprinters for programming language source code are sometimes called code beautifiers or syntax highlighters .\\n\\n- Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or markup languages, such as HTML. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.\\n\\n- In computer programming, a free-form language is a programming language in which the positioning of characters on the page in program text is insignificant. Program text does not need to be placed in specific columns as on old punched card systems, and frequently ends of lines are insignificant. Whitespace characters are used only to delimit tokens, and have no other significance.\\n\\n- Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions.\\n\\n- HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\\n\\n- In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed.\\n\\n- In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.\\n\\n- A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the \\"marking up\\" of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.\\n\\n- A programmer, computer programmer, developer, dev, coder, or software engineer is a person who writes computer software. The term \\"computer programmer\\" can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language (Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#, Java, Lisp, Python, etc.) is often prefixed to these titles, and those who work in a Web environment often prefix their titles with \\"Web\\". The term \\"programmer\\" can be used to refer to a software developer, Web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer, software engineer, computer scientist, or software analyst. However, members of these professions possess other software engineering skills, beyond programming; for this reason, the term \\"programmer\\", or \\"code monkey\\", is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory oversimplification of these other professions. This has sparked much debate amongst developers, analysts, computer scientists, programmers, and outsiders who continue to be puzzled at the subtle differences in the definitions of these occupations.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'prettyprint' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of'.

Seven minutes into the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes extended the home team's lead by three via a 50-yard field goal. With a minute to go in the period, Tynes would successfully convert a 23-yard attempt and give the Giants a ten-point lead with a quarter to play.

A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia.

They experimented with a ' stick ' game , based loosely on the rules of association football . Teddington played the game on the smooth outfield of their cricket pitch and used a cricket ball , so allowing smooth and predictable motion . By 1874 they had begun to draw up rules for their game , including banning the raising of the stick above shoulder height and stipulating that a shot at goal must take place within the circle in front of it . An association was formed in 1875 , which dissolved after seven years , but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College , Cambridge .

TL;DR at end.)\\n\\nI’m a chef, I hired this guy as my sous almost two years ago.  He has diabetes.  He’s always sick, especially when it’s really inconvenient, like when I am out of town or when we have really busy weeks with lots of banquets or offsite events.  I brought it up to him in the past, if he thought stress exacerbated it, because whenever we were really busy and I needed his help, boom! in the hospital.\\n\\nEventually, I had to take him off of salary bc he was missing too much work and I told him, you know I don’t wanna fire you, I understand you don’t have control over this, blah blah blah, but I’m not paying you a salary when I can’t depend on you.  So I put him on an hourly wage instead and I promoted one of my other cooks as a sort of junior sous chef so I had a fall back for 1st sous chefs eventual sick days and to ease the stress on 1st sous so he wasn’t pushing himself so hard.\\n\\nHe’s got this stomach thing where it goes into paralysis and won’t digest the food sitting in this stomach and then when it starts pumping (?) again and drops all of the old food into his gut he gets really ill.  Apparently this happens with diabetes?  I have also, more than once, found him passed out on the floor of the employee room when he’s gone up for a shot.  When he gets sick and goes home I won’t hear from him for days and have to contact his sons to see if he’s dead.  I ask him about it after and he says he just comes to after days and has to look at a calendar to see how long he missed. \\n\\n1st sous chef has had this illness for 20 years.  He refuses to go to the doctor for regular treatment or even when he’s ill.  When I say “in the hospital” it’s because he gets so fucking sick that his kids call 911 (they’re all grown adults BTW).  He does take insulin, but that’s as far as any self treatment goes.  He smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish.  I know lots of other people with diabetes, my aunt for example has never ever had to go to the doctor for complications due to diabetes, neither did my friend in high school (and he was 17 and an idiot), and neither does my CURRENT prep cook, who ALSO has diabetes.  Because they take care of themselves! My prep cook brings himself little sugar free cookies and bananas to work with him and eats these cactus tortillas bc they have less sugar than corn. So it’s increasingly frustrating to deal with his constant sickness, not because of the inconvenience to me and the business, I solved that with 2nd sous chef, but because we’re all watching this dude kill himself in front of us and he’s the most stubborn mother fucker in the world and it’s breaking my heart.\\n\\nOk, so last Friday I’m up in my office doing some paperwork and go into the kitchen to check on things and 1st sous is gone, 2nd sous says he got really sick and left an hour earlier.  No big deal, we’re extra staffed with a new guy training so I’m not worried about it and leave at my normal time.  Saturday 1st sous is a no show, I text and call, but as usual hear nothing.  2nd Sous coincidentally lives with 1st, so I ask him if he’s okay and he says he hasn’t talked to him that he was asleep when he got home the night before and was still sleeping when he left for work in the morning.  My days off are Sun. and Mon. and 2nd sous is going out of town to visit his fam for Thanksgiving, so I assume I’m going to be working on both of my days off to cover for 1st sous.  C’est le vie, they’re super slow days so boring, but no biggie.\\n\\nTuesday comes and 1st sous comes in to talk to me.  We go outside and he tells me he found a diabetic ulcer on his foot and that it started to “stink” on Sunday.  He refuses to go the doctor bc he knows they’re going to tell him to amputate.  His plan is to cut off the dead tissue himself, apparently he’s done this before (…) and his friend gave him some weird oil shit that’s supposed to kill the infection before it can get into his blood stream (I forgot to mention, he says he is allergic to all antibiotics) I try and talk him out of it and tell him prosthesis have improved, he’ll be able to do everything he can now, no one will even be able to tell, but he won’t even consider it because HE WON’T STOP DRINKING AND SMOKING.  Like it’s his fucking life blood, I was like, what?!  You won’t stop smoking to have more time with your kids?   And he shrugged and said he’s raised 5 good men and they don’t need him.  Basically he wants me to give him two weeks to “get back to normal.”  In my opinion, he is not going to get back to normal.  He is going to ignore this until he gets blood poisoning and dies.  I told him that I think he shouldn’t waste what time he has left working and that he should spend it with his kids and he said, yeah maybe.\\n\\nThis situation has been really stressful in a lot of ways, I really care about him and I obviously don’t want him to fucking die and he was crying telling me and I was crying and it was all very awful.

Within a few weeks, her son proclaimed himself her co-ruler as King Charles I of Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in Netherlands and his affairs were mostly controlled by the Flemish noble William de Croÿ, sieur de Chièvres.  In 1517, the seventeen-year-old King sailed to Castile, where he was formally recognised as King of Castile.  There, his Flemish court provoked much scandal, as de Croÿ shamelessly sold government privileges for personal money and installed other Flemish nobles into government offices.  In May 1518, Charles traveled to Barcelona in Aragon, where he would remain for nearly two years. Here, he haggled with Aragon's slightly stronger cortes, the Generalitat, for privileges and his formal recognition as King of Aragon. Aragon managed to maintain more local control than Castile did, but mostly because Aragon was poorer and there was no point in pressing the issue for extra tax money that wasn't there to be collected. In 1519, the King's paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, died.  Charles competed with King Francis I of France to win the imperial election by aggressively bribing prince-electors.  Charles won, becoming Emperor Charles V. He left Aragon to return to Castile to raise funds to pay down the debts he had incurred in the election.  The taxes granted to Charles at a Castilian cortes in Corunna would help spark the Revolt of the Comuneros of Castile.  Of more importance for Aragon, in the summer of 1519 Charles granted his permission to the Germanies to arm themselves against the raiding Muslim fleets. While permission had previously been granted under Ferdinand, Charles was able to force the Valencian nobles to accept this decision.\\nAnswer this question: Where did Charles travel to first, Castile or Barcelona?","target":"Castile","rationale":"In order to figure out where Charles traveled first, we need read the passage carefully.

Ozone layer loss due to pollution only occurs where human activity exists, but it has not been proven how much each pollutant contributes yet.

And that's what he did.\\nVery early one terribly cold morning when the snow was deep on the ground, he packed a bag with some clothes, some chocolate and a map of Canada and set off to a forest.

The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian  (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.\\n\\n- Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta.

When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)  were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew.

It is considered an important symbol of the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of Latvia. Unveiled in 1935, the 42-metre (138 ft) high monument of granite, travertine, and copper often serves as the focal point of public gatherings and official ceremonies in Riga.\\nThe sculptures and bas-reliefs of the monument, arranged in thirteen groups, depict Latvian culture and history. The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other, decreasing in size towards the top, completed by a 19-metre (62 ft) high travertine column bearing the copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars. The concept for the monument first emerged in the early 1920s when the Latvian Prime Minister, Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics, ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a \\"memorial column\\". After several contests the monument was finally built at the beginning of the 1930s according to the scheme \\"Mirdzi kā zvaigzne!\\" (\\"Shine like a star!\\") submitted by Latvian sculptor Kārlis Zāle. Construction works were financed by private donations.\\nFollowing the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered it to be of high artistic value. In 1963, when the issue of demolition was raised again, it was dismissed by Soviet authorities as the destruction of the building would have caused deep indignation and tension in society.

Since then, Jesse has written a novel, This Time, inspired by his time with Celine, and the book has become an American bestseller. To help sales in Europe, Jesse does a book tour. The last stop of the tour is Paris, and Jesse is doing a reading at the bookstore Shakespeare and Company. As Jesse talks with his audience, flashbacks are shown of him and Celine in Vienna; the memories of their night together have clearly remained with him despite it being nine years later. Three journalists are present at the bookstore, interviewing Jesse: a romantic who is convinced the book's main characters meet again, a cynic who is convinced that they don't, and a third one who, despite wanting them to meet again, remains doubtful they actually do. They represent the three possible ways a viewer might guess what the aftermath of Before Sunrise might be, according to his or her own personality. Celine appears in the audience and sees him, and he, in turn, recognizes her. Jesse has a short time before his plane departs and invites Celine to share it with him.However, once the presentation is over, the bookstore manager reminds him he's got a plane to catch and must leave for the airport in a little more than an hour, and so just like in Before Sunrise, Celine and Jesse's reunion is constrained by time. Just like in the prequel, the characters are thus forced to make the best of what little time they have together, and this makes it easier for their conversations to become ever more personal, starting out with the usual thirty-something's themes of work and politics and then, with ever increasing passion, approaching their love for each other, just as their time together is running out.As they talk, each reveals what has happened since their first meeting.

From January 1979 through June 1985, 84 patients with tricuspid atresia and ventriculoarterial concordance underwent the modified Fontan/Kreutzer operation at the Mayo Clinic. Sixty patients had atriopulmonary connection and 24 patients had atrioventricular connections. Preoperative characteristics of the two patient groups were similar, but there was a greater frequency of Waterston shunts in the atriopulmonary group (38% versus 17%) and greater frequency of Glenn shunts in the atrioventricular group (46% versus 15%). Mean pulmonary arteriolar resistance was 1.9 +/- 0.7 units in the atriopulmonary group and 1.1 +/- 0.8 units in the atrioventricular group (p less than 0.01). Early postoperatively, mean right atrial pressure was slightly higher in the atriopulmonary group than in the atrioventricular group (18 +/- 3 versus 16 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), but this difference was not reflected in the early or late results. Operative mortality was 5% for patients with atriopulmonary connections and 4% for patients with atrioventricular connections. At 3.5 years postoperatively, the overall survival rate was 89% +/- 4% for patients with atriopulmonary connection and 88% +/- 7% for patients with atrioventricular connections. We conclude that there is no important difference in the clinical outcome of patients undergoing modified Fontan/Kreutzer repair for tricuspid atresia with atrioventricular concordance with either of the two operative methods. The choice of the connection should be dictated by the anatomy, such as presence of pulmonary valve or arterial stenoses, size of outlet chamber, and the presence of anomalous coronary arteries.","target":"Adolescence","rationale":"In the abstract, it says that tricuspid atresia is a congenital anomaly that occurs in 1 per 10,000 live births.

Fewer know him as an inventor with patents on file in Washington, but that’s what he claims in a commercial he’s airing as he seeks to defeat 2010 GOP nominee Charlotte Bergmann. The winner in Thursday’s Aug. 2 primary will face the winner of the primary between incumbent U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen and school board member Tomeka Hart. The commercial boldly claimsthat Flinn is \\"\\"a doctor whose patents in ultrasound have revolutionized modern medicine, whose innovations have saved lives throughout the world.\\"\\" Based on the scant evidence we were able to discover and our lack of deep knowledge in the history of ultrasound technology, we are narrowing the focus to whether Flinn does indeed hold patents in ultrasound technology that might have revolutionized modern medicine. The only Flinn patent we were able to find was awarded on July 3, 2007, and it is not for ultrasound technology. Flinn and two others received patent No. 7,238,370 B2 for their invention of a substance made of pumice and an aqueous surfactant (like a detergent) that experiments showed increased skin thickness and gave it a \\"\\"more youthful appearance.\\"\\" It was also tested on shaved guinea pigs. Its claim is that it prevents and treats \\"\\"photoaging\\"\\" of skin. Whatever the usefulness of this substance, we’re comfortable concluding it has not revolutionized modern medicine. It took Flinn’s campaign more than a week to provide information about other innovations the campaign believes backs up Flinn’s claims. OnThursday evening, July 26, campaign manager Kristi Stanley sent along three acknowledgement letters from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office confirming receipt of applications for patents. Not patents, but applications for patents. The letters state that the information Flinn provided (which was not provided to PolitiFact) \\"\\"will be examined for patentability.\\"\\" The letters also extend Flinn the right under federal law to seek a patent in foreign countries. Nothing that Stanley provided indicates Flinn sought foreign patents. She did note that Flinn also was involved in obtaining patents while employed by the National Institutes of Health that are held, not by him, but by that government agency. So let’s look at the three patent applications, according to the initial letters from the Patent and Trademark Office dated in May and June of this year. One (Customer No. 062439) is for \\"\\"Chemotherapy Treatment Using Microspheres to Deliver a High Concentration of a Drug to a Tumor.\\"\\" The letter provided by Stanley provides no other information about the patent itself, just details about Flinn’s rights. It does not appear to deal with ultrasound. The second is titled \\"\\"Process for an Improved Galactogram Procedure,\\"\\" with, again, no supporting description or detail. The third: \\"\\"Color Encoding Method for Ultrasound Images.\\"\\" Again: No detail. We could explain that galactography is the examination of the breast by mammography and, specifically, examination of the milk ducts, or that microspheres are particles smaller than one millimeter in diameter. But it seems we can make short work of this analysis by saying that, although Flinn claims to deserve the patent for them, these are not patented inventions and he only sought them after he was deeply involved in this congressional campaign. If the technologies are being employed in medicine to demonstrative salubrious effect, it isn’t because they are his patents because the patents have not yet been granted. When contacted initially, the campaign indicated it was eager for us to examine the claim but did not provide the kind of supportive documentation that would establish its veracity. Instead, the documentation establishes the application for patents. But Flinn’s commercials flatly claim he his patents in ultrasound technology revolutionized modern medicine, when the record shows he he only applied for patents several months after this congressional campaign was under way. That kind of deliberate deception of voters earns this claim a\\" Claim: \\"George Flinn Says his \\"\\"patents in ultrasound have revolutionized modern medicine.\\"","target":"0","rationale":"The paragraph starts by stating that Flinn made a commercial claiming that he is the inventor of patents in ultrasound technology. The paragraph then states that only one patent was found, which did not involve ultrasound technology at all. In fact, the paragraph goes on to say that Flinn's campaign manager provided three letters showing applications for patents, but they were only applications and no actual patents have been granted yet. Therefore, since there are no actual patented inventions and since the author claims they have not been used to revolutionize modern medicine at all, it can be concluded that this claim is false; hence, it should be classified as '0'."},{"source":"A screw will increase in temperature when set in the sun's path, why?\\n\\nA -> heating element\\n\\nB -> building device\\n\\nC -> conduction\\n\\nD -> convection\\n\\nIs the right answer A, B, C or D ?","target":"C","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"it is C because there are no convection currents in space\\"."},{"source":"Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly.

Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.\\n\\nBill and Jane are two farmers. They both had aphid infestation problems over the last few years, so Bill decided to use many types of insecticides in order to keep the aphids under control. He was only partially successful.

Throughout the film, the audience is gradually shown truths about Erika's private life. Behind her assured façade, she is a woman whose sexual repression verges into full-fledged desperation and is manifested in a long list of paraphilias, including (but by no means limited to) voyeurism and sadomasochistic fetishes such as sexual self-mutilation.Upon meeting Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel), a charming 17-year-old engineering student from a bourgeois background, they begin to obsess one another. Even though she initially attempts to prevent consistent contact and even tries to undermine his application to the conservatory, he eventually becomes her pupil. Like her, he appreciates and is a gifted (if distinct) interpreter of Schumann and Schubert.She destroys the musical prospects of an insecure but talented girl, Anna Schober, driven by her jealousy of the girl's contact with Walter -- and also, perhaps, by her fears that Anna's life will mirror her own.

In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The populations of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities \\"showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect.\\" Subsequent studies carried out by Feder et al. confirmed the large portion of non-local maternal origin among Ashkenazi Jews. Reflecting on their findings related to the maternal origin of Ashkenazi Jews, the authors conclude \\"Clearly, the differences between Jews and non-Jews are far larger than those observed among the Jewish communities.

Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum.\\n\\n- A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\\n\\n- In mathematics , a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements . For example , the sequence \\\\ langle A , B , D \\\\ rangle is a subsequence of \\\\ langle A , B , C , D , E , F \\\\ rangle obtained after removal of elements C , E , and F. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a preorder . The subsequence should not be confused with substring \\\\ langle A , B , C , D \\\\ rangle which can be derived from the above string \\\\ langle A , B , C , D , E , F \\\\ rangle by deleting substring \\\\ langle E , F \\\\ rangle . The substring is a refinement of the subsequence .\\n\\n- In mathematics, especially in order theory, a preorder or quasiorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive. Preorders are more general than equivalence relations and (non-strict) partial orders, both of which are special cases of a preorder.\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is at the same time a reflexive relation, a symmetric relation and a transitive relation. As a consequence of these properties an equivalence relation provides a partition of a set into equivalence classes.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed. Like a set, it contains members (also called \\"elements\\", or \\"terms\\"). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the \\"length\\" of the sequence. Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first \\"n\\" natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length \\"n\\"). The position of an element in a sequence is its \\"rank\\" or \\"index\\"; it is the integer from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or of a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1. When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the \\"n\\"th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with \\"n\\" as subscript; for example, the \\"n\\"th element of the Fibonacci sequence is generally denoted \\"F\\".\\n\\n- In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in \\"there are \\"six\\" coins on the table\\") and ordering (as in \\"this is the \\"third\\" largest city in the country\\"). In common language, words used for counting are \\"cardinal numbers\\" and words used for ordering are \\"ordinal numbers\\".\\n\\n- Order theory is a branch of mathematics which investigates the intuitive notion of order using binary relations. It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as \\"this is less than that\\" or \\"this precedes that\\". This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions. A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the order theory glossary.\\n\\n- Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a binary relation on a set \\"A\\" is a collection of ordered pairs of elements of \\"A\\". In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product \\"A\\" = . More generally, a binary relation between two sets \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" is a subset of .

A linear accelerometer was affixed to the lever arm. Speed settings were standardized percentages of each machine's maximum tachometer feedback voltage (0 to 100% Vfb max). Regression of Cybex transducer-observed voltages (V0) on true, i.e., expected, torques (Me) revealed that, for any static loading condition or angle, the measurement system was essentially linear and valid, although greater variance was evident for smaller torques. However, different calibrations, i.e., regression lines, were required for different speed settings. The error in predicting Me from V0 increased substantially with increased % Vfb max. Methodologies which assume constant velocity dynamic loading induce questionable, often invalid, results and inferences. Dynamic V0 represents both gravitational and inertial components. Considerable fluctuations in lever arm instantaneous velocity were ascribed to the combined influence of load and % Vfb max upon the servomotor. After computing inertia-corrected Me, calibration variability and prediction error were markedly reduced. Unexplained variability may be due to poor proximity of the Cybex transducer to the force application point. We concluded that: Cybex II should be calibrated only statically; use of an optimal filter will avoid false estimates of joint torque; inertial corrections must be applied in order to minimize potentially serious errors due to system angular acceleration; and reported muscle function relationships might be usefully re-assessed in view of these findings. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides numerical values for torque and speed, as well as results from regression analyses performed to estimate torques from observed voltages.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement.

The group broke up in early 1975, and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri. \\nIn its first era, the band's musical style drew on the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Byrds. Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \\"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations,\\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \\"quintessential American power pop band,\\" and \\"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\\".Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records, and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. \\nAfter a third album, recorded in the fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success, but has since become a cult classic. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27.\\nDuring the group's hiatus in the 1980s, the Big Star discography drew renewed attention when R.E.M. and the Replacements, as well as other popular bands, cited the group as an influence.

In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.

These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred preferentially to appearance, not heredity, and appearance is a poor indication of ancestry, because only a few genes are responsible for someone's skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be also true about European ancestry. The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil reflects the extent of miscegenation in Brazilian society, a society that remains highly, but not strictly, stratified along color lines. These socioeconomic factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines, because a minority of pardos, or brown people, are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward, and being seen as relatively \\"whiter\\" as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions of Latin America).\\nWhat is the answer to this question: What is appearance a poor indication of?","target":"ancestry","rationale":"The context states that race refers preferentially to appearance.

The conviction resulted in the suspension of Monk's cabaret card, the permit required by performers in New York for work in nightclubs. Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s. Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, led an appeal on the pianist's behalf in front of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to have his card restored. Colomby argued to the SLA that Monk was \\"a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician\\".In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, prompting Colomby to consider the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. \\"I wanted to find a place that was small\\", he later said. \\"I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out.\\" Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in the reinstatement of his cabaret card and his employment at the Five Spot Café. In his first stable job in years, Monk helped transform the small bar into one of the city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of the pianist's music.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\".\\n\\nParagraph: Some single-stranded positive-sense RNA [ssRNA(+)] viruses, including Flavivirus, generate specific organelle-like structures in the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These structures are called virus replication organelles and consist of two distinct subdomains, the vesicle packets (VPs) and the convoluted membranes (CMs). The VPs are clusters of small vesicle compartments and are considered to be the site of viral genome replication. The CMs are electron-dense amorphous structures observed in proximity to the VPs, but the exact roles of CMs are mostly unknown. Several recent studies have revealed that flaviviruses recruit several host factors that are usually used for the biogenesis of other conventional organelles and usurp their function to generate virus replication organelles. In the current review, we summarize recent studies focusing on the role of host factors in the formation of virus replication organelles and discuss how these intricate membrane structures are organized. \\n Title: Molecular Sciences Review Flavivirus Replication Organelle Biogenesis in the Endoplasmic Reticulum: Comparison with Other Single-Stranded Positive-Sense RNA Viruses","target":"False","rationale":"The given title is: \\"Molecular Sciences Review Flavivirus Replication Organelle Biogenesis in the Endoplasmic Reticulum: Comparison with Other Single-Stranded Positive-Sense RNA Viruses\\".

Entering dictionaries after World War II, the word \\"motel\\", coined as a portmanteau contraction of \\"motor hotel\\", originates from the Milestone Mo-Tel of San Luis Obispo, California (now called the Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo), which was built in 1925. The term referred initially to a type of hotel consisting of a single building of connected rooms whose doors faced a parking lot and in some circumstances, a common area or a series of small cabins with common parking. Motels are often individually owned, though motel chains do exist.\\n\\n- Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. \\n\\n- Supernatural fiction or supernaturalist fiction is a genre of literary and media fiction exploiting or requiring as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace natural world and materialist assumptions about it. \\n\\n- Stephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author of horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, science fiction, and fantasy. His books have sold more than 350 million copies, many of which have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, television shows, and comic books. King has published 54 novels, including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman, and six non-fiction books. He has written nearly 200 short stories, most of which have been collected in book collections. Many of his stories are set in his home state of Maine. His novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" was the basis for the movie \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" which is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.\\n\\n- A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images.\\n\\n- \`\` 1408 '' is a short story by Stephen King .

In the introduction to the story , King says that \`\` 1408 '' is his version of what he calls the \`\` Ghostly Room at the Inn '' , his term for the theme of haunted hotel or motel rooms in horror fiction . He originally wrote the first few pages as part of an appendix for his non-fiction book , On Writing ( 2000 ) , to be used as an example of how a story changes from one draft document to the next . King also noted how the numbers of the title add up to the supposedly unlucky number 13 .\\n\\n- The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.\\n\\n- Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") \\n\\n- A metaphor is a figure of speech that refers, for rhetorical effect, to one thing by mentioning another thing. It may provide clarity or identify hidden similarities between two ideas. Where a simile compares two items, a metaphor directly equates them, and does not use \\"like\\" or \\"as\\" as does a simile. One of the most commonly cited examples of a metaphor in English literature is the \\"All the world's a stage\\" monologue from \\"As You Like It\\":\\n\\n- The distinction between horror and terror is a standard literary and psychological concept applied especially to Gothic literature and film. Terror is usually described as the feeling of dread and anticipation that \\"precedes\\" the horrifying experience. By contrast, horror is the feeling of revulsion that usually occurs \\"after\\" something frightening is seen, heard, or otherwise experienced. It is the feeling one gets after coming to an awful realization or experiencing a deeply unpleasant occurrence. In other words, horror is more related to being shocked or scared (being horrified), while terror is more related to being anxious or fearful. Horror has also been defined as a combination of terror and revulsion.\\n\\n- On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft is a memoir by American author Stephen King, that documents his experiences as a writer and relays his advice for aspiring writers. First published in 2000 by Charles Scribner's Sons, \\"On Writing\\" is King's first book after the car accident a year earlier. In 2010, Scribner republished the memoir as a 10th anniversary edition, which featured an updated reading list from King.\\n\\n- Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \\"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society.\\n\\n- Good faith, in human interactions, is a sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction. While some Latin phrases lose their literal meaning over centuries, this is not the case with \\"bona fides\\"; it is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern day translation of \\"good faith\\". It is an important concept within law, philosophy, and business. The opposed concepts are bad faith, \\"mala fides\\" (duplicity) and perfidy (pretense). In contemporary English, the usage of \\"bona fides\\" (note the \\"s\\") is synonymous with credentials and identity. The phrase is sometimes used in job advertisements, and should not be confused with the \\"bona fide\\" occupational qualifications or the employer's good faith effort, as described below.\\n\\n- A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. In the West, a modern residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, counters and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher and other electric appliances. The main function of a kitchen is serving as a location for storing, cooking and preparing food (and doing related tasks such as dishwashing), but it may also be used for dining, entertaining and laundry.\\n\\n- Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption is a novella by Stephen King, from his 1982 collection \\"Different Seasons\\", subtitled \\"Hope Springs Eternal\\". It is loosely based on Leo Tolstoy short story God Sees the Truth, But Waits. It was adapted for the screen in 1994 as \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", which was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994, including Best Picture. In 2009, it was adapted for the stage as the play \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\".\\n\\n- A portmanteau (; plural \\"portmanteaus\\" or \\"portmanteaux\\" ) or portmanteau word is a linguistic blend of words, in which parts of multiple words or their phones (sounds) are combined into a new word. \\nas in \\"smog\\", coined by blending \\"smoke\\" and \\"fog\\", or \\"popportunity\\", from \\"popping\\" and \\"opportunity\\", or \\"motel\\", from \\"motor\\" and \\"hotel\\". In linguistics, a portmanteau is defined as a single morph that represents two or more morphemes.\\n\\n- A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.\\n\\n- Richard Bachman is a pen name used by horror fiction author Stephen King.\\n\\n- Blood and Smoke (1999) is an audiobook where Stephen King reads three of his own short stories. At the time, he said that the two short stories which had not been published wouldn't be, however, all three were published in the \\"Everything's Eventual\\" collection.\\n\\n- An abridgement (or abridgment) is a condensing or reduction of a book or other creative work into a shorter form while maintaining the unity of the source. The abridgement can be true to the original work in terms of mood and tone, capturing the parts the abridging author perceives to be most important; it could be a complete parody of the original; or it could fall anywhere in-between, either generally capturing the tone and message of the original author but falling short in some manner, or subtly twisting their words and message to favor a different interpretation or agenda. Compare/contrast with epitome.\\n\\n- Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.\\n\\n- An audiobook (or talking book) is a recording of a text being read. A reading of the complete text is noted as \\"unabridged\\", while readings of a reduced version, or abridgement of the text are labeled as \\"abridged\\".\\n\\n- A memoir (from French: \\"mémoire\\": \\"memoria\\", meaning \\"memory\\" or \\"reminiscence\\") is a collection of memories that an individual writes about moments or events, both public or private, that took place in the subject's life. The assertions made in the work are understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story \\"of a life\\", while a memoir often tells \\"a story from a life\\", such as touchstone events and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a \\"memoirist\\" or a \\"memorialist\\".\\n\\n- A restaurant (or ), or an eatery, is a business which prepares and serves food and drinks to customers in exchange for money. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services, and some only offer take-out and delivery. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments. \\n\\n- The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\", the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \\"Red\\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation.\\n\\n- John Anthony Bowden Cuddon (2 June 1928  12 March 1996), was an English author, dictionary writer, and school teacher. He is known best for his \\"Dictionary of Literary Terms\\" (published in several editions), described by the Times Educational Supplement as scholarly, succinct, comprehensive and entertainingan indispensable work of reference. Cuddon also wrote \\"The Macmillan Dictionary of Sport and Games\\", a two million-word account of most of the worlds sports and games through history, as well as several novels, plays, travel books, and other published works.

The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates.

In the novel Cronin advocated a free public health service in order to defeat the wiles of those doctors who \\"raised guinea-snatching and the bamboozling of patients to an art form.\\" Dr Cronin and Aneurin Bevan had both worked at the Tredegar Cottage Hospital in Wales, which served as one of the bases for the NHS. The author quickly made enemies in the medical profession, and there was a concerted effort by one group of specialists to get The Citadel banned. Cronin's novel, which was the highest-selling book ever published by Victor Gollancz, informed the public about corruption within the medical system, planting a seed that eventually led to reform. Not only were the author's pioneering ideas instrumental in the creation of the NHS, but the historian Raphael Samuel asserted in 1995 that the popularity of Cronin's novels played a substantial role in the Labour Party's landslide victory in 1945.  By contrast, according to one of Cronin's biographers, Alan Davies, the book's reception was mixed. A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to one of its many messages: that a few well-heeled doctors in fashionable practices were ripping off their equally well-off patients. Some pointed to the lack of balance between criticism and praise for hard-working doctors. The majority accepted it for what it was, a topical novel. The press attempted to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy, while Victor Gollancz followed suit in an attempt to promote the book, all overlooking the fact that it was a work of fiction, not a scientific piece of research, and not autobiographical.  In the United States The Citadel won the National Book Award, Favorite Fiction of 1937, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 1939, The Citadel was voted the most interesting book readers had ever read.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Is there anything else interesting about the citadel?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"helped to incite the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom","rationale":"The context mentions the book The Citadel, which helped to incite the establishment of NHS in UK by exposing corruption within medical practice.\\nAccordingly, \\"helped to incite the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom\\" is another interesting aspect about this novel"},{"source":"Choose between \\"gravel\\" and  \\"sidewalk\\".\\nQuestion: Kim is pushing her baby in the stroller.

Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \\"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down\\".

My parents often threaten to kick me out because I don’t often conform to their rules (since they have always been controlling, I sometimes rebel against them when I feel like they’re being unfair) so my anxiety is through the roof at that point. (side note: I hadn’t brought up any problems with my parents since we got back together).  My ex and I had plans to see each other but before we meet up I tell him what had just happened between my parents and I. He picks me up and he seems a little distant (not looking at me, straight faced, not talking or smiling), it may have been my anxiety but I start feeling like he doesn’t want to be around me because of my negative situation. So I tell him how I felt in that moment “I feel like you’re being distant because you don’t want to deal with my problems right now.” I probably could have worded it better but he immediately started getting defensive and said “It’s just like the same shit as before”. He starts yelling at me saying that I don’t appreciate anything he does, that just because i’m going through stuff at home doesn’t mean I should take it out on him, that i’m this way because of my parents. I’m sobbing at this point and I tell him he took what I said the wrong way, that I’m just upset about my home life, and apologize, but he’s angry now. I start having a panic attack because I feel like everyone I love is going against me/ doesn’t accept me. He says he blew off all his other plans to “be there for me” so i tell him to take me home.

After some time, she asked him to take her home because she felt everyone around them was against them or did not accept them.\\\\nThe above description indicates that this anecdote is referring to a past event where the author's relationship with their current/ex-boyfriend became strained due to misunderstandings between the two of them regarding each other's actions during an emotional exchange about family problems each of them were facing at home (the author's parents are controlling and critical of their behavior; his parents are very loving, understanding, and accepting).\\\\nBased on these observations, it seems likely that this anecdote is meant as a reflection on events in which both parties were acting out due to stressors related to family obligations or conflicts with one another rather than as consideration for future action by either party regarding how they might handle similar situations in the future (where one party might feel emotionally unsupported by another).

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states:\\n“Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.”\\nYet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...\\nQuestion: What does competition between providers cause?\\nAnswer:","target":"Great choice of more innovative and better quality products","rationale":"The context mentions that the government believes competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. \\nSo the answer is Great choice of more innovative and better quality products."},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nParagraph :\\n\\nThe bigger the waves are and the more sediment they carry, the more erosion they cause.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nWhen there are a lot of waves things are eroded faster or slower?","target":"faster","rationale":"Bigger waves carry more sediment and do more damage, so they cause faster erosion.\\n*/"},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Ben warned to leave Toby Tyler alone?\\n\\nAfter his stern Uncle Daniel describes him as a \\"millstone\\" for neglecting his chores, ten year old Toby Tyler runs away from his foster home to join the circus.

With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River.

The resulting ions are held together by strong attractions between oppositely charged particles. However, this only works for bonds between atoms in which one partner (the metal) has a tendency to lose electrons, and the other (the nonmetal) has a tendency to gain them. Then how might two nonmetals, such as nitrogen and oxygen, form chemical bonds? Neither is likely to lose electrons and become a cation, but both require more electrons to reach a noble gas configuration. Instead of a complete transfer of electrons, these atoms can bond by sharing electrons, producing what is called a covalent bond . When a group of atoms are joined together by covalent bonds, the resulting structure is called a molecule . Molecules are generally much smaller than the extended three-dimensional networks of ions that are seen in ionic compounds.

Passage:Despite this, Farr was discharged from hospital and sent back to the front with the 1st Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, a part of the 6th Infantry Division, with which he fought in the Battle of the Somme. Farr reported himself to the medical station several times over the following months. In April 1916, he was kept at the medical station for a fortnight due to his state. On 22 July 1916 he spent the night at a medical station and was discharged for duty the following morning. On 17 September 1916 he again attempted to seek the help of a medical orderly, but was refused as he was not physically wounded and the aid station was dealing with a high number of battle casualties. Farr reported for duty at the transport lines at 8 P.M. that evening, but went missing shortly afterwards. Upon being found at 11 P.M., he refused to return to the front line. He was subsequently arrested for disobeying orders, and on 1 October 1916 tried by court martial at Ville-sur-Ancre. He had to defend himself against the formal accusation of 'misbehaving before the enemy in such a manner as to show cowardice'. The Divisional court martial, presided over by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Spring, the Commanding Officer of the 11th (Service) Battalion of the Essex Regiment, lasted 20 minutes, and questions have subsequently been raised about its competence. The hearing found Farr guilty and sentenced him to death. General Sir Douglas Haig, as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force subsequently confirmed the execution order, and Farr was shot by a firing squad made up from men of his own regiment at 6.00 A.M. on 18 October 1916, near Carnoy on the Somme.

Pituitary glands from both sexes at different ages were monodispersed with 0.1% trypsin. Freshly dispersed cells were incubated in Cunningham chambers for measurement of the fraction of plaque-forming cells and the size of plaques formed, or attached to glass slides for measurement of the fraction of cells staining for PRL by ICC. The percentage of plaque-forming cells in both sexes gradually increased with age from about 5% of the total anterior pituitary cell population at 5 days of age to the adult levels of about 54% in the females at proestrus and about 37% in the males. Sexual differences in the percentage of plaque-forming cells were consistently seen at 40 days of age and thereafter. The mean size of plaques in both sexes also increased with age from about 1,100 microns 2 at 5 days of age to a peak level of about 15,600 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 6,700 microns 2 in the males at 60 days of age; then fell to the adult levels of about 5,500 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 3,200 microns 2 in males. Sexual differences first appeared at 40 days of age and were estrogen-dependent. The results from ICC closely matched those from the plaque assay, except at 5 days of age and in the adult males. At 5 days, the fraction of cells staining for PRL was twice that of cells forming plaques. In adult male rats there were about 47% immunostained PRL cells but only about 39% plaque-forming cells. This difference, however, disappeared after estrogen treatment. These results demonstrate that sexual differences in the lactotrope population develop around puberty in rats and appear to be estrogen dependent.","target":"Postnatal development of pituitary lactotropes in the rat measured by reverse hemolytic plaque assay","rationale":"The article describes the postnatal development of pituitary lactotropes in rats, which was assessed by measuring PRL levels using a reverse hemolytic plaque assay.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Pam is an astronaut who has been given a mission to find a new planet for humans to live on.
