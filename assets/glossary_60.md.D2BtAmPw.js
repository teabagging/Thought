Thomas Price's Independent Rifle Company, one of the original ten independent companies of riflemen from the frontier regions of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia authorized by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. He received his commission dated January 1, 1776, as a third lieutenant while serving at the Siege of Boston. In June 1776 Tannehill and his company were incorporated into the newly organized Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, at which time he advanced to second lieutenant. Later that year a large portion of his regiment was captured or killed at the Battle of Fort Washington on northern Manhattan Island. However, those members of the unit not taken in the battle, including Tannehill, continued to serve actively with Washington's Main Army, participating in the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, and in the spring of 1777 were administratively attached to the 11th Virginia Regiment. Tannehill was promoted to first lieutenant on May 18, 1777, and the following month he was attached to the newly organized Provisional Rifle Corps commanded by Col. Daniel Morgan, which played a major role in the Battles of Saratoga and a peripheral role in the Battle of Monmouth. He returned to the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment (his permanent unit) in mid-1778 when Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings, the regiment's commander who had been exchanged from British captivity earlier that year, was marshaling the remnants of his unit and recruiting new members while stationed at Fort Frederick, Maryland. In early 1779 Tannehill and the regiment were assigned to Fort Pitt of present-day western Pennsylvania where they supplemented other Continental forces engaged in the defense of frontier settlements from Indian raids. Tannehill advanced to the rank of captain on July 29, 1779, and he commanded the regiment in late 1780. He was discharged from service on January 1, 1781, when his unit was disbanded.\\n Passage 2:Friends dissolved shortly afterwards, and Kipner formed a new group, Skyband. Lloyd and Cotton left MGM when Curb also left to establish his own production company. The pair recruited Texan-born Chris Christian, and in 1975 the trio recorded their first album, Cotton, Lloyd & Christian, issued by 20th Century Records. Their version of the Del Shannon song \\"I Go to Pieces\\" - a 1965 hit for Peter and Gordon - became a #66 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Other tracks included a slowed-down version of the Supremes' hit \\"Baby Love\\"; a medley of songs from the Who's Tommy; and \\"I Don't Know Why You Love Me\\". The album was repackaged by Curb and Lloyd in 1976, and used as the music soundtrack of a movie, The Pom Pom Girls. The trio's second album, Number Two, also appeared in 1976, and in April 1977 they released another single, \\"Crying in the Rain\\", written by Carole King and Howie Greenfield and first recorded by the Everly Brothers. Both albums were produced by Lloyd and Curb. No further recordings by the trio were released.\\n Passage 3:Arieli was born in Ashkelon in 1959, the seventh and youngest son of parents from Iran. Arieli played in different teams in the handball Premier League. In 1978, he enlisted in the IDF, volunteered for the paratroopers, and was accepted into the brigade's \\"Orev\\" company, where he underwent a training course as a combat soldier, a course for infantry commanders and a course for infantry officers. At the end of the course he returned to the company as a platoon commander. He continued to serve in the brigade's commanding positions, among others as a company commander during the First Lebanon War, where he was also wounded, as commander of the paratroopers' \\"Orev\\" company, commander of a battalion at the paratroopers regiment's commander's course, commander of the paratroop brigade training base and deputy brigade commander. Arieli took part in a course for brigade commanders as commander of the northern brigade in Gaza, with the rank of colonel. Served as Deputy Military Secretary to the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense (1997-1999), and headed the Administration for the Interim Agreement in the West Bank and as Head of the Administration for the Permanent Status Agreement. In 2001, he retired from the IDF.","target":"3","rationale":"The question asks who was older, the Prime Minister or the Minister of Defense. In passage 3, it states that \\"Arieli served as Deputy Military Secretary to the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense\\". The question is about Arieli's bosses. If it says who was older between Arieli's boss and his boss' boss, then we can infer/conclude from passage 3 that the Prime Minister was older than the minister of defense because in 1999 he became deputy military secretary to both persons at once."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a sentence and question which can be answered using the sentence.

Passage:Mitchell was born in London, and educated at Brightlands Preparatory School and Dulwich College, London. In 1943 he registered as a conscientious objector and his war-time service was spent in the Non-Combatant Corps. After the war, he taught at Oakfield Preparatory School, London and in 1947 founded and edited the journal Music Survey; several issues appeared before he was joined in 1949 by Hans Keller and the journal was re-launched in the Music Survey's so-called 'New Series' (1949–52), whose uncompromising critical standards and pugnaciously pro-Britten and pro-Schoenberg stance brought it renown and notoriety in equal measure. Mitchell studied at Durham University 1949-50. In the 1950s he was a regular contributor to the journals Musical Times and Musical Opinion. In 1958 he became editor of Music Books at Faber and Faber and in the same year was appointed Editor of Boosey & Hawkes's music journal Tempo, until 1962. From 1963 to 1964 he was a special music adviser at Boosey & Hawkes with particular responsibility for contemporary music and the acquisition of contemporary composers. He was responsible for Peter Maxwell Davies and Nicholas Maw joining the publisher's list. In 1965, with the encouragement of Benjamin Britten he founded the music-publishing firm of Faber Music, and was its first Managing Director (vice-chairman, 1976, chairman, 1977, president, 1988–95). In 1972 he became the first Professor of Music at Sussex University (until 1976). Following the death of Benjamin Britten, Mitchell became a senior trustee of the Britten-Pears Foundation; in 1986 he became the Foundation's director and chairman of the Britten Estate Ltd.

DeBartolo Corporation formed a joint venture with Homart Development Company, a shopping mall development subsidiary of the department store chain Sears, to begin development on Castleton Square in 1971. DeBartolo announced the mall's development in January of that year and began groundbreaking soon afterward. The original plans called for a Y-shaped enclosed mall with three anchor stores: Sears, J. C. Penney, and Rike Kumler Co. (Rike's), a department store chain based out of Dayton, Ohio. The mall would be situated on 82nd Street just outside the Interstate 465 beltway within the Castleton neighborhood on the northeastern side of Indianapolis. It was the second of three malls built by DeBartolo as a part of its expansion into Indianapolis, following Lafayette Square Mall in 1968 and preceding Washington Square Mall in 1974. The company chose to build on the northeastern side of the Indianapolis metropolitan area, as the area was projected for further suburban growth in the intervening years. Similarly, research conducted by Sears showed a trend in residential growth to the city's northeast side, thus creating a market which the chain deemed suitable for a new store. To accommodate for mall traffic, the Indiana Department of Transportation expanded 82nd Street to a four-lane divided highway. Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.), then-owners of the Rike's chain, confirmed that the third anchor of Castleton Square would instead be Lazarus, a Columbus, Ohio-based chain then also under their ownership. Also confirmed as tenants for the mall by 1972 were a Kroger supermarket, an F. W. Woolworth Company dime store, and a three-screen movie theater. Inline tenants would include Robert Hall Clothes, Hickory Farms, Kinney Shoes, Zales Jewelers, Waldenbooks, and Orange Julius.\\n Links: a. Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. b.

He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.\\n\\n- A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).\\n\\n- Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period.\\n\\n- The Prior Analytics is Aristotle's work on deductive reasoning, which is known as his syllogistic. Being one of the six extant Aristotelian writings on logic and scientific method, it is part of what later Peripatetics called the \\"Organon\\". Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Jan Lukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The Jan Lukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s in a series of papers by John Corcoran and Timothy Smileywhich inform modern translations of \\"Prior Analytics\\" by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009.\\n\\n- Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.\\n\\n- The 6th century BC started the first day of 600 BC and ended the last day of 501 BC.\\n\\n- Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. 200 AD) was a Peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the Ancient Greek commentators on the writings of Aristotle. He was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria, and lived and taught in Athens at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the Peripatetic school. He wrote many commentaries on the works of Aristotle, extant are those on the \\"Prior Analytics\\", \\"Topics\\", \\"Meteorology\\", \\"Sense and Sensibilia\\", and \\"Metaphysics\\". Several original treatises also survive, and include a work \\"On Fate\\", in which he argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity; and one \\"On the Soul\\". His commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, \\"the commentator\\".\\n\\n- Sosigenes the Peripatetic ( Greek :  ) was a philosopher living at the end of the 2nd century AD . He was the tutor of Alexander of Aphrodisias and wrote a work On Revolving Spheres , from which some important extracts have been preserved in Simplicius 's commentary on Aristotle 's De Caelo . He criticized both Aristotle and Eudoxus for their imperfect theory of celestial spheres and also the use of epicycles , which he felt to be inconsistent with Aristotle 's philosophical postulates . He pointed out that the planets varied markedly in brightness , and that eclipses of the sun are sometimes total and sometimes annular , suggesting that the distances between the sun , moon and earth were not the same at different eclipses . Sosigenes is perhaps called \`\` the Peripatetic '' only because of his connection with Alexander . Some ancient evidence may be taken to suggest that he was , in fact , a Stoic . As John Patrick Lynch has written : The other two teachers of Alexander may actually have been the philosophers whom ancient sources called Stoics ; in both cases , Herminos / Sosigenes \`\` the Stoic '' have been distinguished from Herminos / Sosigenes \`\` the Peripatetic '' only on the grounds that the two latter men were teachers of Alexander of Aphrodisias . But it is not improbable that Alexander of Aphrodisias studied with two Stoic teachers and that these two pairs of homonymous contemporaries are actually only two Stoic philosophers . He is often confused with the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria , who advised Julius Caesar on the reform of the Roman calendar .\\n\\n- Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'sosigenes the peripatetic' and '200'?","target":"floruit","rationale":"The floruit (\\"fl.\\") or \\"f.\\" in the context of a person's lifespan dates is Latin for \\"[he, she] flourished\\", denoting roughly when they were living or active.

After exclusion of 39 patients with early deaths (19 dead on arrival, nine died in emergency room, and 11 died in operating room), the 196 remaining patients were treated in accordance with an evolving selective management program. Definitive management included splenectomy in 117 patients (59.7%), repair in 32 (16.3%), and nonoperative treatment in 47 (24%). A spectrum of blunt splenic trauma, as manifested by the degree of associated injuries (Injury Severity Scores), hemodynamic status, and blood transfusion requirements, was identified and permitted application of a rational selective management program that proved safe and effective for all age groups. Comparative analysis of the three methods of treatment demonstrated differences that were more a reflection of the overall magnitude of total bodily injury sustained rather than the specific manner in which any injured spleen was managed. Retrospective analysis of 19 nonoperative management failures enabled establishment of the following selection criteria for nonoperative management: absolute hemodynamic stability; minimal or lack of peritoneal findings; and maximal transfusion requirement of 2 units for the splenic injury. With operative management, splenorrhaphy is preferred, but it was often precluded by associated life-threatening injuries or by technical limitations. Of 42 attempted splenic repairs, ten (24%) were abandoned intraoperatively. There were no late failures of repair. In many cases of blunt splenic trauma, splenectomy still remains the most appropriate course of action. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes several numerical values: the number of patients treated during a recent 8-year period, the number of patients who received each type of treatment, specific Injury Severity Scores for each patient, and the maximum transfusion requirement for nonoperative management.

He was the second of four children of Matilde Andrades (July 28, 1934 - November 17, 2008) and Gerard Basquiat (1930 - July 7, 2013). He had two younger sisters: Lisane, born in 1964, and Jeanine, born in 1967. His father, Gerard Basquiat, was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and his mother, Matilde Basquiat, who was of Puerto Rican descent, was born in Brooklyn, New York.\\n\\n\\"Basquiat's canon revolves around single heroic figures: athletes, prophets, warriors, cops, musicians, kings and the artist himself. In these images the head is often a central focus, topped by crowns, hats, and halos. In this way the intellect is emphasized, lifted up to notice, privileged over the body and the physicality of these figures (i.e. black men) commonly represent in the world.\\"  Fred Hoffman hypothesizes that underlying Basquiat's sense of himself as an artist was his \\"innate capacity to function as something like an oracle, distilling his perceptions of the outside world down to their essence and, in turn, projecting them outward through his creative acts.\\" Additionally, continuing his activities as a graffiti artist, Basquiat often incorporated words into his paintings. Before his career as a painter began, he produced punk-inspired postcards for sale on the street, and became known for the political-poetical graffiti under the name of SAMO. On one occasion Basquiat painted his girlfriend's dress with the words \\"Little Shit Brown\\". He would often draw on random objects and surfaces, including other people's property. The conjunction of various media is an integral element of Basquiat's art. His paintings are typically covered with text and codes of all kinds: words, letters, numerals, pictograms, logos, map symbols, diagrams and more.  A middle period from late 1982 to 1985 featured multi-panel paintings and individual canvases with exposed stretcher bars, the surface dense with writing, collage and imagery. The years 1984-85 were also the main period of the Basquiat-Warhol collaborations, even if, in general, they were not very well received by the critics.  A major reference source used by Basquiat throughout his career was the book Gray's Anatomy, which his mother had given him while he was in the hospital at age seven. It remained influential in his depictions of internal human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text. Other major sources were Henry Dreyfuss' Symbol Sourcebook, Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, and Brentjes' African Rock Art.  Basquiat doodled often and some of his later pieces exhibited this; they were often colored pencil on paper with a loose, spontaneous, and dirty style much like his paintings. His work across all mediums displays a childlike fascination with the process of creating.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Jean-Michel Basquiat","rationale":"The text describes the life and career of Jean-Michel Basquiat.

Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), starting on 13 August 1961, the Wall completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989. Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in 1992. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the \\"death strip\\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, \\"fakir beds\\" and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc claimed that the Wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the \\"will of the people\\" in building a socialist state in East Germany.

It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, aided by captured German missile technology and personnel from the Aggregat program. \\nThe technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority.

The genes encoding the proteins that constitute the C3-activating enzymes have been cloned and mapped to a \\"complement activation\\" locus in the major histocompatibility complex, and we demonstrate in this study such a locus on the long arm of chromosome 1 at band 1q32. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adult 2)Ataxia Telangiectasia 3)Case Report","target":"No","rationale":"Since the abstract is about the alternative or classical pathways for complement system component C3 and its activation by microorganisms and antigen-antibody complexes, none of these mesh terms are appropriate descriptors.

The offenses struggled in the first quarter, and the first points would actually come via special teams in the second quarter, when Ted Ginn Jr. returned a punt 87 yards to paydirt for Miami. Later in the quarter, McNabb, who had already thrown two interceptions, was hit as he threw, spraining his ankle. David Akers came on to make a 34-yard field goal, and McNabb left the game. A. J. Feeley was spun up to play quarterback, but threw an interception of his own on his first drive. In the third quarter, Correll Buckhalter took the ball in from eight yards out for the go-ahead touchdown, making it 10-7. Feeley, after some helpful runs from running back Brian Westbrook, connected with receiver Jason Avant to increase the lead. The defense played a strong second half, and Westbrook carried seven times on the final drive, which killed the final 6:40 of the game. Without McNabb, Andy Reid leaned hard on Westbrook, who shattered his career-high with 32 carries, while picking up 148 yards. McNabb's post-game x-rays were negative.

Chatwin told Grieve to use the book for his film and make it his own . On the Black Hill begins in the closing years of the 19th century with the marriage of dour , puritanical Welsh farmer Amos Jones ( Bob Peck ) to his social superior , vicar 's daughter Mary Latimer ( Gemma Jones ) after the death of her father ( Mark Dignam ) . Her inheritance and social connections enable them to rent a vacant farm , ' The Vision ' , a situation that is a cause for resentment in their relationship . It is against this background , along with a boundary feud with Watkins , a malicious neighbour , that the twins Lewis ( Robert Gwilym ) and Benjamin ( Mike Gwilym ) grow up . Having come through wars , romance and separation , they are still farming at ' The Vision ' eighty years later . Bob Peck as the gaunt , wild - eyed Amos Jones dominates the early scenes , though he is well matched by Gemma Jones as his wife Mary . With typical thoroughness , Peck immersed himself in the part , learning to ride , plough and pleach hedges . Although the film was made on a tight budget , the director had time to scout out appropriate locations in the area . \`\` We spent far longer researching the locations than we would normally and it was the quality of the landscape and the discovery of the perfect farmhouse at Llanfihangel Nant Bran near Sennybridge which was critical to its success , '' said Grieve at a screening of the film at Borderlines Film Festival in 2006 .

We have examined the effects of five other estrogens: estriol, estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol, and the metabolism-resistant analogs ethynyl estradiol and moxestrol. All were full agonists for both effects, and all were more potent for the stimulation of cell growth than for stimulation of PRL production. The order of analog potency for both biological effects was the same as the order of potency for inhibiting saturable [3H]estradiol binding to intact cells. Therefore, both biological effects appear to be mediated through the same receptor, and metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol is unlikely to account for the difference in the concentrations required to elicit the two effects. We selected two estrogen-responsive clones from a cDNA library made from GH4C1 cells. The clones were chosen because they were induced at the estrogen concentrations that stimulate growth. Estradiol caused maximal stimulation of the mRNAs corresponding to the two recombinant clones at 10(-10) M, a concentration over 10-fold lower than that required for maximal stimulation of PRL mRNA.

In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant.

They became a transitional group between early hard rock and heavy metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. The band's current lineup includes vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Paul Raymond and drummer Andy Parker. They have gone through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had two hiatuses (1983-1984 and again from 1989 to 1991).\\n\\nTensions had begun to grow between Mogg and Schenker in the late 1970s, possibly from Schenker often leaving before or during shows. Soon after UFO's show in Palo Alto, California on 29 October 1978, Schenker left the band. He made a brief return to the Scorpions before going on to form his own Michael Schenker Group.  After Schenker's exit, UFO rehired Paul \\"Tonka\\" Chapman on guitar who brought over unused track ideas from Lone Star's drummer Dixie Lee. Shortly after, they released their next LP, No Place to Run in January, 1980. Produced by former Beatles producer George Martin, No Place To Run failed to match up to the success of its predecessors, though it fractionally missed the UK Top 10. Paul Raymond left the band at the end of the No Place To Run tour and was replaced by John Sloman from Uriah Heep for a couple of months and then by former Wild Horses guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, who helped fill the void in the songwriting left by Schenker's departure. Carter debuted with UFO on stage at the three-day Reading Festival on 23 August 1980, when the band played as the Saturday night headline act. At the beginning of the following year, UFO released the self-produced The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent, which had a lighter pop rock sound, which was popular at the time. The album achieved mild success in the UK, reaching the UK Top 20, and the single \\"Lonely Heart\\" was released.  In February 1982 the band released Mechanix. It was very successful in the UK, where it reached No.8, the band's highest ever placing. Later that year, founding member Pete Way left the band to form Fastway with Motorhead guitarist \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke and then his own band, Waysted. He was replaced by Talas bassist, Billy Sheehan. UFO released Making Contact in 1983, but the album was a critical and commercial failure. Thus, that March, UFO decided to disband. The band played a UK farewell tour with Paul Gray (ex Eddie and the Hot Rods and The Damned bassist). However, there was a hint that this might not be permanent, when UFO released a compilation album featuring songs by UFO (as well as other groups featuring ex-members of UFO) entitled Headstone, the sleeve of which showed a headstone, denoting UFO with their formation date but an incomplete end date.  This proved to be a short hiatus as, just short of two years later, in late 1984, Mogg assembled a new UFO line-up, featuring Paul Gray on bass again, ex-Diamond Head drummer Robbie France (replaced in 1985 by former Magnum drummer Jim Simpson), and Atomik Tommy M (Tommy McClendon), a former roadie who also wrote lyrics for Loudness, on guitar, with Paul Raymond rejoining shortly after and released Misdemeanor. This was followed by the 1988 EP Ain't Misbehavin. Despite the renewed activity of the band, neither release was financially successful and they officially disbanded again in 1989 after a string of guitarists replacing McClendon: Myke Gray of Jagged Edge in late 1987, in 1988 former Legs Diamond guitarist Rik Sanford and Tony Glidewell, while Pete Way rejoined on bass, and finally in 1989 future Cold Sweat guitarist Erik Gamans.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- A girl group is a music act featuring several female singers who generally harmonize together. The term \\"girl group\\" is also used in a narrower sense in the United States of America to denote the wave of American female pop music singing groups, many of whom were influenced by doo-wop, and which flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s between the decline of early rock and roll and start of the British Invasion.\\n\\n- The mass media is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication. The technologies through which this communication takes place include a variety of outlets.\\n\\n- Doo-wop is a genre of music that was developed in African-Americans communities of New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles in the 1940s, achieving mainstream popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (19141978) is often called the \\"Godfather of Doo-wop\\" for his introducing the \\"top and bottom\\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics.\\n\\n- Gospel music is a music genre in Christian music. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. Gospel music usually has dominant vocals (often with strong use of harmony) with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century, with roots in the black oral tradition. Hymns and sacred songs were repeated in a call and response fashion. Most of the churches relied on hand clapping and foot stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done a cappella. The first published use of the term \\"Gospel Song\\" probably appeared in 1874. The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. Gospel music publishing houses emerged. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music. Following World War II, gospel music moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate.\\n\\n- California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.\\n\\n- Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".\\n\\n- The British Invasion was a phenomenon that occurred in the mid-1960s when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom, as well as other aspects of British culture, became popular in the United States, and significant to the rising \\"counterculture\\" on both sides of the Atlantic.

While it is a literal reflection of the king and queen, Snyder writes \\"it is the image of exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character\\"  Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that Velázquez's portrait is \\"the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princess—a mirror of the princess\\". The painting is likely to have been influenced by Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, of 1434. At the time, van Eyck's painting hung in Philip's palace, and would have been familiar to Velázquez. The Arnolfini Portrait also has a mirror positioned at the back of the pictorial space, reflecting two figures who would have the same angle of vision as does the viewer of Velázquez's painting; they are too small to identify, but it has been speculated that one may be intended as the artist himself, though he is not shown in the act of painting. According to Lucien Dällenbach:\\nThe mirror [in Las Meninas] faces the observer as in Van Eyck's painting. But here the procedure is more realistic to the degree that the \\"rearview\\" mirror in which the royal couple appears is no longer convex but flat. Whereas the reflection in the Flemish painting recomposed objects and characters within a space that is condensed and deformed by the curve of the mirror, that of Velázquez refuses to play with the laws of perspective: it projects onto the canvas the perfect double of the king and queen positioned in front of the painting. Moreover, in showing the figures whom the painter observes, and also, through the mediation of the mirror, the figures who are observing him, the painter achieves a reciprocity of gazes that makes the interior oscillate with the exterior and which causes the image to \\"emerge from its frame\\" at the same time that it invites the visitors to enter... contains an answer for the question: What are the names of the two paintings that have a mirror positioned in the back of the pictorial space?, what is it ?","target":"Las Meninas","rationale":"The answer is Las Meninas."},{"source":"Here is a question about this article: Express highways such as Hu–Ning, Ning–He, Ning–Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently.

He was the husband of Neaera, or according to Homer, of Amphithea. Autolycus fathered Anticlea (who married Laertes of Ithaca and was the mother of Odysseus) and several sons, of whom only Aesimus is named.\\n\\n- Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin.\\n\\n- Hellen was the mythological progenitor of the Hellenes, the son of Deucalion (or sometimes Zeus) and Pyrrha, brother of Amphictyon and father of Aeolus, Xuthus, and Dorus. His name is also another name for Greek, meaning a person of Greek descent or pertaining to Greek culture, and the source of the adjective \\"Hellenic\\".\\n\\n- Poseidon (Greek: ) was one of the twelve Olympian deities of the pantheon in Greek mythology. His main domain was the ocean, and he is called the \\"God of the Sea\\". Additionally, he is referred to as \\"Earth-Shaker\\" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the \\"tamer of horses\\". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and a beard.\\n\\n- Heracles ( \\"Hrakls\\", from \\"Hra\\", \\"Hera\\"), born Alcaeus (\\"Alkaios\\") or Alcides (\\"Alkeids\\"), was a divine hero in Greek mythology, the son of Zeus and Alcmene, foster son of Amphitryon and great-grandson and half-brother (as they are both sired by the god Zeus) of Perseus. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be Heracleidae and a champion of the Olympian order against chthonic monsters. In Rome and the modern West, he is known as Hercules, with whom the later Roman emperors, in particular Commodus and Maximian, often identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the Central Mediterranean. Details of his cult were adapted to Rome as well.\\n\\n- Jason (\\"Iásn\\") was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was famous for his role as the leader of the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. He was married to the sorceress Medea. He was also the great-grandson of the messenger god Hermes, through his mother's side.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Amythaon (\\"gen\\".: ) was a son of Cretheus and Tyro and brother of Aeson and Pheres. He dwelt at Pylos in Messenia, and by Idomene, his niece, or by Aglaia became the father of Bias, Melampus, and Aeolia. His wife Idomene is sometimes said to be daughter of Abas, king of Argos. According to Pindar, he and several other members of his family went to Iolcus to intercede with Pelias on behalf of Jason. Pausanias mentions him among those to whom the restoration of the Olympic Games was ascribed. A part of Elis was thought to have been named Amythaonia after him.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Athamas was a Boeotian king. He was a son of Aeolus and Enarete, and sired several children by his first wife, the goddess Nephele, and his other wives Ino and Themisto. Nephele first bore to him the twins Phrixus and Helle; and also a third son, Makistos. He subsequently married Ino, daughter of Cadmus, with whom, he had two children: Learches and Melicertes.\\n\\n- Aeolus (\\"Aiolos\\" , Modern Greek: ), a name shared by three mythical characters, was the ruler of the winds in Greek mythology. These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which. Diodorus Siculus made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear that he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here. Briefly, the first Aeolus was a son of Hellen and eponymous founder of the Aeolian race; the second was a son of Poseidon, who led a colony to islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea; and the third Aeolus was a son of Hippotes who is mentioned in \\"Odyssey\\" and the \\"Aeneid\\" as the Keeper of the Winds. All three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship, especially regarding the second and third Aeolus, is often ambiguous.\\n\\n- Acastus is a character in Greek mythology. He sailed with Jason and the Argonauts, and participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Dorus is a son of Hellen who was the eponymous founder of the Dorians. Each of Hellen's sons founded a primary tribe of Greece: Aeolus the Aeolians, Dorus the Dorians and Xuthus the Achaeans (from Xuthus's son Achaeus) and Ionians (from Xuthus's adopted son Ion, in truth a son of the god Apollo), aside from his sister Pandora's sons with Zeus. According to the \\"Bibliotheke\\", \\"Dorus received the country over against Peloponnese and called the settlers Dorians after himself.\\"\\n\\n- Pindar (\\"Pindaros\\") (c. 522  c. 443 BC) was an Ancient Greek lyric poet from Thebes. Of the canonical nine lyric poets of ancient Greece, his work is the best preserved. Quintilian wrote, \\"Of the nine lyric poets, Pindar is by far the greatest, in virtue of his inspired magnificence, the beauty of his thoughts and figures, the rich exuberance of his language and matter, and his rolling flood of eloquence, characteristics which, as Horace rightly held, make him inimitable.\\" His poems can also, however, seem difficult and even peculiar. The Athenian comic playwright Eupolis once remarked that they \\"are already reduced to silence by the disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning\\". Some scholars in the modern age also found his poetry perplexing, at least until the 1896 discovery of some poems by his rival Bacchylides; comparisons of their work showed that many of Pindar's idiosyncrasies are typical of archaic genres rather than of only the poet himself. His poetry, while admired by critics, still challenges the casual reader and his work is largely unread among the general public.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Canace was a daughter of Aeolus and Enarete, and lover of Poseidon. Her brothers were Athamas, Cretheus, Deioneus, Magnes, Perieres, Salmoneus and Sisyphus. Her sisters were Alcyone, Arne, Calyce, Peisidice, Perimede and Tanagra. With Poseidon, she was the mother of Aloeus, Epopeus, Hopleus, Nireus and Triopas.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Pyrrha was the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora and wife of Deucalion.\\n\\n- Deucalion was the son of Prometheus; ancient sources name his mother as Clymene, Hesione, or Pronoia. He is closely connected with the Flood myth, according to which, the anger of Zeus was ignited by the hubris of the Pelasgians. So Zeus decided to put an end to the Bronze Age. According to this story, Lycaon, the king of Arcadia, had sacrificed a boy to Zeus, who was appalled by this savage offering. Zeus unleashed a deluge, so that the rivers ran in torrents and the sea flooded the coastal plain, engulfed the foothills with spray, and washed everything clean. Deucalion, with the aid of his father Prometheus, was saved from this deluge by building a chest. Like the Biblical Noah and the Mesopotamian counterpart Utnapishtim, he uses his device to survive the deluge with his wife, Pyrrha.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Xuthus or was a son of Hellen and Orseis and founder (through his sons) of the Achaean and Ionian nations. He had two sons by Creusa: Ion and Achaeus and a daughter named Diomede.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, as recorded in Homer's \\"Iliad\\", Patroclus was the son of Menoetius, grandson of Actor, King of Opus, and Achilles' beloved comrade and brother-in-arms.\\n\\n- Diodorus Siculus (\\"Diodoros Sikeliotes\\") ( 1st century BC) or Diodorus of Sicily was a Greek historian. He is known for writing the monumental universal history \\"Bibliotheca historica\\", much of which survives, between 60 and 30 BC. It is arranged in three parts. The first covers mythic history up to the destruction of Troy, arranged geographically, describing regions around the world from Egypt, India and Arabia to Greece and Europe. The second covers the Trojan War to the death of Alexander the Great. The third covers the period to about 60 BC. \\"Bibliotheca\\", meaning 'library', acknowledges that he was drawing on the work of many other authors.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology , Cretheus ( / kriis , krijus / ; Greek :  Krtheus ) was the king and founder of Iolcus , the son of Aeolus ( son of Hellen ) and Enarete . His wives were Tyro and either Demodice or Biadice . With Tyro , he fathered Aeson , Pheres , and Amythaon . He also had several daughters , namely Hippolyte , future wife of Acastus ( otherwise known as Astydameia ) ; Myrina , who married Thoas ; and an unnamed daughter , who became the mother of Asterius by Teutamus .\\n\\n- Amphictyon, in Greek mythology, was the second son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, although there was also a tradition that he was autochthonous (born from the earth); he is also said to be a son of Hellen son of Deucalion and Pyrrha. Amphictyon was king of Thermopylae and married a daughter of Cranaus of Athens. According to some accounts this daughter was named Atthis, although this conflicts with other accounts which relate that she died young as an unmarried virgin. Amphictyon eventually deposed Cranaus, proclaiming himself king of Athens.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Pheres, son of Cretheus and Tyro and brother of Aeson and Amythaon, was the founder of Pherae in Thessaly. He fled there from Iolcus after his half-brother, Pelias, seized the throne. He married Periclymene, daughter of Minyas, and became the father of Admetus, Lycurgus, Eidomene (wife of Amythaon or Bias) and Periopis (possible mother of Patroclus). Of them Admetus was the husband of the famous Alcestis, who died in his stead and was rescued by Heracles, while Pheres, despite his old age, would not do the same for his son.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Tyro was the daughter of Salmoneus and married Cretheus, but loved Enipeus. She gave birth to Pelias and Neleus, the twin sons of Poseidon. With Cretheus she had Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon.\\n\\n- The Calydonian or Aetolian Boar is one of the monsters of Greek mythology that had to be overcome by heroes of the Olympian age. Sent by Artemis to ravage the region of Calydon in Aetolia because its king failed to honour her in his rites to the gods, it was killed in the Calydonian Hunt, in which many male heroes took part, but also a powerful woman, Atalanta, who won its hide by first wounding it with an arrow. This outraged some of the men, with tragic results. Strabo was under the impression that the Calydonian Boar was an offspring of the Crommyonian Sow vanquished by Theseus.\\n\\n- The Aeneid is a Latin epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC, that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who travelled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Salmoneus was a son of Aeolus and Enarete, and brother of Athamas, Sisyphus, Cretheus, Perieres, Deioneus, Canace, Alcyone, and Perimede. Salmoneus was the father of Tyro by his first wife Alcidice, the second one being Sidero.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology Sisyphus (') was the king of Ephyra (now known as Corinth). He was punished for his self-aggrandizing craftiness and deceitfulness by being forced to roll an immense boulder up a hill, only to watch it come back to hit him, repeating this action for eternity. Through the classical influence on modern culture, tasks that are both laborious and futile are therefore described as Sisyphean.\\n\\n- Pelias was king of Iolcus in Greek mythology, the son of Tyro and Poseidon. His wife is recorded as either Anaxibia, daughter of Bias, or Phylomache, daughter of Amphion. He was the father of Acastus, Pisidice, Alcestis, Pelopia, Hippothoe, Amphinome, Evadne, Asteropeia, and Antinoe.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Alcimede (\\"mighty cunning\\") was one of the matrilineal Minyan daughters, the daughter of Clymene, Minyas' daughter. She was the mother of Jason by Aeson, whom she met in the caves below Iolcus in Thessaly, a chthonic lair where the rightful king Aeson had been imprisoned by his evil half-brother Pelias.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Perieres was King of Messene, an ancient polis in southern Peloponnese. His parentage and offspring vary across ancient authors; in most sources, however, he was a son of Aeolus and Enarete, and husband of Gorgophone, daughter of the famous Perseus. \\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Aeson (\\"Aísn\\") was the son of Cretheus and Tyro. He had two other brothers Pheres and Amythaon. Aeson was the father of Jason and Promachus with Polymele, the daughter of Autolycus. Other sources say the mother of his children was Alcimede or Amphinome.

That includes a $200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from $900,000 to $1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was $374,062, the report states. Newman also has a $5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, George Washington helped design the James River and Kanawha Canal in the 18th century to bypass Richmond's rapids, with the intent of providing a water route across the Appalachians to the Kanawha River. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag. As a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the falls, Richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country, including iron works and flour mills, the largest facilities of their kind in the South.

The population coalesced first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. A 1973 military coup saw a change of leadership, but pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died together when their plane was shot down in April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\\nRwanda's economy suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened. The economy is based mostly on subsistence agriculture. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export. Tourism is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely, and visitors pay high prices for gorilla tracking permits.

The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay), and from Suzhou, and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country.

Millions of others who survive face a lifetime of disabilities or early death. And the effects are not just physical. Poor brain development can limit economic success as children become adults. Then the cycle of poverty and hunger often repeats for their children. \\nDoctor Black says hungry children are also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease as adults. He says the studies show that food programs need to place the greatest importance on the first two years of life. Hungry children can suffer the whole life damage from age two. \\nSo it is high time to improve their diets. Diets should include foods rich in vitamin A and other useful things.

The group achieved fame in the 1960s with Motown. Selected Members of the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Formed in 1957 by friends Annette Beard, Rosalind Ashford and Gloria Williams, the group eventually included Martha Reeves, who moved up in ranks as lead vocalist of the group after Williams' departure in 1962.\\n\\nReeves, out of the group temporarily due to illness, recovered and returned; Ashford was replaced by another former member of the Velvelettes, Sandra Tilley, and the group continued to release albums and singles into the early 1970s, although they could not reignite the fire that had made their records successful in the 1960s. Among their late 1960s hits was \\"I Can't Dance to That Music You're Playing\\", which featured singer Syreeta Wright singing the chorus, and peaked at number forty-two. Reeves reportedly hated singing the song sensing it \\"close to home\\". In 1970, the group issued Motown's first protest single, the controversial anti-war song, \\"I Should Be Proud\\", which peaked at a modest forty-five on the R&B singles chart. The song was uncharacteristic of the Vandellas and did nothing to promote the group. On some stations, the flip-side \\"Love, Guess Who\\" was played instead.  In 1971, the group scored an international hit with \\"Bless You\\" (produced by the Jackson 5's producers The Corporation). The song peaked at number fifty-three on the American pop singles chart (the biggest peak of Vandellas' seventies singles), and number twenty-nine on the R&B singles chart. \\"Bless You\\" was their first UK Top 40 hit since \\"Forget Me Not\\", with the song reaching number thirty-three there. \\"Bless You\\" became a top 20 hit in Canada. It was to be the last Billboard Hot 100 hit single for the group. That record also signaled the end of the Motown era. After two successive Top 40 R&B singles, the ballad \\"In and Out of My Life\\" (#22 US R&B) and the Marvin Gaye cover, \\"Tear It On Down\\" (#37 US R&B), the group disbanded following a farewell concert, held at Detroit's Cobo Hall on December 21, 1972.  The next year, Reeves announced plans of starting a solo career. At the same time, Motown Records moved its operations to Los Angeles. When Reeves did not want to move, she negotiated out of her contract with Motown, signing with MCA in 1974, and releasing the critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, Martha Reeves. Despite rave reviews of her work, neither of Reeves' post-Vandellas/Motown recordings produced the same success as they had the decade before. After living what she called \\"a rock & roll lifestyle\\" of prescription pills, cocaine and alcohol, Reeves sobered up in 1977, overcoming her addictions and becoming a born-again Christian.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How did others take the protest single?","target":"the controversial anti-war song, \\"I Should Be Proud\\", which peaked at a modest forty-five on the R&B singles chart.","rationale":"From the sentence, \\"the controversial anti-war song, \\"I Should Be Proud\\", which peaked at a modest forty-five on the R&B singles chart.\\", we can infer that others took this protest single in a negative way.

Tancredo was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1976 and served two terms.\\n\\nTancredo sponsored the Sudan Peace Act. The Sudan Peace Act says \\"A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.\\" The Act passed the House of Representatives with a 359-8 vote, was passed unanimously in the Senate without amendment seven days later, and was signed into law on November 21, 2002.  Tancredo introduced the Mass Immigration Reduction Act. The act would have imposed an indefinite moratorium on immigration to the United States. Under the act, only spouses and children of American citizens would be allowed to immigrate, which Tancredo estimated would amount to 300,000 immigrants annually. The moratorium would last for at least the first five years of the act and, after that, until such time as there were fewer than 10,000 illegal immigrants entering per year. When those conditions were met, immigration would only have been allowed at whatever level the president and both houses of Congress agreed would have no adverse impact on wages, housing, the environment, or schools. When last introduced in 2003, the bill had 11 cosponsors. Organizations that have endorsed Tancredo's bill include: NumbersUSA, Population-Environment Balance, Carrying Capacity Network, Federation for American Immigration Reform, Negative Population Growth, and the American Patrol.

The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\n\\nNow answer this question: What was signalled in 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched an strike on an Italian fleet?","target":"the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes","rationale":"The context mentions that HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto.

The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.","target":"Hammond","rationale":"The description in the question states that Hammond, a city on the eastern side of lake Michigan receives more snowfall each year due to \\"lake effect\\".

Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.;\\nQuestion: What major problem did bitumen as a pigment show itself to be?;\\nIf you can't find the answer, please respond \\"unanswerable\\".\\nAnswer:","target":"unstable","rationale":"The answer is unstable.

We give formalizations of this property and examine existing robust training objectives in view of them. Interestingly, we find that a recent objective by Madry et al. encourages training a model that satisfies well our formal version of the goodness property, but has a weak control of points that are wrong but with low confidence. However, if Madry et al.'s model is indeed a good solution to their objective, then good and bad points are now distinguishable and we can try to embed uncertain points back to the closest confident region to get (hopefully) correct predictions. We thus propose embedding objectives and algorithms, and perform an empirical study using this method. Our experimental results are encouraging: Madry et al.'s model wrapped with our embedding procedure achieves almost perfect success rate in defending against attacks that the base model fails on, while retaining good generalization behavior.","target":"Defending against adversarial perturbations of neural networks from manifold assumption","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nDefending against adversarial perturbations of neural networks from manifold assumption."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a dialogue from a conversation between an agent and a customer.

Passage:Lilleshall was one of a small number of monasteries in England belonging to the rigorist Arrouaisian branch of the Augustinians. A persistent tale, possibly stemming from William Dugdale, the pioneering 17th century historian of Britain's monasteries, claims that there was an Anglo-Saxon church at Lilleshall, dedicated to St Alkmund. Even Dugdale sounded a note of scepticism, and by 1825, when Hugh Owen and John Brickdale Blakeway wrote their history of Shrewsbury, the scepticism was dominant and they would allow only they “could not disprove” the existence of the Anglo-Saxon foundation. much less the even less plausible tale that Alkmund was actually buried at Lilleshall. It seems that legends of early Lilleshall have developed by confusion with the collegiate church of St Alkmund in Shrewsbury, which was dissolved to provide the funding for the abbey. More recent accounts, from Robert William Eyton's of 1856 to the Victoria County History of 1973, entirely skip the Anglo-Saxon period and set the origins of the monastery securely in the years 1145–8, during the reign of King Stephen. These accounts agree that Lilleshall was founded on the initiative of two brothers: Richard de Belmeis, at that time Archdeacon of Middlesex and dean of the college of St Alkmund in Shrewsbury, and Philip de Belmeis, lord of Tong, Shropshire.

Passage 1:Project Dream was the codename of a role-playing video game (RPG) that served as the basis for the 1998 game Banjo-Kazooie. Developed by Rare, it was aimed for release on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and later the Nintendo 64 (N64). The plot revolved around a young boy, Edson, who caused trouble with pirates. The SNES version of Dream used an isometric perspective and had a fairy tale-like theme. After transitioning to the N64, the project became a more complex 3D RPG that had a greater emphasis on the pirate theme. Eventually, Dream was scaled back to a linear platform game in the vein of Donkey Kong Country (1994) that starred Banjo the bear, who became the protagonist of Banjo-Kazooie.\\n Passage 2:He was appointed High Sheriff of Queen's County in 1876. He served in the Life Guards and fought in Egypt in 1882. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Portarlington from 1880 to 1883, when he succeeded his father in the barony and entered the House of Lords. He served as lieutenant colonel in command of the 4th (Militia) Battalion of the Leinster Regiment (Queen's County Militia) from October 1899, and was the first to outfit them with Irish bagpipers. In February 1900 he left for South Africa, where he was posted on special service during the Second Boer War. In recognition of services during the war, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902.\\n Passage 3:Ortenberg was born to a Jewish family on August 8, 1960, in Briarcliff Manor, New York, Ortenberg attended Penn State University and graduated in 1982.

Moving to San Francisco he began his film career with Columbia Pictures in 1985 as a clerk, and joined Hemdale Film Corporation in 1989, where he served as President of Distribution and Marketing after the company filed for bankruptcy and laid off the C level officers of the company before joining Lionsgate Films as their president of theatrical films, where he was the first employee in its Los Angeles office. Ortenberg led Lionsgate's film division as it quickly grew into one of Hollywood's premiere movie studios. In 2009, he left Lionsgate to join the Weinstein company as President of Theatrical Films. In 2011 it was announced that Ortenberg would be CEO of Open Road Films a newly formed movie studio owned by theatre chains AMC Theatres and Regal Entertainment Group.

Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.

The earliest dynasty, known as the \\"Badami Chalukyas\\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century.

Passage 1:Graham Clarke was born in Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey on July 11, 1970. Clarke's parents, Lorain Maria Clarke (née Meola), a homemaker, and Thomas Michael \\"Moose\\" Clarke, a stockbroker were married in 1960 and had three children before Graham: Thomas in 1961, Dennis in 1962, and Martin in 1965. He spent the first seven years of his life in a split-level home in Dumont, New Jersey. He was frequently in the room when his older brother Tommy would have guitar lessons with musician Bob Berger. Bob noted one time when a screaming Graham had scarlet fever \\"That boy's screaming on key! That's a C note.\\" Such exposure to music had an obvious influence on him and there is an oft-told family story that claims the first song Graham ever learned to sing was \\"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,\\" a popular song Tommy was learning on the guitar at the time. At the age of seven, his family moved one town over to Oradell, where he attended St. Joseph Grammar School, and later Bergen Catholic High School. Neither school had a music program so Graham taught himself how to play the guitar using his brother's old fake books.\\n Passage 2:Adkin made his debut for Sussex in a List A match against the touring Bangladeshis at the County Ground, Hove, in 2010. Batting at number eight, Adkin contributed 30 runs to Sussex's total of 253 all out, before he was dismissed by Mashrafe Mortaza. He took the wicket of Jahurul Islam in the Bangladeshis innings, with Sussex dismissing them for 104 to win the match by 149 runs. Later in that season he made his first-class debut against Surrey at Woodbridge Road, Guildford, in the County Championship. He scored 45 in the match and took figures of 1–38 with the ball. With the need to concentrate on his university studies, Adkin made just four first-class appearances in the 2011 season, playing in against Oxford MCCU in May, as well as making three appearances in the County Championship later in the season. Adkin also made two List A appearances in that seasons Clydesdale Bank 40, against Derbyshire and the Netherlands.\\n Passage 3:The Saint Peter's Square and the Piazza Navona sets were built on the same backlot; after completion of scenes at the former, six weeks were spent converting the set, knocking down the Basilica side and excavating of tarmac to build the fountain. As there had been filming at the real Piazza Navona, the transition between it and the replica had to be seamless. To present the Santa Maria del Popolo undergoing renovation, a police station in Rome opposite the real church was used for the exterior; the scaffolding would hide that it was not the church. Cameron built the interior of Santa Maria del Popolo on the same set as the recreated Santa Maria della Vittoria to save money; the scaffolding also disguised this. The film's version of Santa Maria della Vittoria was larger than the real one, so it would accommodate the cranes used to film the scene. To film the Pantheon's interior, two aediculae and the tomb of Raphael were rebuilt to scale at a height of , while the rest was greenscreen. Because of the building's symmetrical layout, the filmmakers were able to shoot the whole scene over two days and redress the real side to pretend it was another.

After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity.

While playing against someone who is upset with you may be uncomfortable for all parties involved (the author describes feeling guilty about doing so), there does not seem to be anything wrong with continuing to play under such circumstances as long as formal rules are followed.\\\\nIn fact, continuing on when faced with an upset opponent can even be considerate since ending a match early would leave them unable to express themselves through gameplay or learn how they might improve going forward through loss experiences -- something which could worsen rather than improve any negative feelings toward each other which resulted from earlier interactions during play.\\\\nTherefore no one acted unethically in this situation nor was anyone wrong specifically within it; however if the post title had instead asked whether anyone else acted unethically outside of this specific interaction then \\\\\\"OTHER\\\\\\" would have been appropriate since repeated bullying behavior seems unethical overall even though its occurrence within one particular match does not necessarily reflect poorly on its perpetrator here specifically.\\"\\""},{"source":"Short general knowledge question: what freeview channel is bbc three?","target":"BBC Three","rationale":"BBC Three is a British digital television channel from the BBC.

The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD.

In an interview for HitQuarters, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his Achilles tendon and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for \\"Halo\\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords.

Cowell was upset that Beyoncé chose to record the song. David Balls, editor of the British media website Digital Spy, asked Tedder during an interview whether \\"Halo\\" had initially been written for Lewis.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the late 20th century. Glass's work has been described as minimal music, having similar qualities to other \\"minimalist\\" composers such as La Monte Young, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley. However, Glass has instead described himself as a composer of \\"music with repetitive structures\\", which he has helped evolve stylistically.\\n\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Glass's lyrical and romantic styles peaked with a variety of projects: operas, theatre and film scores (Martin Scorsese's Kundun, 1997, Godfrey Reggio's Naqoyqatsi, 2002, and Stephen Daldry's The Hours, 2002), a series of five concerts, and three symphonies centered on orchestra-singer and orchestra-chorus interplay. Two symphonies, Symphony No. 5 \\"Choral\\" (1999) and Symphony No. 7 \\"Toltec\\" (2004), and the song cycle Songs of Milarepa (1997) have a meditative theme. The operatic Symphony No. 6 Plutonian Ode (2002) for soprano and orchestra was commissioned by the Brucknerhaus, Linz, and Carnegie Hall in celebration of Glass's sixty-fifth birthday, and developed from Glass's collaboration with Allen Ginsberg (poet, piano - Ginsberg, Glass), based on his poem of the same name.  Besides writing for the concert hall, Glass continued his ongoing operatic series with adaptions from literary texts: The Marriages of Zones 3, 4 and 5 ([1997] story-libretto by Doris Lessing), In the Penal Colony (2000, after the story by Franz Kafka), and the chamber opera The Sound of a Voice (2003, with David Henry Hwang), which features the Pipa, performed by Wu Man at its premiere. Glass also collaborated again with the co-author of Einstein on the Beach, Robert Wilson, on Monsters of Grace (1998), and created a biographic opera on the life of astronomer Galileo Galilei (2001).  In the early 2000s, Glass started a series of five concerti with the Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (2000, premiered by Dennis Russell Davies as conductor and soloist), and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra (2000, for the timpanist Jonathan Haas). The Concerto for Cello and Orchestra (2001) had its premiere performance in Beijing, featuring cellist Julian Lloyd Webber; it was composed in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. These concertos were followed by the concise and rigorously neo-baroque Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra (2002), demonstrating in its transparent, chamber orchestral textures Glass's classical technique, evocative in the \\"improvisatory chords\\" of its beginning a toccata of Froberger or Frescobaldi, and 18th century music. Two years later, the concerti series continued with Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark (2004), composed for the pianist Paul Barnes. The concerto celebrates the pioneers' trek across North America, and the second movement features a duet for piano and Native American flute. With the chamber opera The Sound of a Voice, Glass's Piano Concerto No. 2 might be regarded as bridging his traditional compositions and his more popular excursions to World Music, also found in Orion (also composed in 2004).

Selection of patients was made from among 206 cases of severe disease. Twenty-four patients (36%) sustained remission for at least 5 yr (mean, 11 +/- 0.6 yr) after initial therapy, and 42 (64%) relapsed and were retreated. Patients who sustained remission had shorter durations of illness before therapy (8 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 2 mo, p less than 0.05) and they had greater laboratory improvements during treatment. The frequencies of cirrhosis and death were not significantly greater in patients who relapsed. Of the 42 patients who relapsed, 9 (21%) ultimately entered a sustained remission after retreatment. Remission for at least 5 yr was possible in 33 of the 66 patients (50%). Major drug complications developed more commonly in those who relapsed and required retreatment (59% vs. 29%, p less than 0.05). We conclude that 50% of patients who enter remission during initial therapy may ultimately achieve a sustained remission, especially if their disease is of short duration and adequately suppressed during treatment. Relapse does not affect long-term prognosis, but retreatment is associated with more side effects. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes many examples of numerical data, such as the mean number of years that patients were followed up after initial corticosteroid withdrawal (10 +/- 0.4 yr), the mean number of years that remission was sustained in those who achieved remission (11 +/- 0.6), and the percentage of those who relapsed and required retreatment (64%). These numerical values are important to evaluating the results presented in this study and help to support or refute its conclusions.

Use of the term has been expanded to include reference to cells, social animals like birds and fish, and insects including ants. Collective behavior takes many forms but generally violates societal norms (Miller 2000, Locher 2002). Collective behavior can be tremendously destructive, as with riots or mob violence, silly, as with fads, or anywhere in between. Collective behavior is always driven by group dynamics, encouraging people to engage in acts they might consider unthinkable under typical social circumstances (Locher 2002).\\n\\n- In the social sciences, a social group has been defined as two or more people who interact with one another, share similar characteristics, and collectively have a sense of unity. Other theorists disagree however, and are wary of definitions which stress the importance of interdependence or objective similarity. Instead, researchers within the social identity tradition generally define it as \\"a group is defined in terms of those who identify themselves as members of the group\\". Regardless, social groups come in a myriad of sizes and varieties. For example, a society can be viewed as a large social group.\\n\\n- Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana.\\n\\n- The papaya (or ) (from Carib via Spanish), papaw, or pawpaw is the plant Carica papaya, one of the 22 accepted species in the genus \\"Carica\\" of the family Caricaceae.\\n\\n- Carica is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caricaceae including \\"C. papaya,\\" the papaya (syn. \\"C. peltata\\", \\"C. posoposa\\"), a widely cultivated fruit tree native to the American tropics.\\n\\n- South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- A fad or trend or craze is any form of collective behavior that develops within a culture, a generation or social group and which impulse is followed enthusiastically by a group of people for a finite period of time.\\n\\n- Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"\\n\\n- The Caricaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Brassicales, found primarily in tropical regions of Central and South America and Africa. They are short-lived evergreen pachycaul shrubs or small trees growing to 510 m tall. One species, \\"Vasconcellea horovitziana\\" is a liana and the three species of the genus \\"Jarilla\\" are herbs. Many species bear edible fruit and are source of papain .\\n\\n- The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'has part' with the subject 'creme de papaya'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- 2000\\n - 2002\\n - a\\n - africa\\n - amazon\\n - andes\\n - b\\n - behavior\\n - brazil\\n - c\\n - canada\\n - carica papaya\\n - chile\\n - culture\\n - e\\n - earth\\n - evergreen\\n - family\\n - fish\\n - fruit\\n - group\\n - guadeloupe\\n - haiti\\n - liana\\n - louisiana\\n - member\\n - north america\\n - plant\\n - protected\\n - s\\n - saint martin\\n - social structure\\n - south america\\n - spanish\\n - the americas\\n - time","target":"carica papaya","rationale":"Creme de papaya is a dessert made of blended papaya and vanilla ice cream.

The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich forest will have more honey fungus?\\n\\nHint: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]","target":"Peak Forest","rationale":"The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, in order to further his research.

He played his freshman season of college for the 2014-15 Duke national championship team. Okafor was heavily recruited since before high school and had been at the top of the recruiting rankings for several years. He played high school basketball in Chicago, Illinois for Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, where he earned high school national player of the year awards from McDonald's, USA Today and Parade.\\nContext: In June 2012, Sports Illustrated named him one of their \\"Future Game Changers\\", a group of fourteen young athletes who are considered to be the brightest talents of their respective sport (such as Sarah Hendrickson, Jabrill Peppers, and Taylor Townsend). On September 19 John Calipari made Okafor an offer to play for Kentucky, joining Ohio State, Michigan State, Louisville, Illinois, Duke, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona as programs that have offered Okafor.  Okafor was one of 10 USA Today preseason All-USA selections (along with Aaron Gordon, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, Kasey Hill, Jones, Parker, Julius Randle, Noah Vonleh, Andrew Wiggins). Okafor was named as one of the top 5 Illinois Mr. Basketball contenders (along with Parker, Kendrick Nunn, Sterling Brown and Malcolm Hill) prior to the season by the Chicago Tribune's Mike Helfgot. Whitney Young was the number eight ranked team in the MaxPreps.com national preseason poll. Young entered the season ranked fourteenth in the nation according to ESPN.  On December 20 Okafor and Young lost in overtime to Dakari Johnson's ESPN #1-ranked Montverde Academy. Young was ranked #9 at the time. On January 19, Okafor led Young to an 85-52 victory over Long Beach Polytechnic High School at the Hoophall Classic with 26 points, 7 rebounds and 3 blocks. The victory gave Young a 7-1 record against nationally ranked teams for the year, moving Young to #2 in the USA Today rankings as they prepared for the January 26 crosstown showdown against Simeon and Parker.  In the Chicago Public High School League playoffs February 15 finals contest against Morgan Park High School Okafor tallied 19 points, 14 rebounds and 7 blocked shots, including a game-saving block against Billy Garrett, Jr., in a 60-56 overtime Public League Championship game victory over Morgan Park.

Basically, my brother (let's call him Brian) started a long distance relationship with this girl (let's call her Sandy) less than 2 years ago. Brian is early 30s and Sandy is late 30s and has already been married once before (in case that matters at all). Anyway, they would see each other probably twice a month for a few months (because the drive is something like 16 hours).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAbout 6 months in and Brian decided to move in with her. Brian was living with our parents still, so I'm sure getting out of their house played a factor. Supposedly, their plan was to live out there for a while and then move back here together because they both like this area. My guess is they were doing it that way because she has a house and they would need to get it ready to sell first before moving over here. Well, then all of a sudden, Sandy's mom got really sick. Cancer. So, they decided that they needed to both stay there, which is understandable. But, they decided they needed a bigger house for some reason. So, they sold her house and bought a new house (which seems crazy to me if their plan is to move back here anyway).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThey buy the new house, get all moved in, and suddenly Sandy's mom's cancer is in remission.

And this has all been in the span of one year of him living out there.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, now here we are, a few months shy of a 2-year relationship and he proposed to her. And I'm kinda just feeling weird by it. It seems rushed. Also, she supposedly wants kids, so I get that her clock is ticking on that and that may be why this whole relationship is on the fast track, but I dunno. So, Brian texted me and our other brother about the engagement in a group text and I just ignored it for a week before finally summoning up a \\"congrats on your engagement\\" text in response with an excuse about being busy with life.

A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match.\\n\\nAll women talk about himself.","target":"bad","rationale":"The subject of the sentence is \\"All women\\", which is plural.

She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let's twist and turn one for a good cause, yes?\\nJust before the birth of their only child, daughter Irene, Szigeti found himself stuck in Berlin during the Kapp Putsch of 1920, unable to return to Geneva. The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not go on as planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for \\"interminable days\\" while the Putsch ran its course. Szigeti writes: \\"... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my wife--whose condition I pictured with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective fathers--was certainly a greater torment to me than all the other discomforts put together\\".\\nBy 1940, the outbreak of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States.

Much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90 percent in the lower Columbia basin.Historic Guild's Lake, in the lower Balch Creek watershed near the Willamette River, was named for Peter Guild (pronounced guile), one of the first European American settlers in the area. In 1847, he acquired nearly 600 acres (2.4 km2) of the watershed through a donation land claim. Although variations in the spelling of Guild's Lake occur in historic newspapers, maps, and other documents, Guild's Lake has been the preferred form since the beginning of the 20th century.The creek is named for Danford Balch, who settled a 346-acre (1.40 km2) donation land claim upstream of the Guild property in 1850.

As I stood there soaking in the early morning light, I was reminded of an important lesson.\\nWhen I arrived in San Francisco, I told myself, \\"Just take photos as you do other things.\\" My primary goal was to meet with friends and so I figured I could take pictures as we walked around the city. This resulted in exactly zero photos worth sharing. I had vague ideas like, \\"I'd like to do some street photography,\\" but I never went out with the intent of photographing something specific. Finally, on the last morning, I went out with the intent of capturing a specific picture and I ended up with something worth sharing. My mistake was that I assumed that because I wanted to take photos, I would end up getting a desirable result.\\nHow often do you do this in your own life?

Most of the conventional SSL methods assume that the classes of unlabeled data are included in the set of classes of labeled data. In addition, these methods do not sort out useless unlabeled samples and use all the unlabeled data for learning, which is not suitable for realistic situations. In this paper, we propose an SSL method called selective self-training (SST), which selectively decides whether to include each unlabeled sample in the training process. It is also designed to be applied to a more real situation where classes of unlabeled data are different from the ones of the labeled data. For the conventional SSL problems which deal with data where both the labeled and unlabeled samples share the same class categories, the proposed method not only performs comparable to other conventional SSL algorithms but also can be combined with other SSL algorithms. While the conventional methods cannot be applied to the new SSL problems where the separated data do not share the classes, our method does not show any performance degradation even if the classes of unlabeled data are different from those of the labeled data.","target":"Our proposed algorithm does not use all of the unlabeled data for the training, and it rather uses them selectively","rationale":"Our proposed algorithm does not use all of the unlabeled data for the training, and it rather uses them selectively.

We call these balls Yuanxiao or Tangyuan. Obviously, they get the name from the festival itself. It is said that the custom of eating Yuanxiao originated during the Eastern Jin Dynasty in the fourth century, then became popular during the Tang and Song periods.\\nThe fillings inside the dumplings or Yuansiao are either sweet or salty. Sweet fillings are made of sugar, Walnuts, sesame , osmanthus flowers , rose petals, sweetened tangerine peel, bean paste, or jujube paste . A single ingredient or any combination can be used as the filling . The salty variety is filled with minced meat , vegetables or a mixture.\\nThe way to make Yuanxiao also varies between northern and southern China. The usual method followed in southern provinces is to shape the dough of rice flour into balls, make a hole, insert the filling, then close the hole and smooth out the dumpling by rolling it between your hands. In North China, sweet or nutmeat stuffing is the usual ingredient. The fillings are pressed into hardened cores, dipped lightly in water and rolled in a flat basket containing dry glutinous rice flour. A layer of the flour sticks to the filling, which is then again dipped in water and rolled a second time in the rice flour.

He was also credited with introducing the pogo dance to the scene at the 100 Club. John Robb claims it was at the first Sex Pistols residency gig, 11 May 1976; Matlock is convinced it happened during the second night of the 100 Club Punk Special in September, when the Pistols were off playing in Wales.

In 2014, the Buccaneers were 1-8 entering their matchup at Washington, but rookie receiver Mike Evans torched the Redskins defense for 209 receiving yards, setting up a 27-7 Bucs win. After a quick Washington three-and-out to start the game, Evans picked up right where he left off, beating safety Ryan Clark for a 40-yard touchdown less than two minutes into the game. A second short Redskins drive gave the ball right back to Tampa Bay, and #1 overall pick Jameis Winston wasted no time driving down the field, with back-to-back completions covering 54 yards to Louis Murphy and Evans, respectively. Washington limited the damage, forcing a field goal attempt to only be down 10-0. Their offense continued to stagnate, however, and the Buccaneers quickly regained possession. A methodical, 14-play, 72-yard drive ensued, and the results were a 7-yard touchdown pass from Winston to Donteea Dye and a 17-0 lead. Washington's offense, which ran only 10 plays in the first quarter and only gained one first down (by penalty), managed to cross midfield on their subsequent drive, but Buccaneer defensive end Jacquies Smith sacked Cousins, forcing a fumble that fellow defensive end Howard Jones returned 43 yards for a touchdown. The visiting Buccaneers, all of a sudden, led 24-0. Two rookie receivers, Ryan Grant and Jamison Crowder, caught passes from Cousins totaling 37 yards on the next drive, and Cousins finished it off himself with a 7-yard touchdown run, his second of the season. The rest of the first half would pass without any more fireworks, but the Redskins sorely needed some in the second half to overcome the 17-point halftime deficit they faced. Tampa Bay exited the locker room looking to extend their lead, but could not do so and punted back to the Redskins. A deep pass from Cousins to much-maligned receiver Andre Roberts picked up 38 yards and got them inside Tampa Bay's 10-yard-line. Two plays later, Ryan Grant hauled in a 4-yard touchdown pass to inch closer, 24-14. Redskins coach Jay Gruden made a bold decision, opting to attempt an onside kick. A few Redskins players struggled to handle the ball, but safety Trenton Robinson dove on it and gave Washington a fresh drive just short of midfield. The first play of the drive was a deep Cousins pass to Grant that got Washington inside the 20-yard-line. Two false start penalties unnerved the home crowd, but tight end Jordan Reed made a 3-yard touchdown reception on 3rd-and-goal. In just over eight minutes, the Buccaneers' lead had shrunk from 17 points to only 3. Trying to regain their momentum on the next drive, Tampa Bay gained 44 yards on two Evans catches, but a 43-yard run by Charles Sims was nullified by penalty. Winston threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Evans, but that, too, was nullified due to a pas interference call on Evans. The Buccaneers had to settle for a Connor Barth field goal to make the score 27-21. Washington's next drive had no plays longer than 15 yards, but a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on William Gholston helped them get into Hopkins' range. He countered with a field goal of his own to bring the score back within 3 with 7:29 remaining in the game. Winston and Evans, hoping to put the game out of reach, hooked up twice for a total of 30 yards, and Doug Martin broke free for a 49-yard gain before Bashaud Breeland pushed him out-of-bounds at the 5-yard-line. On third-and-goal from the 1-yard-line, attempting for a 10-point lead with under 3 minutes remaining, Charles Sims was stopped for a loss of 2 yards. The Buccaneers had failed to salt the game away, and Barth's field goal left Washington with a chance to win the game. Washington advanced from their own 20-yard-line to Tampa Bay's 6-yard-line in just 8 plays, all of which were Cousins completions. With only 36 seconds left, Washington had a 1st-and-goal from the 6-yard-line. Two incompletions, Cousins' first two of the drive, followed, but on 3rd down Cousins hit Jordan Reed for a 6-yard touchdown and a 31-30 lead with 24 seconds left on the clock. Tampa Bay still had a chance to kick a game-winning field goal. They had moved the ball to their own 42-yard line, only about 20 yards from Barth's range, when Charles Sims fumbled the ball and Chris Baker recovered it for Washington. They had stormed back from a 24-0 deficit, which was the largest comeback in franchise history. Kirk Cousins became the first quarterback in NFL history with two game-winning touchdowns in the final 30 seconds of games in the same calendar month, and Jordan Reed had the first multi-touchdown game of his career, but perhaps most importantly, coach Gruden had quieted the doubters by inspiring his team to a historic comeback.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"Who had a 2-3 record coming into the game?","rationale":"This is the question I have generated for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: Who had a 2-3 record coming into the game?"},{"source":"Choose your reply from the options at the end.

The goal of this study was to identify the distribution of the v-ATPase in human and murine models of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs) and assess its role in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'We evaluated the immunolabeling pattern of the v-ATPase in human PanIN specimens and murine PanIN-1 and PanIN-2 lesions obtained from Ptf1a(Cre/+); LSL-Kras(G12D) mice. Wnt/β-catenin signaling was interrogated in primary PanIN cells by examining the phosphorylated levels of its surface coreceptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6), and its intracellular effector, nonphosphorylated β-catenin. The response of primary PanIN cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) was assessed in the absence and presence of the v-ATPase inhibitor, concanamycin.', 'In advanced (PanIN-2), but not early (PanIN-1), lesions, the v-ATPase assumed a polarized phenotype. Blocking the v-ATPase disrupted Wnt/β-catenin signaling in primary PanIN cells despite significantly higher levels of the total and activated Wnt cell surface coreceptor, LRP6. Vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase blockade significantly decreased the total and activated levels of EGF receptor, a determinant of PanIN progression. The activation of EGF receptor and its intracellular mediator, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, was also reduced by v-ATPase blockade. This led to diminished proliferation in response to EGF ligand.","target":"Does polarization of the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase delineate a transition to high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm lesions?","rationale":"The most relevant question to the given passage is \\"Does polarization of the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase delineate a transition to high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm lesions?\\" as this question directly relates to the information contained in the passage about v-ATPase."},{"source":"I am hesitating between 4 options to answer the following question, which option should I choose?\\nQuestion: Increased populations can lead to the depletion of locally available resources.

As a child Ziaur Rahman, nicknamed Komol, was reserved, shy, quietly spoken, and intense in many respects. He was raised in Bagbari village, Bogra and studied in Bogra Zilla School.\\n\\nZiaur Rahman became the 7th President of Bangladesh on 21 April 1977. Years of disorder from the previous political administration of the Awami League and BAKSAL had left most of Bangladesh's state institutions in disarray, with constant internal and external threats. Assuming full control of the state, Zia lifted martial law and introduced massive reforms for the development of the country.  In late September 1977, a group of Japanese Red Army terrorists hijacked an aeroplane and forced it to land in Dhaka. On 30 September, while the attention of the government was riveted on this event, a mutiny broke out in Bogra. Although the mutiny was quickly quelled on the night of 2 October, a second mutiny started in Dhaka, led by disgruntled airmen of Bangladesh Air Force (BAF). The mutineers unsuccessfully attacked Zia's residence, captured Dhaka Radio for a short time and killed a good number of air force officers and airmen at Tejgaon International Airport, where they were gathered for negotiations with the hijackers. Wing Commander M. Hamidullah Khan BP (Sector Commander Bangladesh Defence Forces Sector 11), then BAF Ground Defence Commander, quickly put down the rebellion within the Air Force, but the government was severely shaken. Chief of Air Staff AVM AG Mahmud reappointed Wing Commander Hamidullah as Provost Marshal of BAF. Government intelligence had failed and Zia promptly dismissed the DGFI chief, AVM Aminul Islam Khan BAF, of 9th GD(P) formerly of PAF, and also the DG-NSI. In the aftermath at least 200 soldiers involved in the coup attempt were executed following a secret trial, prompting some critics to call Zia \\"ruthless\\".  The size of Bangladesh police forces was doubled and the number of soldiers of the army increased from 50,000 to 90,000. In 1978 he appointed Hussain Muhammad Ershad as the new Chief of Army Staff, promoting him to the rank of Lieutenant General. He was viewed as a professional soldier with no political aspirations (because of his imprisonment in former West Pakistan during the Bangladesh War of Independence) who possessed a soft corner for India.

In late April, the artist posted a twitpic of the track listing for the new album. She also commented that at the time she was \\"open to suggestions\\" regarding the album's title. Two weeks later, a blog posting on her record label's official website revealed that the album would be entitled /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\Y/\\\\, the punctuation marks spelling Maya, M.I.A.'s own forename.

M.I.A.'s official Myspace page uses both titles. The album was released in conventional physical and digital formats and as an iTunes LP.The album's cover features the singer's face almost completely hidden by YouTube player bars. MTV's Kyle Anderson described the cover, which was previewed in June 2010, as \\"a typically busy, trippy, disorienting piece of art\\" and speculated that it might be \\"a statement about 21st century privacy\\".

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

A significant subtext is the impending suppression of the Jesuits, of which Father Gabriel is warned by the film's narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, who was once himself a Jesuit. Altamirano, speaking in hindsight in 1758, corresponds to the actual Andalusian Jesuit Father Luis Altamirano, who was sent by Jesuit Superior General Ignacio Visconti to Paraguay in 1752 to transfer territory from Spain to Portugal. He oversaw the transfer of seven missions south and east of the Río Uruguay, that had been settled by Guaraní and Jesuits in the 17th century.

She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012).\\n\\nIn her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.”\\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway.\\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\\nAndrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge.

The replication licensing machinery is crucial for replication precision as it ensures that replication takes place once per cell cycle. Thus, the expression status of the components comprising the replication licensing apparatus is tightly regulated to avoid re-replication; a form of replication stress that leads to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer. In the present review we discuss the mechanistic basis of replication licensing deregulation, which leads to systemic effects, exemplified by its role in carcinogenesis and a variety of genetic syndromes. In addition, new insights demonstrate that above a particular threshold, the replication licensing factor Cdc6 acts as global transcriptional regulator, outlining new lines of exploration. The role of the putative replication licensing factor ChlR1/DDX11, mutated in the Warsaw Breakage Syndrome, in cancer is also considered. Finally, future perspectives focused on the potential therapeutic advantage by targeting replication licensing factors, and particularly Cdc6, are discussed..

According to his later account, when two of his guests asked him about the possibility of organising a sea excursion, he put them in touch with Bown. On the evening of Saturday 30 July, amid celebrations following England's victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, Bown and his friend Jeffrey Stock, a qualified engineer, visited Greatwood. They found that enthusiasm for a sea trip had spread to many of the guests, and an agreement was made to take a large party to Fowey the following day. Different accounts were given later of the financial basis for the proposed hire – whether it was to be a fixed charge or a rate per head is uncertain.Barratt, the boat's legal owner, professed ignorance of the arrangements made at Greatwood, believing, he said, that Bown had gone there to discuss with Rainbird future charter work once the necessary licences had been obtained. Under local regulations, a licence for carrying up to 12 passengers was subject to examination of the boat by the harbourmaster, who would also require the person in charge to be a licensed skipper. Vessels proposing to carry more than 12 passengers needed a licensed master, a qualified marine engineer, and a Class III Passenger Certificate from the Board of Trade. This certificate was only granted to vessels in good condition with watertight hull compartments, a two-way radio, a qualified radio operator and a range of safety devices.

This organization soon changed its name to \\"The VHF Teletype Society\\" and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype Q code of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSWs test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of \\"The RTTY Society of Southern California\\" publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.\\nWhich two cities in New York were the participants of the first two-way amateur radio teletype Q code of record from?","target":"Brooklyn","rationale":"The first two-way amateur radio teletype Q code of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF from Brooklyn, NY and John Evans Williams (W2BFD) from Woodside Long Island, NY."},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

Her departure devastated Ray Davies, and it inspired him to write the song \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Home\\", included on the 1966 album Face to Face. The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family's plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted. Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the story line and characters in depth, explaining in the liner notes for the album's LP release:\\nArthur Morgan ... lives in a London suburb in a house called Shangri-La, with a garden and a car and a wife called Rose and a son called Derek who's married to Liz, and they have these two very nice kids, Terry and Marilyn. Derek and Liz and Terry and Marilyn are emigrating to Australia. Arthur did have another son, called Eddie. He was named after Arthur's brother, who was killed in the battle of the Somme. Arthur's Eddie was killed, too—in Korea.\\nDavies would later comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later \\"told me that he ... knew it [Arthur] had been partly inspired by him ... [it] reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, saying that he was flattered.\\" With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew (\\"Victoria\\", \\"Young and Innocent Days\\"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons (\\"Australia\\"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home (\\"Shangri-La\\"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War (\\"Mr. Churchill Says\\"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war (\\"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\\"), and the death of his brother in World War I (\\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", \\"Some Mother's Son\\").","target":"Ray","rationale":"From the passage, we can see that Arthur Anning's brother was named Eddie and this is a name he has used for his own son.

We prove that SGD minimizes an average potential over the posterior distribution of weights along with an entropic regularization term. This potential is however not the original loss function in general. So SGD does perform variational inference, but for a different loss than the one used to compute the gradients. Even more surprisingly, SGD does not even converge in the classical sense: we show that the most likely trajectories of SGD for deep networks do not behave like Brownian motion around critical points. Instead, they resemble closed loops with deterministic components. We prove that such out-of-equilibrium behavior is a consequence of highly non-isotropic gradient noise in SGD; the covariance matrix of mini-batch gradients for deep networks has a rank as small as 1% of its dimension. We provide extensive empirical validation of these claims, proven in the appendix.","target":"SGD implicitly performs variational inference; gradient noise is highly non-isotropic, so SGD does not even converge to critical points of the original loss","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nSGD implicitly performs variational inference; gradient noise is highly non-isotropic, so SGD does not even converge to critical points of the original loss."},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nWhen we look at monkeys and humans they have a lot of matching DNA meaning they are similar or very different? \\n\\n\\nParagraph :\\n\\nThe more similar the DNA molecules of different species are, the closer the relationship is likely to be.","target":"similar","rationale":"The paragraph explains that the closer two species are genetically, the more similar their DNA molecules will be.

Passage 1:This newer generation of social networking sites began to flourish with the emergence of SixDegrees.com in 1997, followed by Open Diary in 1998, Mixi in 1999, Makeoutclub in 2000, Hub Culture and Friendster in 2002 or Canada's first online social network Nexopia in 2003, and soon became part of the Internet mainstream. However, thanks to the nation's high Internet penetration rate, the first mass social networking site was the South Korean service, Cyworld, launched as a blog-based site in 1999 and social networking features added in 2001. It also became one of the first companies to profit from the sale of virtual goods. Friendster was followed by MySpace and LinkedIn a year later, and eventually Bebo. Friendster became very popular in the Pacific Islands. Orkut became the first popular social networking service in Brazil (although most of its very first users were from the United States) and quickly grew in popularity in India (Madhavan, 2007). Attesting to the rapid increase in social networking sites' popularity, by 2005, it was reported that Myspace was getting more page views than Google. Facebook, launched in 2004, became the largest social networking site in the world in early 2009. Facebook was first introduced as a Harvard social networking site, expanding to other universities and eventually, anyone. The term social media was introduced and soon became widespread.\\n Passage 2:The band appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 1995, performing \\"Camel Walk\\" from their album Dirt Track Date, where Jay Leno jokingly said Drew Carey performed on drums.

In 1286, Rudolph of Habsburg granted Veldenz town and market rights. By 1444, the castle and its environs had passed to the Counts of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, or between 1543 and 1694 the Principality of Palatinate-Veldenz. In 1752, in Burgen near Veldenz, the widely known robber, Johann Peter Petri, also known as Schwarzer Peter (“Black Peter”), was born. From 1777 to 1797, Veldenz belonged to Bavaria. After French rule as part of Sarre department, it was annexed to Prussia in 1815. In 1835 the Veldenz Lion was adopted as the Bavarian Lion in that kingdom's coat of arms.

If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication).\\n\\nOver time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8]\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations.\\n\\nAnswer this question please: Which path will have higher pheromone density?","target":"path A","rationale":"The context of this question states that the ants travel down one of two paths, path A and B. The pheromone density for each will depend on how often workers use each path to bring food back to their colony. Ricky's measurements show that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, while path B is 150 meters long. This suggests that it would take longer for an ant traveling along a shorter distance (path A) than a longer distance (path B). Since the evaporation rate depends on time spent traveling, less time means more frequent trips by individual ants which results in higher pheromone density over time. Thus, based on the given information Path A will have higher pheromone density as compared with Path B since they are both used frequently but Path A"},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nRay was traveling in rocket leaving orbit.

Nintendo's intention, however, was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself. Nintendo required that they be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year. A 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips also reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit 25% of publishers' requests for cartridges. This was an average figure, with some publishers receiving much higher amounts and others almost none. GameSpy noted that Nintendo's \\"iron-clad terms\\" made the company many enemies during the 1980s.

He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensryche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Parader's list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time.\\n\\nWhile Tate was in the band Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensryche) at a local rock festival. After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs. Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensryche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensryche in 2012.  The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future. The band already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song \\"The Lady Wore Black\\", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensryche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensryche's permanent lead singer. Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left.  Queensryche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983, with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums. EMI re-released the EP, Queensryche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensryche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.  On June 20, 2012, it was announced that Queensryche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre. Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005-2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensryche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name. It was revealed to the public on April 28, 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensryche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Geoff Tate","rationale":"The text is a biography of the musician Geoff Tate.

In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering.\\n\\n- The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family.\\n\\n- A panicle is a much-branched inflorescence. Some authors distinguish it from a compound spike, by requiring that the flowers (and fruit) be pedicellate. The branches of a panicle are often racemes. A panicle may have determinate or indeterminate growth.\\n\\n- Asteraceae or Compositae (commonly referred to as the aster, daisy, composite, or sunflower family) is an exceedingly large and widespread family of flowering plants (Angiospermae).\\n\\n- Connation in plants is the developmental fusion of organs of the same type, for example, petals to one another to form a tubular corolla. This is in contrast to adnation, the fusion of dissimilar organs. Such organs are described as connate or adnate, respectively. When like organs that are usually well separated are placed next to each other, but not actually connected, they are described as connivent (that is the case for anthers in several genera, such as \\"Solanum\\").\\n\\n- A raceme (or ) is an unbranched, indeterminate type of inflorescence bearing \\"pedicellate\\" flowersflowers having short floral stalks called pedicelsalong its axis. In botany, an \\"axis\\" means a shoot, in this case one bearing the flowers. In indeterminate inflorescence-like racemes, the oldest flowers are borne towards the base and new flowers are produced as the shoot grows, with no predetermined growth limit. A plant that flowers on a showy raceme may have this reflected in its scientific name, e.g. \\"Cimicifuga racemosa\\". A compound raceme, also called a panicle, has a branching main axis. Examples of racemes occur on mustard (genus \\"Brassica\\") and radish (genus \\"Raphanus\\") plants.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- In botany, shoots consist of stems including their appendages, the leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds. The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants.\\n\\n- Calamagrostis ( small reed or reed grass ) is a genus in the grass family Poaceae , with about 260 species that occur mainly in temperate regions of the globe . Towards equatorial latitudes , species of Calamagrostis generally occur at higher elevations . These tufted perennials usually have hairless narrow leaves . The ligules are usually blunt . The inflorescence forms a panicle . Some may be reed - like . The plants may be rhizomatous ( underground stems with shoots ) , stoloniferous ( with runners ) , or caespitose ( growing in tufts or clumps ) . The bisexual spikelets have a single floret and generally they are purple or purple - brown . The spikelets are clustered into inflorescences , which usually develop in early - to mid-summer on long culms ( = stems ) . Some Calamagrostis can be very decorative ; for example , in North America , Britain and Europe , a hybrid cultivar of Calamagrostis ( Calamagrostis x acutiflora ' Karl Foerster ' ) is widely grown as an ornamental grass . The word \`\` calamagrostis '' is derived from the Greek word kalamos ( reed ) and agrostis ( a kind of grass ) . Many species of Calamagrostis are morphologically similar , but they generally occur in distinct habitats , and they have unique geographical distributions . Given the subtle distinctions between many closely related taxa , there are several species complexes that could benefit from additional systematic study . Even the generic boundaries of the genus are controversial . For example , species in the genus Deyeuxia , distributed largely in the southern hemisphere are morphologically very similar to species of Calamagrostis . It may be appropriate to recognize all of these species in a single genus , but this will require detailed scientific study of DNA of species from around the world .\\n\\n- A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.\\n\\n- In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.\\n\\n- The Rubiaceae are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the coffee, madder, or bedstraw family. It consists of terrestrial trees, shrubs, lianas, or herbs that are recognizable by simple, opposite leaves with interpetiolar stipules. The family contains about 13,500 species in 611 genera, which makes it the fourth-largest angiosperm family. Rubiaceae has a cosmopolitan distribution, however, the largest species diversity is concentrated in the (sub)tropics. Economic importance includes \\"Coffea\\", the source of coffee, \\"Cinchona\\", the source of the antimalarial alkaloid quinine, some dye plants (e.g. \\"Rubia\\"), and ornamental cultivars (e.g. \\"Gardenia\\", \\"Ixora\\", \\"Pentas\\").\\n\\n- A lawn is an area of soil-covered land planted with grasses or (rarely) other durable plants such as clover which are maintained at a short height with a lawnmower and used for aesthetic and recreational purposes. Common characteristics of a lawn are that it is composed only of grass species, it is subject to weed and pest control, it is subject to practices aimed at maintaining its green color (e.g., watering), and it is regularly mowed to ensure an acceptable length, although these characteristics are not binding as a definition. Lawns are used around houses, apartments, commercial buildings and offices. Many city parks also have large lawn areas. In recreational contexts, the specialised names turf, pitch, field or green may be used, depending on the sport and the continent.\\n\\n- An inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem that is composed of a main branch or a complicated arrangement of branches. Morphologically, it is the part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed and which is accordingly modified. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes.\\nInflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern.\\n\\n- In botany, phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem (from Ancient Greek \\"phýllon\\" \\"leaf\\" and \\"táxis\\" \\"arrangement\\"). Phyllotactic spirals form a distinctive class of patterns in nature.\\n\\n- Poaceae or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses. Poaceae includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns (turf) and pasture. Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. With ca 780 genera and around 12,000 species, Poaceae are the fifth-largest , following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- Poa is a genus of about 500 species of grasses, native to the temperate regions of both hemispheres. Common names include meadow-grass (mainly in Europe and Asia), bluegrass (mainly in North America), tussock (some New Zealand species), and speargrass. \\"Poa\\" is Greek for fodder. \\"Poa\\" are members of the Pooideae subfamily of the Poaceae family.\\n\\n- A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.\\n\\n- The Fabaceae, Leguminosae or Papilionaceae, commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean family, are a large and economically important family of flowering plants. It includes trees, shrubs, and perennial or annual herbaceous plants, which are easily recognized by their fruit (legume) and their compound, stipulated leaves. The family is widely distributed, and is the third-largest land plant family in terms of number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 751 genera and some 19,000 known species\\n. The five largest of the genera are \\"Astragalus\\" (over 3,000 species), \\"Acacia\\" (over 1000 species), \\"Indigofera\\" (around 700 species), \\"Crotalaria\\" (around 700 species) and \\"Mimosa\\" (around 500 species), which constitute about a quarter of all legume species. The ca. 19,000 known legume species amount to about 7% of flowering plant species. Fabaceae is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.\\n\\n- Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae), however sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n\\n\\n'calamagrostis' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- amaranthaceae\\n - angiospermae\\n - angiosperms\\n - animal\\n - area\\n - areas\\n - aster\\n - asteraceae\\n - axis\\n - bambusoideae\\n - cinchona\\n - coffea\\n - crotalaria\\n - cyperaceae\\n - fabaceae\\n - gardenia\\n - homo\\n - indigofera\\n - lamiaceae\\n - magnoliophyta\\n - mimosa\\n - orchidaceae\\n - pea\\n - pentas\\n - plant\\n - poa\\n - poaceae\\n - polygonaceae\\n - pooideae\\n - rubiaceae\\n - seed plants\\n - solanum","target":"pooideae","rationale":"A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology.

The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist).

The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974.\\n\\nBefore leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones released Undercover (UK 3; US 4) in late 1983. Despite good reviews and the Top Ten peak position of the title track, the record sold below expectations and there was no tour to support it. Subsequently, the Stones' new marketer/distributor CBS Records took over distributing the Stones' Atlantic catalogue.  By this time, the Jagger/Richards rift had grown significantly. To Richards' annoyance, Jagger had signed a solo deal with CBS Records, and he spent much of 1984 writing songs for his first album. He also declared his growing lack of interest in the Rolling Stones. By 1985, Jagger was spending more time on solo recordings, and much of the material on 1986's Dirty Work was generated by Richards, with more contributions by Wood than on previous Rolling Stones albums. The album was recorded in Paris, and Jagger was often absent from the studio, leaving Richards to keep the recording sessions moving forward.  In June 1985, Jagger teamed up with David Bowie for \\"Dancing in the Street\\", which was recorded as part of the Live Aid charity movement. This was one of Jagger's first solo performances, and the song reached No. 1 in the UK, and No. 7 in the US. In December 1985, Stewart died of a heart attack. The Rolling Stones played a private tribute concert for him at London's 100 Club in February 1986, two days before they were presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.  Dirty Work (UK No. 4; US No. 4) was released in March 1986 to mixed reviews despite the presence of the US Top Five hit \\"Harlem Shuffle\\". With relations between Richards and Jagger at a low, Jagger refused to tour to promote the album, and instead undertook his own solo tour, which included Rolling Stones songs. As a result of the animosity within the band during this period, they almost broke up. Jagger's solo records, She's the Boss (UK 6; US 13) (1985) and Primitive Cool (UK 26; US 41) (1987), met with moderate success, and in 1988, with the Rolling Stones mostly inactive, Richards released his first solo album, Talk Is Cheap (UK 37; US 24). It was well received by fans and critics, going gold in the US. Richards has subsequently referred to this late-80s period, where the two were recording solo albums with no obvious reunion of the Stones in sight, as \\"World War III\\".

Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the United Nations. He entered diplomatic service the year he graduated from university, accepting his first post in New Delhi, India.\\n\\nAfter graduating from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam. He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 1970 and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the Yusin Constitution.  Ban's first overseas posting was to New Delhi, India, where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the United States, because in India he would be able to save more money to send to his family. In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea became a full UN member-state on 17 September 1991). After Park Chung-hee's 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.  In 1980 Ban became director of the United Nations' International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in Seoul. He has been posted twice to the South Korean embassy in Washington, D.C. Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990-92. In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and North Korea of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. From 1993 to 1994 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996. Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.  Ban was appointed Ambassador to Austria and Slovenia in 1998, and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO PrepCom). During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included in a public letter a positive statement about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2001, not long after the United States had decided to abandon the treaty. To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by President Kim Dae-jung, who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.  Ban was unemployed for the only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy. In 2001, during the 56th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, South Korea held the rotating presidency, and to Ban's surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president Han Seung-soo.

The question asks how winds could best benefit this area. There are four answer options: (A) The winds could blow oil spills into the bay; (B) The winds could be converted to fossil fuel; (C) The winds could blow air pollution toward land; and (D) The winds could be converted to electrical energy. Option A is out of scope as it does not state how wind can benefit this area, but rather leads to negative consequences for this region. Option B is also out of scope because converting wind to fossil fuel requires burning fossil fuels, which would produce air pollution that would negatively impact people living in this area by causing respiratory illnesses. Thus, option C is incorrect as well because it may lead to an increase in air pollution nearshore from conversion technologies used in option B. Option D states that we can convert wind power into electrical energy using wind turbines onshore or offshore near these shores, so no fossil fuels are needed for conversion and therefore reduces air pollution around these areas by reducing human reliance on burning fossil fuels for generating electricity. As a result, option D provides a potential solution on how we can best utilize natural resources provided by local conditions such as coastal or offshore breezes or gusts blowing towards land from seas or oceans nearby."},{"source":"In this task, you will be shown a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending.

The University of Manchester is a red brick university, a product of the civic university movement of the late-19th century.\\n\\n- Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 . It lies within the United Kingdom's second-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.55 million. Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council.\\n\\n- Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.\\n\\n- Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.\\n\\n- Red brick university (or redbrick university) is a term originally used to refer to six civic universities founded in the major industrial cities of Great Britain in the 19th century. The term is now used more broadly to refer to British universities founded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in major cities. All of the six original redbrick institutions, or their predecessor institutes, gained university status before World War I and were initially established as civic science or engineering colleges.\\n\\n- Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries.

The observatory was established in 1945 by Sir Bernard Lovell, a radio astronomer at the University of Manchester who wanted to investigate cosmic rays after his work on radar during the Second World War. It has since played an important role in the research of meteors, quasars, pulsars, masers and gravitational lenses, and was heavily involved with the tracking of space probes at the start of the Space Age. The managing director of the observatory is Professor Simon Garrington.\\n\\n- The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, is among the largest astrophysics groups in the UK. It includes the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the MERLIN/VLBI National Facility, the Development Office of the Square Kilometre Array, and the Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre. The Centre was formed after the merger of the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST which brought two astronomy groups together. \\n\\n- The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a large multi radio telescope project aimed to be built in Australia and South Africa. If built, it would have a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre. It would operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size would make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. It would require very high performance central computing engines and long-haul links with a capacity greater than the current global Internet traffic. It should be able to survey the sky more than ten thousand times faster than ever before.\\n\\n- The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) was a university based in the centre of the city of Manchester in England.
