Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

However, there are limited data on the molecular epidemiology of the HRV types involved. Objectives: To determine whether a large respiratory outbreak in a LTCH was caused by a single type of HRV, and to describe the clinical impact of the outbreak. Study design: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from residents with one or more of the following: fever, cough, rhinitis, or congestion. Specimens were interrogated by multiplex PCR using the ResPlex II assay. Samples positive for HRV were then submitted for genotyping by partial sequence analysis of the 5 untranslated (UTR) and viral protein (VP) 1 capsid regions. Results: Of 71 screened, 56 residents were positive for a HRV during an outbreak that lasted 5.5 weeks; 27 healthcare workers also had respiratory symptoms. Three residents were transferred to hospital and 2 died. Seven units in two wings of the LTCH were affected, resulting in 3152.5 resident unit closure days. Three different HRV genotypes were identified, although HRV-A1 dominated. Conclusions: This large outbreak of HRVs among residents and healthcare workers in a LTCH was associated with substantial resident and staff morbidity as well as significant unit closures. Multiple types of HRV were implicated but an HRV-A1 type dominated, warranting further investigation into viral determinants for virulence and transmission.","target":"Co-circulation of multiple genotypes of human rhinovirus during a large outbreak of respiratory illness in a veterans' long-term care home","rationale":"A title should provide information about the main objective and result of a study.

Additionally, the thickness of platelet aggregates and the platelet distribution on the endocardium were also evaluated.   \\n RESULTS Atrial fibrillation was associated with a significant increase of endocardial CD40 expression (293.1+/-55.1 pg/ml vs. 230.9+/-53.3 pg/ml, p<0.01), and platelet-endocardial adhesion compared with sinus rhythm atria (10.8+/-2.2 vs. 5.2+/-1.3 platelet CD41 AU p<0.01).

In terms of water, adhesion is the bonding of a water molecule to another substance, such as the sides of a leaf's veins. This process happens because hydrogen bonds are special in that they break and reform with great frequency. This constant rearranging of hydrogen bonds allows a percentage of all the molecules in a given sample to bond to another substance. This grip-like characteristic that water molecules form causes capillary action , the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in a narrow space. An example of capillary action is when you place a straw into a glass of water. The water seems to climb up the straw before you even place your mouth on the straw. The water has created hydrogen bonds with the surface of the straw, causing the water to adhere to the sides of the straw. As the hydrogen bonds keep interchanging with the straw's surface, the water molecules interchange positions and some begin to ascend the straw.","target":"increase","rationale":"The amount of water at the bend will increase given enough time, because capillary action is what causes water to rise in a thin tube like a straw. Capillary action occurs when molecules are attracted by adhesion and cohesion (the attraction of one molecule to another).

But as soon as Gus gets behind this he intervenes and apparently only by Walt's pleading lets Jesse live. He tries to arrange peace between Jesse and the dealers to avoid any further trouble. And as a compromise he tells the dealers    No more kids.   when Jesse tells him about Tomas (though, it's hard to imagine Gus didn't know about the usage of kids as subordinates, let alone care about it at all). And so far so good the peace seems settled.  But then suddenly Tomas ends up killed and I can't wrap my head around why (other than to further the story by making things escalate). Sure, for the dealers it might be an easy way to dispose of him, now that they're told \\"no more kids\\", but I don't think they would hazard such an action without permission from Gus. And I can't see what Gus really gained from Tomas' death. Even as an act of defiance to show Jesse who's the boss it doesn't make so much sense, seeing that he was quite interested in the \\"peace treaty\\" to avoid further trouble and he knew Jesse's temper and that this was bound to cause trouble once Jesse learns about it. If he really wanted the situation to escalate and get rid of Walt and Jesse, he could have offed them a lot easier and more unexpectedly.

Jane didn't do anything about it yet, because she has fewer aphids on her farm, but she vows to do so in the near future.\\n\\nHint: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.","target":"Bill","rationale":"Since the question is asking about farmers with more aphids resistant to common insecticide, this means that those insects are not affected by the use of any type of pesticide.

Neither side made much progress on 5 July, but the 6th produced a definitive outcome. Both sides launched major assaults on their flanks. Austrian attacks against the French left wing looked dangerous initially, but they were all beaten back.

We were friends for a year, year and a half, maybe?  The context of this friendship: I needed a reason to get out of my house and away from my borderline-abusive sister, and he needed some company as his family grew busy and were rarely home.  Though we had little history, our relationship was cathartic, and we'd spew whatever the hell we had on our minds - basically, a lot of unfiltered thinking out loud, without fear of judgement.  From the start, we agreed on one thing: we were both very inexperienced socially, had social anxiety, and in my case the question of high-functioning autism has been raised by several teachers and doctors.  We were to be blunt and clear with each other, ask for clarification when we were confused.  No hidden resentments, no unvoiced objections about the other's rant of the day, etc.  No wondering if that tone was suggestive or not - we would ask, and we would know, and that was comforting to the both of us.\\n\\nThis also meant there was NO question about what we were.  We were not romantically involved.  Until the event I'll cover in a minute, I didn't think there was confusion even without our agreement to be blunt.  In fact, this was the first non-asexual person to whom I outed myself as asexual.  Whether or not me outing myself is relevant to what happened next, I am unsure.\\n\\nWe went to the drive-in movies one night.  I didn't have a car or a license, so we went in his car.  We left a little early to avoid the jam on the way out, and he told me he was out of gas.  Like, he was driving on E all day.  This is where shit got weird.\\n\\nHe wanted to go to the gas station near his house.  His house was WELL out of town, and that gas station was maybe like the tenth on the list of ones closest to us.  It struck me as odd, but I figured he might just have a coupon or membership or some other discount for that station, and since he'd paid for the tickets I didn't say anything about it.  I don't remember if I offered then, but if it were to happen now, I'd offer to pay for the gas (and insist on a closer station).  We get to that gas station and the outside lights are off, but the inside lights are on.  We can't see any other cars in the lot.  The gas station door sits wide open.  He locks me in the car and goes in, and then rushes back out.  There was no cashier, just someone in the back rifling through shelves.  We got the fuck outta there and he said \\"There's this back highway by my mom's house, if we go down that for ten minutes we'll find a gas station there.\\"\\n\\nAnd I think, *there's no way in hell we're driving ten more minutes out of town*.  If the gas ran out, we didn't need to be in the middle of nowhere (which - the town itself is just one tier above \\"middle of nowhere\\").  While I didn't have my license, I did have a learner's permit, and I knew the roads pretty well.  I told him we were better off returning to the drive-in and stopping at a gas station near there.\\n\\nFrom here, something in my gut was telling me something was *wrong*.  He would not make eye contact with me.  He was very intently focused on the road, which was unlike him.  He really didn't want to go back into town, and he started giving me excuses for it: we could just stop at his one of his parents' houses until one of them came home (in three hours).  We could still go to that other gas station he knew of.  I chalked this up to nerves and insisted no, we need to get out of dark residential areas and onto lit streets, we need to be near town where we have multiple stations and tow options, we need to stay where there's wifi/phone signal, etc., and he agreed we should return to town.\\n\\n2 minutes down the familiar highway into town, there's an intersection, and despite 1) agreeing to return to town and 2) him taking this route to school every day for the past 2 years, he is in the wrong lane when we pull up to the intersection.  He tells me that there's a cop here and it's too late, he has to head down this other single-lane road that leads out into the prairie.  And he doesn't say \\"I'll u-turn\\" or \\"I'll turn around\\", he says \\"We'll look down that way for a gas station.\\"  He wants to drive down that road.\\n\\nBut there *is no cop*, and I have no idea where that road goes, and this is where I realize that I might be in trouble.  I am locked in, I am far too small to get the wheel away from him, and nobody knows we are out here.  We weren't supposed to come this way, let alone down a road neither of us was familiar with.  I cannot let him take that road.\\n\\nI tell him to turn anyway, fuck the cop.  There's nobody else out here at 2 in the morning.  We're not hurting anyone.  And I *yell* this.  Loudly.  Over halfway through the intersection, he turns, and we resume the road back into town.\\n\\nFrom here, he continues to give excuses to get us off the main road.  \\"I don't know this place\\", \\"this doesn't look familiar\\", etc.  This is still the route he would have taken every weekday for the past two years.  It's... literally just take this highway, the only four-lane highway, all the way to the high school, where you turn onto the main street.  It's not a hard route.  I drove it once before this and I knew where we were.  I direct him to a gas station in the middle of town.  It is well-lit, no robbery this time.  While he's filling up I text my sister to tell her we're close to the house (my parents made her stay up and wait for me because last time I was out late, I got locked out of the house - I had no idea if she was actually waiting, though).  When he gets back in the car, even though she hadn't responded yet, I told him she texted me asking where I was and that I told her we were on our way.  My house was also quite a ways out of town, in the other direction - a route he was much less familiar with, but after hearing my sister was up and waiting, he had no more trouble navigating darker, smaller, more confusing streets to get to my house.\\n\\nOnce I'm safe, I write down what I remember happening for later reference and spend an hour calming down, then go to bed.  And what followed was years of me wondering what the fuck happened.  I cannot stress how bad my gut feeling had been that night.  I am a forgiving person.  I've forgiven and salvaged friendships from worse, believe it or not.  But that night every ounce of trust I had in this dude *evaporated*.  Every instinct I had was screaming *danger, danger*, to the point where I considered grabbing at the wheel anyway and forcing us off the road once we were a little closer to town and someone might stop to check on us.  I almost did, at that isolated intersection with the invisible cop.  Had his weird behavior been because of the robbery (which - I didn't realize until now, actually, that I never saw this robbery; I'm pretty sure he wasn't lying about what he saw inside b/c what I saw outside was also so strange), or had there actually been bad intentions?  If it *was* bad intentions, how far had he planned to go, and what had stopped him until I'd had the chance to contact my sister?  Not long after this happened, I wrote about the incident for a class.  It was a private assignment, just read by the teacher, and I kept the kid's name out of it (this teacher didn't know him, anyway).  The teacher said I was right to trust my gut.  Years after, I have come to the following conclusion, the only one that reconciles the strange events of the night, my gut feeling, and who I knew this dude to be:\\n\\nHe had no bad intentions.  He didn't go into it with a plan to put hands on me.  I think what he wanted was for us to end up in a house or in the car alone with nothing else to do so he'd have a chance to make a move, set the mood, whatever you'd want to call it.  I don't think he'd have touched me without consent.  But it just... never crossed his mind that locking me in his car and trying to force us first to his house and then into the middle of nowhere without telling me why would be *terrifying*.  It would breach our pact about being blunt, but we did have social anxiety, and maybe he took \\"asexual\\" to mean \\"straight but a little nervous\\" and decided a sideways approach was best.  Maybe, once we were parked somewhere, he would have bluntly asked.  But he never got farther than trying to set the stage, because of the robbery and my insistence we head back into town instead.  I am very certain that this is what happened.\\n\\nHe didn't contact me for two months after that.  He knew he'd done something wrong.  After some time had passed (though - keep in mind I was still processing what happened, hadn't quite reached the above conclusion, still had no idea what he'd intended that night) he asked if I wanted to join him for lunch or something.  I turned him down.  I was terrified of the thought of being alone with him again.  He invited himself to my graduation at the end of the school year, and I told my classmate - \\"Don't leave me alone with him.\\"  She didn't treat him badly or anything - in fact, they hung out with each other more than I did with either of them - but she followed my request without question.  He rode with me and my mother to the ceremony and we exchanged a few words, but he spoke mostly to my mother.  He was avoiding me, too.\\n\\nI never addressed him directly about what happened, and that's where I wonder if I'm the asshole.\\n\\nSee, I was afraid to be alone with him, but this wasn't something I could ask him about in front of others.  I could have texted, but every time I chickened out.  It seemed like a conversation best had face-to-face, like texting would result in misunderstandings and reading with the wrong tone.  If his answer was \\"No, I was just nervous,\\" I don't think I would have believed him right away.

Skip Navigation Search Re: How long to recover from a hysterectomy Unfortunately when i go back the only way out is to file another FMLA claim. It takes time to see if metlife approves it. Recovering from your hysterectomy The Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancers at Dana-Farber provides a variety of services to help patients and their families cope with the many physical, emotional, and spiritual challenges of a cancer diagnosis and its treatment. Sometimes a hysterectomy includes removal of one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes, a procedure called a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy (sal-ping-go-o-of-uh-REK-tuh-me). A hysterectomy can also be performed through an incision in the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy) or by a laparoscopic or robotic surgical approach — which uses long, thin instruments passed through small abdominal incisions. An abdominal hysterectomy may be recommended over other types of hysterectomy if: You have a large uterus. Recovery will depend on the type, extent, and reason for the procedure. A brief hospital stay may be needed. Full recovery can take from 4 to 8 weeks depending on the procedure and the health status of the patient. Some activities, such as heavy lifting, sex, tub bathing, and tampon use may be temporarily advised against. People keep telling me how great I’m going to feel in a few weeks when my iron levels recover from a year of almost constant bleeding. I can’t wait. As of today I’m officially cleared for driving. I’ll be happier when I’m cleared to get back on my bike, but that may be a few weeks yet. Recovery Time For Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Patients A majority of laparoscopic patients can get back to work and other activities within two weeks of the surgery. Some people may want to take it easy and should not lift anything heavy, even when their surgeon clears them. First, each person heals differently from one another. Second, the surgical procedure chosen, such as an abdominal hysterectomy or a vaginal laparoscopic assisted hysterectomy, can determine your recovery time. Third, the reason for your surgery can have a big impact on how much time you need to recover. For instance, if you have uterine cancer, it is going to take more time to recover from the disease and the surgery. Hysterectomy Procedure Example Your surgeon might recommend LAVH or robotic hysterectomy if you have scar tissue (pelvic adhesions) on your pelvic organs from prior surgeries or from endometriosis. After the procedure. After surgery, you'll be in a recovery room for a few hours and in the hospital for one to two days, possibly longer. Many women have asked what they can do to help themselves recover after having a hysterectomy. Most of the strategies are common sense tips to overall good health. The suggestions listed below are meant to help you feel better faster and prevent complications. This can be used as a useful guide during your recovery and in the future.

Passage 1:The programme explores the lives of King George V and Queen Mary, and their attempts at modernising the British Monarchy in response to the massive social changes during and following World War I. The first episode recalls how, fearing anti-German sentiment, the royal house name was changed by King George from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor. The series also examines the personal lives of the couple, delving into their relationships with their children, and with each other. The marriage between George and Mary was an arranged marriage, occurring only because Prince Albert Victor, George's brother and Mary's original fiancé, died from influenza. George V is presented in the series as a disciplinarian, who strictly punished his children, but was known to be much more loving to his granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II.\\n Passage 2:He attended the Colegio San Luis Gonzaga and afterwards the Colegio Civil of Querétaro from 1883 to 1887.

I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness.\\nBut when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker.\\nField recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.\\nQuestion: When did the author think colomba would make a very good baking project?\\nAnswer:","target":"always","rationale":"The author says, \\"I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project\\".

The new record came on a seven-yard completion to Donald Driver. Ryan Grant and Greg Jennings each had a touchdown during the game, making it the first time two Packers players have each scored a touchdown in the same four consecutive games. Atari Bigby was voted the GMC Defensive Player of the Week for games played on December 13 - 17. Bigby made four tackles and two interceptions (a career-high). Bigby intercepted the ball on the Packers' 22-yard line late in the second quarter to keep the Packers ahead by three going into halftime. Kicker Mason Crosby was voted the Diet Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week for games played on December 13 - 17. Crosby went four-for-four in field goals, including a long 50-yard field goal and 46-yard and 44-yard kicks, and three-for-three in extra points. With the Carolina Panthers defeating the Seattle Seahawks on the day, the Packers clinched a first round bye for the playoffs.\\n\\nWho caught the longest pass in the third quarter?","target":"WR Greg Jennings","rationale":"In the third quarter, we can see that Favre completed a 44-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.","target":"Earth I","rationale":"Since Earth I did not protect the environment, it would have more greenhouse gases trapped in its atmosphere.

When it opened in 1930, it was the largest building in the world, with 4,000,000 square feet (372,000 m2) of floor space. The art deco landmark is located at the junction of the Chicago River's branches. The building is a leading retailing and wholesale destination, hosting 20,000 visitors and tenants per day as of the late 2000s.\\n\\nWholesale showrooms occupy 50% of the usable floor space, and the Sultan of Brunei once spent $1.6 million at the Mart to furnish his entire palace, claiming the location was the only place where the task could be completed in one week. Select showrooms are open only to wholesalers, with others accessible to the general public. Unlike stores with traditional shelf and rack displays, entire usable rooms are created, providing consumers an opportunity to compare form and function between applications and manufacturers. A portion of the stores offer items for purchase singly or as a collection, while others offer design services, preservation, renovation, or installation. In addition to being a resource for architects and decorators, the Mart also has featured award-winning designs as selected by the American Institute of Architects. Catering to suppliers, on-site firms specialize in providing professional services for market research projects.  In 1931, Marshall Field and Company lost five million dollars, followed by eight million in 1932. The wholesale division was greatly reduced and Field's reduced its space in the Mart from four floors to one and half. The Mart continued to display the latest trends in home furnishings within the showrooms and trade shows. The company recovered late in the decade, but did not return to all previously occupied space.  In 1942, L. L. Skaggs formed a partnership with three other men and named the partnership the Owners Service Company, hence Osco. The headquarters moved from Waterloo, Iowa, to the Merchandise Mart.  A retail shopping area, named The Shops at the Mart, opened in 1991 and includes apparel shops, beauty services, bookstores and newsstands, financial services, telecommunication services, travel services, specialty food and wine stores, photo services, a dry cleaner, shoe shine stand, and a food court. A U.S. Post Office is located on the first floor and a FedEx location is on the second floor.  The Apparel Center houses the 521-room Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza River North hotel, the offices of the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago campus of the Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago, as well as the Chicago office of the Ogilvy & Mather advertising agency.

Mutagenesis of Hxt11 yielded transporters that show a better affinity for d-xylose as compared to d-glucose while maintaining high transport rates. d-glucose and d-xylose co-consumption is due to a redistribution of the sugar transport flux while maintaining the total sugar conversion rate into ethanol. This method provides a single transporter solution for effective fermentation on lignocellulosic feedstocks.","target":"yes","rationale":"The passage states that the yeast S. cerevisiae has a cryptic sugar transporter named Hxt11, which is not associated with effective d-xylose transport.

This cut the Burma Road which was the western Allies' supply line to the Chinese Nationalists. In March 1942, Chinese Expeditionary Force started to attack Japanese forces in northern Burma. On 16 April, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division led by Sun Li-jen. Cooperation between the Chinese Nationalists and the Communists had waned from its zenith at the Battle of Wuhan, and the relationship between the two had gone sour as both attempted to expand their area of operations in occupied territories. Most of the Nationalist guerrilla areas were eventually overtaken by the Communists. On the other hand, some Nationalist units were deployed to blockade the Communists and not the Japanese. Furthermore, many of the forces of the Chinese Nationalists were warlords allied to Chiang Kai-Shek, but not directly under his command. \\"Of the 1,200,000 troops under Chiang's control, only 650,000 were directly controlled by his generals, and another 550,000 controlled by warlords who claimed loyalty to his government; the strongest force was the Szechuan army of 320,000 men.

These areas, called growth plates , allow the bones to grow longer as the child grows. By the time the child reaches an age of about 18 to 25 years, all of the cartilage in the growth plate has been replaced by bone. This stops the bone from growing any longer. Even though bones stop growing in length in early adulthood, they can continue to increase in thickness throughout life. This thickening occurs in response to strain from increased muscle activity and from weight-lifting exercises.\\n\\nParagraph: Two brothers, Tom, aged 26, and Paul, aged 16 were into sports. Tom started weight-lifting to gain more muscle mass. Three years later he was 20-25 lbs. heavier.

Passage:The knifetooth sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), also known as the pointed sawfish or narrow sawfish, is a species of sawfish in the family Pristidae, part of the Batoidea, a superorder of cartilaginous fish that includes the rays and skates. Sawfish display a circumglobal distribution in warm marine and freshwater habitats. Their extant biodiversity is limited to five species belonging to two genera (Pristis and Anoxypristis). The sawfishes are characterised by the long, narrow, flattened rostrum or extension on their snout. This is lined with sharp transverse teeth, arranged in a way that resembles the teeth of a saw. It is found in the shallow coastal waters and estuaries of the Indo-West Pacific, ranging from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to southern Japan, Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. It is the only living member of the genus Anoxypristis, but was previously included in the genus Pristis.

Cobain said he was unaware of the deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted it as a revolutionary slogan, as they had been discussing anarchism and punk rock.\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was, along with \\"Come as You Are\\", one of several songs written following Nirvana's first recording sessions with producer Butch Vig in 1990.

Contact is lost with the control facility and what is discovered is that a race of aliens has taken control of the giant monsters. The giant monsters are sent to many different cities across the world and the human race must then wrestle control of the giant monsters back from the aliens. Fun stuff!Video:I'm torn here. I really, really wanted to love this release. What is there is 1080p HD in name, but the detail quality seems kind of low. I don't know what happened, but the colors seem washed out and faded while there are some instances of dust and dirt to be seen. Interestingly enough, you can still see the control cables and wires used for various special effects, so perhaps this was the best that could be done with it? I've read (and a commenter stated the possibility) that the source was a 35mm print.In my mind, the Blu Ray doesn't look to be much better than an upscaled DVD. I don't have the Media Blasters DVD to compare directly, so I don't know if it really is an upscale or not, but every indication points to this being a true HD source.Disappointing from an HD perspective certainly. If this is the same quality that was released in Japan (can't verify myself, sorry), then that tells me it is a source issue, but I don't know because I can't compare.Forums I've been to indicate this is the same master used on the Japanese release, but take that for what it is worth without validation.Audio:5.1 Japanese, along with 2.0 Japanese and English 2.0 (2 audio streams for English). I watched in Japanese 5.1 and the music and effects seem to be well separated in the front speakers, while the rear channels barely got much use. Since this was original recorded in 2.0 stereo anyway, I flipped over and I have to say the stereo separation is just about as good in my mind as the 5.1 in Japanese.I spot checked the English audio tracks and they seem to be on par in terms of audio quality as the Japanese. In terms of the quality of the English dub, I leave that to others to decide. Seems OK to me, but I expect hokey English on my giant monster movies anyway!Based on a comment on my review, I went back to check the English dub. I can confirm, without question, that BOTH the AIP AND the \\"International\\" Toho dub are, in fact, on this disc. Both English tracks are, however, in 2.0 Stereo ONLY. There is no 5.1 English dub. Not that most people who wanted the AIP dub would care that much, considering the film was in 2.0 stereo originally anyway.Packaging:For those of you in love with the image Amazon has up, be prepared to be disappointed. Or not, if you hated it. From the time it was displayed here to time of release, the cover has been changed. If you check out the Destroy All Monsters wikipedia entry, this release uses the poster artwork displayed there. It looks good to me.Otherwise the packaging is pretty bare bones. No inserts in the case or anything. Serviceable, but at $30 MSRP I'd have hoped for something a little better.Extras:Commentary is pretty good. Very nice to have it included.All of the trailers are in standard definition, which is OK I suppose.All of the Extras content is 480i and NOT 1080p.You get original trailers (English, Japanese, French (poor audio quality), RADIO spots for the AIP dub (English only with still images from the film) ), a storyboard image gallery, an 8mm reel from AIP (quality is poor, but it's still really cool to see this!) and image gallery.In my original Amazon review I ended up passing over a lot of the extras, so for that, I am terribly sorry.The extras on this disc are pretty fantastic in my mind. Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock put a lot of love into pulling together all of this material.Final Verdict:Destroy All Monsters is one of the best Godzilla movies around. It deserves to be owned, certainly. The Blu Ray release is probably the prettiest release the movie has seen, though that's not saying much with some of the previous releases.I've given it 4 stars because of the sloppy video (possibly not Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock's fault, I don't know). What is outstanding is the audio. Video drops the review by a star.If you don't already own it and enjoy the film, this is definitely worth picking up. If you are OK with the video quality on prior release and don't care about the AIP dub, keep your money.If you want the AIP English dub, this is THE release to get.Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock did an outstanding job on this release. Pulling together the trailers, the radio spots and even the commentary shows me that they actually appreciate the release as much as many fans. The video quality is the only mar on an outstanding release and it is something I can look past, as I've since learned that the video is from Toho's own remastered (in 2008) video.If you are a Godzilla fan, this is definitely worth the purchase price without question.\\nquestion: Is the video good?","target":"sloppy video","rationale":"The correct answer is not present in exact form.

Throughout the 1930s, the study was his base for the writing of many of his most successful books.

He later adopted the name Anna, which in Marathi means \\"elder person\\" or \\"father\\".\\n\\nHazare was drafted in the Indian Army in April 1960, where he initially worked as an army truck driver and was later attested as a soldier. He undertook army training at Aurangabad.  During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Hazare was posted at the border in the Khem Karan sector. He was the sole survivor of an enemy attack--variously claimed to have been a bomb, an aerial assault and an exchange of fire at the border--while he was driving a truck. The experiences of wartime, coupled with the poverty from which he had come, affected him. He considered suicide at one point but turned instead to pondering the meaning of life and death. He said of the truck attack, \\"[It] sent me thinking. I felt that God wanted me to stay alive for some reason. I was reborn in the battlefield of Khem Karan. And I decided to dedicate my new life to serving people.\\" At a book stand in New Delhi railway station, he came across Swami Vivekananda's booklet \\"Call to the youth for nation building\\" which inspired him to think deeper. He spent his spare time reading the works of Swami Vivekananda, Gandhi, and Vinoba Bhave. In a blog post, Hazare expressed his views on Kashmir by saying that it was his \\"active conviction that Kashmir is an integral part of India\\" and that if required once again for service, he would remain \\"ready to take part in war against Pakistan.\\"  During his fifteen-year career in the army (1960-75), Anna Hazare was posted at several locations, including Punjab (Indo Pak war 1965), Nagaland, Bombay (1971) and Jammu (1974)  During the Indo pak war, Hazare survived a road crash while driving for the army. He interpreted his survival as a further sign that his life was intended to be dedicated to service. He had another escape in Nagaland, where one night, underground Naga rebels attacked his post and killed all the inmates.

In this study, we observed that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection significantly triggered EGR1 expression. Overexpression of EGR1 suppressed FMDV replication in porcine cells, and knockdown of EGR1 considerably promoted FMDV replication. A previously reported FMDV mutant virus (with two amino acids mutations in SAP domain) that displays a strong type I interferon (IFN) induction activity was used in this study. We found that SAP mutant FMDV infection induced a higher expression of EGR1 than wildtype FMDV infection, and also triggered higher IFNβ and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression than wildtype FMDV infection. This implied a link between EGR1 and type I IFN signaling. Further study showed that overexpression of EGR1 resulted in Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and NF-κB promoter activation. In addition, the SeV-induced ISGs expression was impaired in EGR1 knockdown cells. EGR1 upregulation promoted type I IFN signaling activation and suppressed FMDV and Seneca Valley virus replication. Suppression of the transcriptional activity of EGR1 did not affect its antiviral effect against FMDV. This study reveals a new mechanism evolved by EGR1 to enhance type I IFN signaling and suppress FMDV replication. \\n Title: Citation: Early Growth Response Gene-1 Suppresses Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Replication by Enhancing Type I Interferon Pathway Signal Transduction","target":"False","rationale":"The title \\"Citation: Early Growth Response Gene-1 Suppresses Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Replication by Enhancing Type I Interferon Pathway Signal Transduction\\" is not a good title for this paragraph.

Dynamic analysis, one of the most effective approaches to finding software bugs, has become paralyzed due to the lack of a generic emulator capable of running diverse previously-unseen firmware. In recent years, we have witnessed devastating security breaches targeting IoT devices. These security concerns have significantly hamstrung further evolution of IoT technology. In this work, we present Laelaps, a device emulator specifically designed to run diverse software on low-cost IoT devices. We do not encode into our emulator any specific information about a device. Instead, Laelaps infers the expected behavior of firmware via symbolic-execution-assisted peripheral emulation and generates proper inputs to steer concrete execution on the fly. This unique design feature makes Laelaps the first generic device emulator capable of running diverse firmware with no a priori knowledge about the target device. To demonstrate the capabilities of Laelaps, we deployed two popular dynamic analysis techniques---fuzzing testing and dynamic symbolic execution---on top of our emulator. We successfully identified both self-injected and real-world vulnerabilities.","target":"Device-agnostic Firmware Execution","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nDevice-agnostic Firmware Execution"},{"source":"Please answer this question: when did the us and ussr become allies?","target":"June 1941","rationale":"The answer is based on the history of World War II and Russia's participation in it. \\nRussia was a part of Axis countries from June 1940 to December 1941 when they were attacked by Germany, which caused them to join the Allies faction that included United States at that time.

In this paper, we take a brand-new perspective about transfer: we suggest that the ability to assign credit unveils structural invariants in the tasks that can be transferred to make RL more sample efficient. Our main contribution is Secret, a novel approach to transfer learning for RL that uses a backward-view credit assignment mechanism based on a self-attentive architecture. Two aspects are key to its generality: it learns to assign credit as a separate offline supervised process and exclusively modifies the reward function.

These earlier approaches suffer from several drawbacks: useful information about the relationships between the error components in a closed-loop system is not fully utilized; the response intercept cannot be directly estimated; and the normalization procedure required in some methods may fail under certain circumstances. This paper proposes a new, general method of simultaneously estimating the response slope and intercept from corrupted stimulus-response data when the errors in both variables are specifically related by the system structure. A direct extension of the least-squares approach, this method [directed least squares (DLS)] reduces to ordinary least-squares methods when either of the measured variables is error free and to the reduced-major-axis (RMA) method of Kermack and Haldane (Biometrics 37: 30-41, 1950) when the magnitudes of the normalized errors are equal. The DLS estimators are scale invariant, statistically unbiased and always assume the minimum variance. With simple modifications, the method is also applicable to paired data. If, however, the relation between error components is uncertain, then the RMA method is optimal, i.e., having the least possible asymptotic bias and variance. These results are illustrated by using various types of closed-loop respiratory response data.","target":"Animal","rationale":"The paper proposed a new method for simultaneously estimating the response slope and intercept from corrupted stimulus-response data.

The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.\\n\\n- The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau  constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.\\n\\n- The canton of Zug is one of the 26 cantons of Switzerland. It is located in central Switzerland and its capital is Zug. At 239 km the canton is one of the smallest of the cantons in terms of area. It is not subdivided into districts, but eleven municipalities.\\n\\n- Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.\\n\\n- Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. \\nThe country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.\\n\\n- The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).\\n\\n- In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries).\\n\\n- Zug (  Neo-Latin Tugium), is a municipality and a town in Switzerland. The name \\"Zug\\" originates from fishing vocabulary; in the Middle Ages it referred to the right to \\"pull up\\" fishing nets and hence to the right to fish.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'zug massacre'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- area\\n - border\\n - capital\\n - city\\n - climate\\n - concept\\n - confederation\\n - constitutional monarchy\\n - continent\\n - country\\n - crime\\n - economy\\n - eight\\n - empire\\n - event\\n - federal republic\\n - fish\\n - form of government\\n - government\\n - history\\n - hundred\\n - index\\n - italy\\n - january\\n - july\\n - lake\\n - mass\\n - massacre\\n - mediterranean sea\\n - member\\n - metropolis\\n - metropolitan\\n - monarchy\\n - mountain\\n - mountain range\\n - municipality\\n - murder\\n - murderer\\n - name\\n - ocean\\n - part\\n - people\\n - phase\\n - plateau\\n - politics\\n - principality\\n - range\\n - rank\\n - republic\\n - river\\n - seat\\n - september\\n - sovereign state\\n - state\\n - suicide\\n - surface\\n - system\\n - territory\\n - three\\n - time\\n - town\\n - two","target":"event","rationale":"Zug massacre is an event entity, so the answer is 'event'."},{"source":"Determine the topic of the question-answer pair.\\nQuestion: \\"what is lean manufacturing and who developed?\\";  Answer: \\"Lean manufacturing, lean enterprise, or lean production, often simply, \\"Lean,\\" is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination.\\"?

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones.\\nFollowing the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice.

In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can be either an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.\\n\\n- Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'daubigny's garden' exhibits the relationship of 'material used'.

It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them.

Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects. That is to say that if a person's data were in a database, that person's attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields. The term \\"object-relational impedance mismatch\\" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object databases and object-relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL.

The Ottoman delegation was led by Foreign Minister Mehmed Talat Bey, assisted by Naval Minister Çürüksulu Mahmud Pasha and Halil Bey. Although Russia tried to intervene throughout August to prevent Edirne from becoming Turkish again, Toshev told the Ottomans at Constantinople that \\"he Russians consider Constantinople their natural inheritance. Their main concern is that when Constantinople falls into their hands it shall have the largest possible hinterland. If Adrianople is in the possession of the Turks, they shall get it too.\\" Resigned to losing Edirne, the Bulgarians played for Kırk Kilise . Both sides made competing declarations: Savov that \\"Bulgaria, who defeated the Turks on all fronts, cannot end this glorious campaign with the signing of an agreement which retains none of the battlefields on which so much Bulgarian blood has been shed,\\" and Mahmud Pasha that \\"hat we have taken is ours.\\" In the end, none of the battlefields were retained in the Treaty of Constantinople of 30 September.

Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.\\n\\n- The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US$1.\\n\\n- Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.\\n\\n- The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.\\n\\n- Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.\\n\\n- The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.\\n\\n- Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages.\\nThe international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.\\n\\n- Andrew Braybrook is a software engineer, a former game programmer.

It is a shoot 'em up with puzzle elements and was critically appraised at release. The objective is to clear a fleet of spaceships of hostile robots by destroying them or taking them over via a mini-game. It was later remade as \\"Paradroid 90\\" for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers and as Paradroid 2000 for the Acorn Archimedes. There exist several fan-made remakes for modern PCs. In 2004 the Commodore 64 version was re-released as a built-in game on the C64 Direct-to-TV, and in 2008 for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe.\\n\\n- Gribbly 's Day Out is a Commodore 64 game by Andrew Braybrook , released by Hewson in 1985 . It was written over a three - month period .

Rotblat worked on Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project during World War II, but left the Los Alamos Laboratory after the war with Germany ended. His work on nuclear fallout was a major contribution toward the ratification of the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. A signatory of the 1955 Russell-Einstein Manifesto, he was secretary-general of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from their founding until 1973, and shared, with the Pugwash Conferences, the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize \\"for efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.\\"\\nContext: Rotblat returned to Britain to become senior lecturer and acting director of research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With the help of a Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczyslaw (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage of the fact that she was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled the rest of the family out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography.  Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan, and gave a series of public lectures in which he called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research. Rotblat was determined that his research should have only peaceful ends, and so became interested in the medical and biological uses of radiation. In 1949, he became Professor of Physics at St Bartholomew's Hospital (\\"Barts\\"), London, a teaching hospital associated with the University of London. He remained there for the rest of his career, becoming a professor emeritus in 1976. He received his PhD from Liverpool in 1950, having written his thesis on the \\"Determination of a number of neutrons emitted from a source\\". He also worked on several official bodies connected with nuclear physics, and arranged the Atom Train, a major travelling exhibition for schools on civil nuclear energy.  At St Bartholomew's, Rotblat worked on the effects of radiation on living organisms, especially on ageing and fertility. This led him to an interest in nuclear fallout, especially strontium-90 and the safe limits of ionising radiation. In 1955, he demonstrated that the contamination caused by the fallout after the Castle Bravo test at Bikini Atoll nuclear test by the United States would have been far greater than that stated officially. Until then the official line had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released. Japanese scientists who had collected data from a fishing vessel, the Lucky Dragon, which had inadvertently been exposed to fallout, disagreed with this. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase at the end of the explosion increased the amount of radioactivity by forty times. His paper was taken up by the media and contributed to the public debate that resulted in the ending of atmospheric tests by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\\nQuestion: What was his take on nuclear bombs?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan, and gave a series of public lectures in which he called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research.","rationale":"The context mentions that Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan, and gave a series of public lectures in which he called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research. \\nThus, his take was negative towards nuclear bombs."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Intrabodies can alter protein folding, proteinprotein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA interactions and protein modification. They can induce a phenotypic knockout and work as neutralizing agents by direct binding to the target antigen, by diverting its intracellular traffic or by inhibiting its association with binding partners. They have been largely employed as research tools and are emerging as therapeutic molecules for the treatment of human diseases as viral pathologies, cancer and misfolding diseases. The fast growing bio-market of recombinant antibodies provides intrabodies with enhanced binding specificity, stability and solubility, together with lower immunogenicity, for their use in therapy.

The practice of spreading fast food litter and scraps on the street rather than in the dustbin--with young men the worst group--was behind the rise. According to the National Rodent Survey in 2005, Britain's rat population has grown by nearly one quarter since 2000 and is now estimated at 60 million, two million more than the human population. On average a rat can give birth every 24-28 days and just a single pair of rats can produce a family of 2,000 a year.

Comprising approximately 1300 (and possibly up to 2000) member galaxies, the cluster forms the heart of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which the Local Group is an outlying member. However, the Local Group experiences the mass of the Virgo Supercluster as the Virgocentric flow. It is estimated that the Virgo Cluster's mass is 1.2 out to 8 degrees of the cluster's center or a radius of about 2.2 Mpc.\\n\\n- The cosmos is the universe regarded as a complex and orderly system; the opposite of chaos. The philosopher Pythagoras used the term \\"cosmos\\" for the order of the universe, but the term was not part of modern language until the 19th century geographer and polymath, Alexander von Humboldt, resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his multi-volume treatise, \\"Kosmos\\", which influenced our present and somewhat holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity.\\n\\n- A galaxy cluster, or cluster of galaxies, is a structure that consists of anywhere from hundreds to thousands of galaxies that are bound together by gravity with typical masses ranging from 1010 solar masses. They are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe and were believed to be the largest known structures in the universe until the 1980s, when superclusters were discovered. One of the key features of clusters is the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM consists of heated gas between the galaxies and has a peak temperature between 215 keV that is dependent on the total mass of the cluster. Galaxy clusters should not be confused with star clusters, such as open clusters, which are structures of stars \\"within\\" galaxies, or with globular clusters, which typically orbit galaxies. Small aggregates of galaxies are referred to as groups of galaxies rather than clusters of galaxies. The groups and clusters can themselves cluster together to form superclusters.\\n\\n- The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.\\n\\n- The Virgocentric flow (VCF) is the preferred movement of Local Group galaxies towards the Virgo cluster caused by its overwhelming gravity, which separates bound objects from the Hubble flow of cosmic expansion. The VCF can refer to the Local Group's movement towards the Virgo \\"Super\\"cluster, since its center is considered synonymous with the Virgo cluster, but more tedious to ascertain due to its much larger volume. The excess velocity of Local Group galaxies towards, and with respect to, the Virgo Cluster are 100 to 400 km/s. This excess velocity is referred to as each galaxy's peculiar velocity.\\n\\n- The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda.\\n\\n- A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.\\n\\n- A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.\\n\\n- The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy  a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.\\n\\n- Harlow Shapley (November 2, 1885  October 20, 1972) was an American astronomer.\\n\\n- Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889  September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology and is regarded as one of the most important astronomers of all time. \\n\\n- A Supercluster is a large group of smaller galaxy clusters or galaxy groups, which is among the largest-known structures of the cosmos. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group galaxy cluster (that contains more than 54 galaxies), which in turn is part of the Laniakea Supercluster. This supercluster spans over 500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light-years. The number of superclusters in the observable universe is estimated to be 10 million.\\n\\n- The Virgo Supercluster ( Virgo SC ) or the Local Supercluster ( LSC or LS ) is a mass concentration of galaxies that contains the Virgo Cluster in addition to the Local Group , which in turn contains the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies . At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs ( 110 million light - years ) . It is one of millions of superclusters in the observable universe . A 2014 study indicates that the Virgo Supercluster is only a lobe of a greater supercluster , Laniakea , which is centered on the Great Attractor .\\n\\n- Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.\\n\\n- A light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9 trillion kilometres or 6 trillion miles. As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days). Because it includes the word \\"year\\", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time.\\n\\n- The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.\\n\\n- A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names.\\n\\n- The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way. The Local Group comprises more than 54 galaxies, most of them dwarf galaxies. Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell)\\ndistribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'part of' with the subject 'virgo supercluster'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- 19th century\\n - big\\n - celestial sphere\\n - center\\n - earth\\n - eye\\n - galaxy\\n - gravitationally bound system\\n - gravity\\n - language\\n - laniakea supercluster\\n - latin alphabet\\n - local group\\n - march\\n - mass\\n - medium\\n - milky way\\n - morphology\\n - name\\n - november\\n - observable universe\\n - october\\n - orbit\\n - order\\n - part\\n - plasma\\n - september\\n - sky\\n - solar system\\n - supercluster\\n - universe\\n - virgo cluster\\n - virgo supercluster\\n - word\\n - year","target":"laniakea supercluster","rationale":"The Virgo Supercluster is a mass concentration of galaxies that contains the Virgo Cluster in addition to the Local Group, which in turn contains the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies.

This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.","target":"lower","rationale":"Test C shows a forward reaction.

Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero.\\nThat illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data.\\nMy dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy).

Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century.\\nLongacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844.\\nIn Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict.\\nIn 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.  Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic...","target":"Christian Gobrecht","rationale":"In the passage, Christian Gobrecht is mentioned as being preceded by James Barton Longacre.

The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die.

To develop a rational blood pressure target that maximizes the metabolic benefits of resuscitation without causing increased blood loss, it was first necessary to determine whether there is a reproducible mean arterial pressure (MAP) at which rebleeding occurs. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the rate and time of resuscitation after injury and the rebleeding MAP in an uncontrolled hemorrhage model.', \\"Sixty-two anesthetized pigs were instrumented with catheters and splenectomized, and suction tubes were placed in the lateral peritoneal recesses to continuously capture shed blood. With the abdomen open, an aortotomy was made in the infrarenal aorta. At either 5, 15, or 30 minutes after the end of the initial hemorrhage, resuscitation with warmed lactated Ringer's solution was begun at either 100 or 300 mL/min. The rebleeding MAP was determined at the moment blood appeared in the suction tubes.\\", 'The average pressure at the rebleeding point for all animals was MAP = 64 +/- 2, Systolic = 94 +/- 3, and Diastolic = 45 +/- 2 mm Hg.

Kilgore - who oversees delivering legal services to the disabled and elderly in 39 north Mississippi counties - is recipient of the University of Mississippi School of Law's 2002 Public Service Award. The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore's honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \\"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\\" said Davis. \\"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\\" \\"This award means a great deal to me,\\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \\"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\\" After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state. She also is an adjunct professor in the UM law school's Civil Law Clinic. She held a similar post a few years ago in the school's Elder Law Clinic. Kilgore says she's found her niche. \\"I've always thought it was important to do work to help people. I really enjoy it.

These metals exist mainly as insoluble salts; the water-soluble concentration of cobalt and nickel in the cements ranged from 0.39 to 0.65 micrograms/g and from 0-1.2 micrograms/g, respectively. 1.5% (4/272) of construction workers in a prefabrication construction factory had cobalt sensitivity. All had allergic contact dermatitis from chromate in cement. No worker had isolated cobalt sensitivity and cement dermatitis. It appeared that sensitization to cobalt in cement occurs only secondarily to an existing cement dermatitis. 1.8% (5/272) workers had nickel sensitivity: 2 with allergic contact dermatitis to nickel in their watches, 2 were asymptomatic and 1 had allergic contact dermatitis to chromate and cobalt in cement.

There were/are super loud (thinking stomping loudly, throwing stuff, banging cupboards shut) at all hours of the day and night. They're new parents so they have an odd sleeping schedule. I learned very, very quickly that they were very loud around 6-8 am. There kitchen and bathroom is directly overhead so they'd wake me up and keep me up until they were done their breakfast and morning routines. After a few days of this I went up there around 8 (I know, it's not that early but I'm a student and normally sleep from 3-11) and asked them to please be a but quieter because it's an old building and the sound radiates. The guy told me they couldn't be quieter because they had a baby and then shut the door in my face. I went to the landlord who told me I was imagining how loud the noise was. I tried ear plugs but they wouldn't block hot the stomping so I bought a white noise machine. This was an expensive machine and not in my budget but I need sleep. Anyway, apparently they can hear EVERYTHING from my bedroom (which is super embarrassing) and instead of talking to me to resolve the noise they just got louder and louder, meaning I'd turn my noise up higher to cover them. I didn't know they could hear anything until one day it was super quiet and I learned that had left to stay at a friends.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIMO this all could have been avoided if the family had been apologetic and a bit accommodating. They could have put carpets down, walked quieter in the morning, etc. Honestly, they could have come to me the first day after I had woken up and explained the noise was loud and we could have discussed and worked something out. Now it looks like they spend all their time banging, slamming and stomping so I end up playing my music even louder to cover it so I can sleep/study. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have no idea if the noise bothers anyone else, and it looks like the landlord is going to try to fix the noise going UP to them but not their stomping or slamming coming DOWN to me.

He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish.\\n\\nJonah is regarded as a saint by a number of Christian denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the Martyrologium Romanum. In Catholicism, the Book of Jonah is also read aloud in its entirety on Maundy Thursday in a Beneventan chant. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern Gregorian calendar). In the Armenian Apostolic Church, moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the Fast of Nineveh in Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church on 22 September.  Christian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ. Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus's crucifixion and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for Jesus's resurrection. Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus's more nationalistic side, and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that \\"Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people.\\"  Other Christian interpreters, including Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, have taken a directly opposite approach, regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people. Luther likewise concludes that the kikayon represents Judaism, and that the worm which devours it represents Christ. Luther's antisemitic interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history. J. D. Michaelis comments that \\"the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes\\", and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against \\"the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth.\\" Albert Eichhorn was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.  John Calvin and John Hooper regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God. While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah, Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt. Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of Hell, intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness. Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story, describing the sailors on the boat as \\"hard and iron-hearted, like Cyclops\\", the penitence of the Ninevites as \\"untrained\\", and the king of Nineveh as a \\"novice\\". Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the archetypal dissident and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state. Hooper deplores such dissidents, decrying: \\"Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!\\"\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Jonah","rationale":"The entire text is about the life of Jonah.

Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.

It was waged between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice, the latter joined by the Holy League, a coalition of Christian states formed under the auspices of the Pope, which included Spain , the Republic of Genoa, the Duchy of Savoy, the Knights Hospitaller, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and other Italian states. The war, the pre-eminent episode of Sultan Selim II's reign, began with the Ottoman invasion of the Venetian-held island of Cyprus. The capital Nicosia and several other towns fell quickly to the considerably superior Ottoman army, leaving only Famagusta in Venetian hands.

Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, but was unable to take advantage of this victory.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the source of this variability and to determine which ordering principles remained operative in REM sleep. In unrestrained, naturally sleeping cats we recorded the electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, neck electromyogram, and diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) and computed its moving average (MAdi). As a reference, we first examined MAdi during \\"tonic\\" REMS, since breathing is fairly regular in this state. \\"Control\\" ranges for peak amplitude (PEMG), inspiratory time (TI), duration of postinspiratory inspiratory activity, expiratory time, and the calculated inspiratory slope (PEMG/TI) were determined by overlaying individual breath traces of the time course of MAdi during tonic REMS to form a composite tracing. Next, the time course of the EMG during individual breaths in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and a complete period of consecutive breaths in REMS (both tonic and phasic) were compared with this tonic REMS composite. The number of eye movements per breath was tabulated as an index of phasic activity. The inspiratory slopes during SWS and tonic REMS were similar. However, during phasic REMS, many breaths displayed either increases (excitation) or decreases (inhibition) in slope compared with the \\"typical\\" breaths seen in tonic REMS. The occurrence of these altered slopes increased with the frequency of phasic events. TI was inversely related to the slope of the EMG, which tended to minimize changes in PEMG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","target":"Animal","rationale":"The abstract mentions the use of cats as subjects in the experiment, so \\"Animal\\" is a good keyword."},{"source":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who is accused of being a devil?\\n\\nSet in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results.

With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles.\\nLaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue.\\nThe group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil.

LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest.

These defenders are the left fielder, the center fielder, and the right fielder. An outfielder's duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Outfielders normally play behind the six other members of the defense who play in or near the infield.\\n\\n- Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'vicki morrow' with the relationship of 'occupation'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- administrator\\n - association football\\n - canada\\n - cook\\n - faculty\\n - game\\n - general\\n - major\\n - member\\n - prior\\n - relief pitcher\\n - research\\n - rutgers university\\n - softball player\\n - soldier\\n - university of michigan","target":"softball player","rationale":"Vicki Morrow is a former softball player and outfielder who played for the University of Michigan Wolverines softball team from 1983 to 1987.

For example, in forming an impression of a new boss you would probably be affected to a much greater degree by how this person gives you orders (whether respectfully or not) than by the color1 of his or her eyes.

L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building.

Last night my friend and I were at this cafe/bar/restaurant that had s jazz band playing. The place is new and it was my first time there. It's described on its website as a place that \\"combines classy and affordable craft cocktails and pizza, in a setting welcoming to all.\\". They also host live jazz, hip hop and DJs in the evening a few nights a week. It's a tiny place with maybe 12 tables and a few bar seats and tall bar tables. The whole place holds maybe 60 people.  There is no real stage, just a clearing for the band.\\n\\nWe got there late and sat at the bar which is to the side of where they had set up the band. Most people were focused on the music but some of the tables had people chatting through the evening. Many people eating dinner everyone drinking. So my friend and I are chatting, loud enough to hear each other because the music was loud but trying to be quiet enough so as not to disturb those around us. \\n\\nThe band is instrumental jazz, much of it kinda rocking. But then they get to this quiet slow piece and towards the end the guy next to us leans over and said \\"nobody else is talking. can you guys stop talking just during this song?\\" We did stop talking and the song ended like 10 seconds later.\\n\\nThe place was a cafe with a band placed at a clearing in the corner. This wasnt a theater or even a real music venue. This wasnt a ticketed concert although there was $5 cover at the door.  They serve a full dinner menu. \\n\\nWas I the asshole for talking while the band was playing a quiet piece? Again we were talking quietly, but the guy right next to us could probably hear us.

The author complied with the man's request, but felt irritated by it because they were at an establishment where food and drinks were served, not a theater or concert venue.\\\\nIn this case, neither party is wrong because while it is reasonable for the author and their friend to talk quietly without disturbing others during an event at a restaurant/bar setting, it is also reasonable for someone who wants to listen attentively without any distractions like talking from nearby people or patrons walking in front of them (especially if there wasn't much space).

Passage 1:Aegae or Aigai (), also Aegeae or Aigeai (Αἰγέαι), was a city in Emathia in ancient Macedonia, and the burial-place of the Macedonian kings. The commanding and picturesque site upon which the town was built was the original centre of the Macedonians, and the residence of the dynasty which sprang from the Temenid Perdiccas. The seat of government was afterwards transferred to the marshes of Pella, which lay in the maritime plain beneath the ridge through which the Lydias forces its way to the sea. But the old capital always remained the national hearth (ἑστία, Diod. Excerpt. p. 563) of the Macedonian race, and the burial-place for their kings. The body of Alexander the Great, though by the intrigues of Ptolemy I Soter, it was taken to Memphis, was to have reposed at Aegae, – the spot where his father Philip II of Macedon fell by the hand of Pausanias of Orestis.\\n Passage 2:He was selected as Sepahan's assistant coach in 2006 by Luka Bonačić.

He was selected Ghanbari as his first team assistant coach which was worked with him until his dismissal in February 2009. After he expired his contract with Al-Nasr, he became assistant manager of Sepahan for a second time under management of Amir Ghalenoei. He continue his career with Sepahan after Ghalenoie's resignation in 2011. Bonačić was appointed as Sepahan head coach for a second tensure and Ghanbari was one of his assistants. On 14 August 2011 and after Bonačić was sacked by club due to bad results, Ghanbari became caretaker manager of Sepahan.

The maple leaf was later added to the Canadian coat of arms in 1921. From 1876 until 1901, the leaf appeared on all Canadian coins and remained on the penny after 1901. The use of the maple leaf by the Royal Canadian Regiment as a regimental symbol extended back to 1860.

Funeral celebrations lasted three days, from 26 to 28 January 2013, and took place in three major churches of Warsaw. On Saturday, 26 January, the cardinal's body was lying in state in the Visitationist Church. On Sunday, the coffin was moved to the Church of the Holy Cross, where a Holy Mass was celebrated by Archbishop Celestino Migliore, the apostolic nuncio to Poland, with the sermon preached by Archbishop Józef Michalik, the head of the Polish Conference of Bishops. After the mass, a funeral procession took the coffin to St. John's Cathedral. The Monday, 28 January 2013 Funeral Mass was attended by president Bronisław Komorowski and his wife Anna, former president Lech Wałęsa, former prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, representatives from the judiciary, the Senate, and the Sejm, and other high-ranking officials from various institutions. Over a hundred prelates from Poland and abroad (among them, Prague's Cardinal Dominik Duka, Budapest's Cardinal Peter Erdo, Barcelona's Cardinal Lluis Martinez Sistach, Cologne's Cardinal Joachim Meisner, and Zagreb's Cardinal Josip Bozanić) concelebrated, with Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, the Archbishop of Kraków, presiding. The homily was given by the Archbishop of Gniezno, Józef Kowalczyk, the incumbent Primate of Poland. Afterwards, the late primate was entombed in a crypt of the Cathedral.\\n Passage 2:Garvagh was the son of Paul Canning and the grandson of Stratford Canning of Garvagh in County Londonderry. Prime Minister George Canning and the diplomat Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, were his first cousins. He was elected to the House of Commons for Sligo Borough in 1806, a seat he held until 1812, and then represented Petersfield from 1812 to 1820. On 1 February 1810 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and on 28 October 1818 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Garvagh, of Garvagh in the County of Londonderry. Lord Garvagh later served as Lord Lieutenant of County Londonderry between 1831 and 1840. He died while staying at a hotel in Châlons-sur-Marne (now renamed Châlons-en-Champagne) in August 1840, aged 61, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Charles Henry Spencer George Canning.\\n Passage 3:Granite Canyon is located in Grand Teton National Park, in the U. S. state of Wyoming. The canyon was formed by glaciers which retreated at the end of the last glacial maximum approximately 15,000 years ago, leaving behind a U-shaped valley. The canyon lies between Rendezvous Mountain to the south and Mount Hunt to the north. The trailhead for the canyon is on the Moose–Wilson Road about north of Teton Village. One of the most popular hikes from the trailhead is to Marion Lake by way of the Granite Canyon Trail which traverses the length of the canyon. Another popular hike involves riding the aerial tram located at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Teton Village to the top of Rendezvous Mountain, and then descending back to Teton Village by way of Granite Canyon.

The two teams traded field goals in the first quarter, with a 32-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Matt Prater and a 45-yarder by Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock. The Broncos grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. A 35-yard field goal by Bullock narrowed the Broncos' lead, but the Broncos increased it with two field goals from Prater in the final minute of the first half &#8212; a 25-yarder and a 44-yarder. A 15-yard touchdown pass from Texans' quarterback Matt Schaub to wide receiver Keshawn Martin was the only scoring play of the third quarter, which narrowed the Broncos' lead to 16-13. After Broncos' safety Mike Adams intercepted Schaub early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos subsequently pulled away, with Manning throwing two touchdown passes to wide receiver Eric Decker &#8212; a 10-yarder and a 20-yarder. Later in the fourth quarter, Manning threw his 51st touchdown pass of the season &#8212; a 25-yarder to tight end Julius Thomas, in which Manning set a new NFL record for touchdown passes in a single season.

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes.

It is sometimes called \\"The Queen of Mathematics\\" because of its foundational place in the discipline. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers).\\n\\n- The abc conjecture ( also known as the Oesterlé -- Masser conjecture ) is a conjecture in number theory , first proposed by Joseph Oesterlé ( 1988 ) and David Masser ( 1985 ) . It is stated in terms of three positive integers , a , b and c ( hence the name ) that are relatively prime and satisfy a + b = c. If d denotes the product of the distinct prime factors of abc , the conjecture essentially states that d is usually not much smaller than c. In other words : if a and b are composed from large powers of primes , then c is usually not divisible by large powers of primes . The precise statement is given below . The abc conjecture has already become well known for the number of interesting consequences it entails . Many famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the abc conjecture . Goldfeld ( 1996 ) described the abc conjecture as \`\` the most important unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis '' . Several solutions have been proposed to the abc conjecture , the most recent of which is still being evaluated by the mathematical community .\\n\\n- A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.\\n\\n- In Algebraic number theory, an algebraic integer is a complex number that is a root of some monic polynomial (a polynomial whose leading coefficient is 1) with coefficients in formula_1 (the set of integers). The set of all algebraic integers, , is closed under addition and multiplication and therefore is a commutative subring of the complex numbers.

You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement.

The \\"Kriegsmarine\\" was one of three official branchesalong with the \\"Heer (Army)\\" and the \\"Luftwaffe (Air Force)\\"of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany.\\n\\n- The 1st Marine Infantrie - Division was formed in February 1945 in Stettin from Marine - Schützen - Brigade Nord . Replacement troops were provided by 1.Marine - Infanterie - Ersatz und Ausbildungs - Bataillon located in Lübberstedt bei Wesermünde . Activated from Kriegsmarine forces it was active in north west Germany against Allied forces until the end of the war .\\n\\n- World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.\\n\\n- A navy or maritime force is a fleet of waterborne military vessels (watercraft) and its associated naval aviation, both sea-based and land-based. It is the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne combat operations and related functions. It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields; recent developments have included space-related operations. The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of Submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Naval operations can be broadly divided between riverine and littoral applications (brown-water navy), open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), and something in between (green-water navy), although these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division.\\n\\n- The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.\\n\\n- The Reichsmarine (\\"Navy of the Realm\\") was the name of the German Navy during the Weimar Republic and first two years of Nazi Germany.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.\\n\\n- The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.\\n\\n\\n\\n'1st naval infantry division ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'part of'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1914\\n - 1943\\n - armed forces\\n - army\\n - division\\n - english\\n - german\\n - military\\n - name\\n - naval aviation\\n - navy\\n - november\\n - ocean\\n - reichswehr\\n - sea\\n - state\\n - war\\n - warfare\\n - watercraft\\n - wehrmacht\\n - world war ii","target":"wehrmacht","rationale":"The 1st Marine infantry division was formed in February 1945.

Jericho competed in a Triple Threat match against Chris Benoit and Angle at WrestleMania 2000 in a two-falls contest with both of Angle's titles at stake. Jericho won the European Championship by pinning Benoit, who in turn pinned Jericho to win the Intercontinental Championship. This was the first of six pay-per-view matches between the pair within twelve months. Jericho was originally supposed to be in the main event of WrestleMania, but was taken out after Mick Foley, who was originally asked by writers to be in the match, took his place. Jericho was even advertised on the event's posters promoting the match. Jericho lost the title the next day to Eddie Guerrero on Raw after Chyna turned heel to side with Guerrero.  On the April 17 episode of Raw, Jericho upset Triple H in a WWF Championship match. Referee Earl Hebner made a fast count when Jericho pinned Triple H, causing Jericho to win the title. Hebner later reversed the decision due to pressure from Triple H, and WWE does not recognize Jericho's reign as champion. On the May 4 episode of SmackDown!, Jericho defeated Benoit to win his third Intercontinental Championship but lost the title to Benoit four days later on Raw. Jericho's feud with Triple H ended at Fully Loaded, when they competed in a Last Man Standing match. Jericho lost the match to Triple H only by one second, despite the repeated assistance Triple H's wife, Stephanie, provided him in the match.

Benoit and Jericho won the match, in which Triple H legitimately tore his quadriceps, spending the rest of the year injured. Benoit and Jericho each became a WWF Tag Team Champion for the first time. The team defended their title in the first fatal four-way Tables, Ladders and Chairs match, where Benoit sustained a year-long injury after missing a diving headbutt through a table. Despite Benoit being carried out on a stretcher, he returned to the match to climb the ladder and retain the championship. The two lost the title one month later to The Dudley Boyz on June 19, 2001. At King of the Ring, both Benoit and Jericho competed in a triple threat match for Austin's WWF Championship, in which Booker T interfered as the catalyst for The Invasion angle. Despite Booker T's interference, Austin retained the title.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: who was the all over winner?","target":"At the 2001 Royal Rumble, Jericho defeated Chris Benoit in a ladder match to win the Intercontinental Championship for the fourth time.","rationale":"Therefore, the best answer to this question would be: At the 2001 Royal Rumble, Jericho defeated Chris Benoit in a ladder match to win the Intercontinental Championship for the fourth time."}]`),H={components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{poemsData:W,visibleCount:6,isLoading:!1}},computed:{hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],N={key:0},E={key:1};function R(o,e,c,m,i,s){const r=v("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Chain of Thought 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[d(r,{poems:i.poemsData},null,8,["poems"])]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),n("span",E,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",N,"See more"))],8,P)):k("",!0)])}const D=u(H,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-f17243ca"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/13.md","filePath":"guide/13.md"}'),O={name:"guide/13.md"},G=Object.assign(O,{setup(o){return(e,c)=>(a(),n("div",null,[d(D)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
