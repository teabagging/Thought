In some older systems of classification, Zoomastigophora is a phylum (more commonly known as zooflagellates) within the kingdom Protista. Organisms within this group have a spherical, elongated body with a single central nucleus. Zooflagellates have one or more flagella but do not have plastids or cell walls. A few are mutualistic, such as those that live in the guts of termites and aid the bacteria present in breaking down wood.

The white sands, imported from the far west mountains of limestone, sucked up the fire of the huge red sun. It was always hot in the south desert. Even in the deep of night the stones of Gazu Kadem kept the city warm. Now, at mid-day, it was at its hottest. A quarter of a million people at the arena didn't make it any cooler. The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed. His soldiers watched the games in silence. They made not a sound when twelve of the most beautiful girls to walk on small bare feet were raped and flayed apart by dark priests in a ritual to Gazu Kadem's god-king, Danken Ovelde. They studied the three-horned desert bull as it gored five slaves. They watched the spear technique of four slave armies as they warred in a single great battle.

The series also examines the personal lives of the couple, delving into their relationships with their children, and with each other. The marriage between George and Mary was an arranged marriage, occurring only because Prince Albert Victor, George's brother and Mary's original fiancé, died from influenza.

The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town.\\nA man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass.\\nThe posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson.\\nLater that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise.\\nMartin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die.","target":"Carter","rationale":"The context describes Rose as Gil's ex-girlfriend. Her husband, Swanson, is later mentioned in the same paragraph. As a result, it can be inferred that her last name (before marrying) was Carter because she shares a surname with Gil Carter - the first man who entered Darby's saloon at the beginning of this passage.\\nSo the answer to \\"What is the last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend?\\" would be Carter"},{"source":"Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are Solution #2 or Solution #1 ):\\n\\nThe more basic a solution is, the closer its pH value will be to 14.\\n\\n\\nTanya was measuring pH values and recorded a value of 13 for Solution #1.

The group consists of founders Dave Gahan (lead vocals, co-songwriting), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, chief songwriting), and Andy Fletcher (keyboards). Depeche Mode released their debut album Speak & Spell in 1981, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Original band member Vince Clarke, left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record A Broken Frame, released the following year.\\n\\nDuring the touring and promotion for Speak & Spell, Clarke privately began to voice his discomfort at the direction the band was taking. He later expressed his dissatisfaction, saying \\"there was never enough time to do anything. Not with all the interviews and photo sessions\\". In November 1981, Clarke publicly announced that he was leaving Depeche Mode. It was also claimed that Clarke was sick of touring, which Gahan said years later was \\"bullshit to be quite honest\\". Gahan went on to say he \\"suddenly lost interest in it and he started getting letters from fans asking what kind of socks he wore\\".  Soon afterwards, Clarke joined up with blues singer Alison Moyet to form Yazoo (or Yaz in the United States). Initial talk of Clarke's continuing to write material for Depeche Mode ultimately amounted to nothing. According to third-party sources, Clarke offered the remaining members of Depeche Mode the track \\"Only You\\", but they declined. Clarke, however, denied in an interview that such an offer ever took place saying, \\"I don't know where that came from. That's not true.\\" The song went on to become a UK Top 3 hit for Yazoo. Gore, who had written \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" and the instrumental \\"Big Muff\\" for Speak & Spell, became the band's main lyricist.  In late 1981, the band placed an anonymous ad in Melody Maker looking for another musician: \\"Name band, synthesise, must be under twenty-one.\\" Alan Wilder, a classically trained keyboardist from West London, responded and, after two auditions and despite being 22 years old, was hired in early 1982, initially on a trial basis as a touring member. Wilder would later be called the \\"Musical Director\\" of the band, responsible for the band's sound until his departure in 1995. As producer Flood would say, \\"[Alan] is sort of the craftsman, Martin's the idea man and [Dave] is the attitude.\\"  In January 1982, the band released \\"See You\\", their first single without Clarke, which managed to beat all three Clarke-penned singles in the UK charts, reaching number six. The following tour saw the band playing their first shows in North America. Two more singles, \\"The Meaning of Love\\" and \\"Leave in Silence,\\" were released ahead of the band's second studio album, on which they began work in July 1982. Daniel Miller informed Wilder that he was not needed for the recording of the album, as the core trio wanted to prove they could succeed without Vince Clarke. A Broken Frame was released that September, and the following month the band began their 1982 tour. A non-album single, \\"Get the Balance Right!,\\" was released in January 1983, the first Depeche Mode track to be recorded with Wilder.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"How did they find Wilder?","rationale":"The article talks about Alan Wilder, a classically trained keyboardist from West London who was hired by the band in 1982.

Similarly for the blue balls: 30% are tennis balls so y is 30% of y or 0.3y (since 30%, or 0.3, multiplied by any quantity equals that quantity multiplied by 0.3).

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, $8,033/ha and $13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.","target":"Tibet","rationale":"Nepal put nature and biodiversity first, while Tibet experienced carbon and nitrogen loss.

The Patriots' next drive went for 71 yards and ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal to build the Patriots' lead to 19-10. This would be the final score, as the Jets' next drive, which included a 20-yard sack of Favre by Adalius Thomas, went three-and-out and the Patriots held the ball for the final 3:45 in the game. The win brought the Patriots' record to 2-0 and kept the team tied for first place in the AFC East. Gostkowski finished the day 4-for-4 on field goals and earned five touchbacks on six kickoffs.\\n\\nQuestion: Who scored the most field goals?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Gostkowski","rationale":"We know from the text that Gostkowski finished 4 for 4 on field goals, compared to 21 yards and 28 yards of other kickers.

To this end, his daughter, the princess Gilda (Mary Ainslee), threatens to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive Number 13 pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. The fictitious country of Moronica seems to be familiar with a pool game in which the 13 ball is placed at the head of the rack during set up.[1]\\nDictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Field Marshal Herring (Curly) and Minister of Propaganda (Larry) for a turkey (a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey.

College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it?\\nSeveral studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families.\\nFirst, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \\"high price\\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs.\\nOther factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants  to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree.\\nAt the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \\"subsidize  \\" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities.\\nThis puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more.\\nTherefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \\"college in the end.\\nQuestion: It can be inferred that in America   _  .\\nYes or no, is the answer \\"famous colleges charge their students more money\\"?","target":"No","rationale":"The article mentions that many colleges have the belief that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge more. This is similar to famous companies charging their customers higher prices, as seen in this sentence: \\"This puts upward pressure on tuition\\". But it does not mean that famous colleges do charge their students more money.\\nTherefore, in America there are some college which has a strong fame and charges lower or equal amount of fees than other less-known colleges; so the answer is No."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- A business model is an \\"abstract representation of an organization, be it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical, of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organization offers, or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives.\\" This definition by Al-Debei, El-Haddadeh and Avison (2008) indicates that value proposition, value architecture (the organizational infrastructure and technological architecture that allows the movement of products, services, and information), value finance (modeling information related to total cost of ownership, pricing methods, and revenue structure), and value network articulate the primary constructs or dimensions of business models.\\n\\n- Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as \\"the stakes\\") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning money and/or material goods. Gambling thus requires three elements be present: consideration, chance and prize. The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.\\n\\n- Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning \\"little wheel\\". In the game, players may choose to place bets on either a single number or a range of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number is odd or even.\\n\\n- Vegas Dream , released in Japan as Viva ! Las Vegas (   ) is a gambling video game produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System and developed by HAL Laboratory that was released in 1988 .\\n\\n- MSX is the name of a standardized home computer architecture, first announced by Microsoft on June 16, 1983, and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then Vice-president at Microsoft Japan and Director at ASCII Corporation. Microsoft conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various hardware makers of the period.\\n\\n- A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form (the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people). When the input information is supplied has an electrical signal, the display is called an \\"electronic display\\".\\n\\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\\n\\n- The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo.\\nThe best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform.\\n\\n- IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind. It was launched March 25, 2000 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB and ceased operations in December 2005.\\n\\n- The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.\\n\\n- Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money.\\n\\n- HAL Laboratory started off making games for the MSX system and the Commodore VIC-20.\\n\\n- The concept of video games as a form of art is a controversial topic within the entertainment industry. Though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the Supreme Court of the United States, the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even art games, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.\\n\\n- Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.\\n\\n- An electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games).\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'vegas dream' and 'casino game'?","target":"genre","rationale":"Vegas Dream is a computer game that falls into the genre of casino games.\\nA business model describes an organization, while gambling and roulette are topics related to casinos or betting in general.

However, these display technologies played only a small role in Vegas Dream's overall success as it was primarily sold on physical media such as cartridges for use with Nintendo Entertainment System consoles whose controllers did not feature touchscreen technology like today's iPad tablets do nor analog sticks like modern day Xbox 360 controller does but rather featured directional"},{"source":"Sentence: shoe can be worn on feet that are bigger than the shoe\\nIf the sentence does not make sense, correct it so that it does make sense.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.\\n\\nParagraph: Mike is studying the predator prey relationship. He is specifically studying three species, species A, species B, and species C. Species A is a predator; species B is the prey; and species C is a plant species that species B lives on. Mike now needs to figure out how the predator prey relationship balance the ecosystem.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If species A population increase, would species C population increase or decrease?","target":"increase","rationale":"The context suggests that species A is a predator, and preys on species B. If the population of predators increases in an ecosystem, then we would expect to see a decrease in prey populations. This could result in more food for remaining plants or other producers as well as less competition from herbivores.\\n\\nSo based on this information, it can be inferred that if Species A's population increased, then its prey (species B) will also experience decreased numbers with fewer individuals competing for resources such as plant life like species C . As a result of these factors , there may be an increase in the number of available nutrients for existing organisms including those used by plants like species C which leads to their own population increasing ."},{"source":"In this task you will be given an answer to a question.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a $250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island.

Inflammation in middle ear disease is related to ET dysfunction, and postoperative restoration of middle ear integrity and hearing are closely related to ET function in chronic ear disease patients.

In this study, we evaluated the predictive validity of preoperative ET function measurements.', 'We reviewed 137 patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty. All patients had non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media and received canal wall-up-type tympanomastoidectomies.

Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano:\\nI decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did.\\nDespite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".\\n\\nGuess a valid title for it!","target":"Pierre Monteux","rationale":"This passage is about the life of Pierre Monteux, a French conductor. \\nThe context provides details relating to his career as a conductor and mentions two different works he conducted: Jeux by Debussy and Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.

Therefore, it can be inferred that this individual had professional experience as either an orchestra member (violinist) or conductor; however, none of these professions are mentioned in the text.

By doing this, you (and your customer) will receive the tracking information ASAP. Because PayPal won’t release the payment hold until the buyer rates and reviews you, this may be the best way to ensure you get your money in a timely manner. If, however, the package is lost in the mail (or the buyer is unresponsive) PayPal will automatically release your payment hold after 21 days. Unless, of course, the buyer is disputing your store and claiming you sold them junk. This will result in a loss of money, as well as endless amounts of stress. I sold several items with a new ebay and paypal account, all for less than $5. each, and paypal put the 21 day hold on me. I stopped using ebay about 5 years ago after my divorce, and i needed a new account and a new payupal account to sell on ebay. The Keys to Surviving the PayPal 21-Day Hold Policy. The “21 Day Hold Paypal Policy” has created a great deal of frustration for many eBay sellers. Below I have some recommendations for eBay sellers who are looking to ease the pain of this new policy: While everyone is at risk of a PayPal payment hold, there are ways to ensure that it doesn’t happen to you. Or, if it does, it won’t be often enough to bother you (or your business). Let’s talk about some of the ways you can avoid payment holds in the future. eBay sellers who are relatively new (less than 100 feedback or member less than 6 months) or who have had little activity in the last year (fewer than 20 DSRs in the last 12 months) are, therefore, automatically subjected to the PayPal 21-Day hold even if their buyer satisfaction rating is greater than 95%. Keep in mind these few tips to ensure you’ll be free of payment holds after a while: 1  Stay consistent with your customers. 2  Keep your DSRs around 4-5. 3  Don’t change up your store too fast. 4  Print your labels directly from eBay (if you’re selling there) and always enter your tracking number. Still not sure why PayPal has placed your payment on hold? Here are a few reasons to be on the lookout for: You’re new to eBay. If you’re not a valid seller and haven’t sold more than a few items, PayPal will put your payment on hold to make sure you’re delivering the item(s) in a timely manner. Whether you’re new to eBay or not, PayPal holds will affect you all the same. While this may send you into a pit of despair at first, these holds won’t last longer than 21 days. In fact, your payment may not even be on hold for that long! Payment holds can be lifted as the status of the shipped item is updated. Meaning: when your package is marked “shipped” and a tracking number is provided, the hold will be taken away. (If anything, the payment hold will be lifted when the buyer leaves feedback for you). Being a top-rated seller on eBay will come in handy in more ways than one. 1  A few ways to get to the top of eBay’s seller list include: 2  Being an eBay seller for more than 6-12 months. 3  Above 95% feedback score. 4  Less than 20 DSRs (Detailed seller ratings) within 12 months.

He is the son of Carol (nee Lutz) and Warren Elliott Norquist (a vice president of Polaroid Corporation), and is of Swedish ancestry. His brother, David Norquist has served in senior posts in Republican administrations at both the United States Department of Defense and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Norquist became involved with politics at an early age when he volunteered for the 1968 Nixon campaign, assisting with get out the vote efforts.\\nContext: Prior to the November 2012 election, 238 of 242 House Republicans and 41 out of 47 Senate Republicans had signed ATR's \\"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\\", in which the pledger promises to \\"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rate for individuals and business; and to oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\\"  The November 6, 2012 elections resulted in a decline in the number of Taxpayer Protection Pledge signatories in both the upper and lower houses of the 113th Congress: from 41 to 39 in the Senate, and from 238 to \\"fewer than ... 218\\" in the House of Representatives. According to journalist Alex Seitz-Wald, losses in the election by Norquist supporters and the \\"fiscal cliff\\" have emboldened and made more vocal critics of Norquist.  In November 2011, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) blamed Norquist's influence for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction's lack of progress, claiming that Congressional Republicans \\"are being led like puppets by Grover Norquist. They're giving speeches that we should compromise on our deficit, but never do they compromise on Grover Norquist. He is their leader.\\" Since Norquist's pledge binds signatories to opposing deficit reduction agreements that include any element of increased tax revenue, some Republican deficit hawks now retired from office have stated that Norquist has become an obstacle to deficit reduction. Former Republican Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), co-chairman of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, has been particularly critical, describing Norquist's position as \\"[n]o taxes, under any situation, even if your country goes to hell.\\"\\nQuestion: Who passed the pledge?.

He held the James Bryant Conant University Professorship at Harvard University and the Fulbright Fellowship at the University of Oxford. Rawls received both the Schock Prize for Logic and Philosophy and the National Humanities Medal in 1999, the latter presented by President Bill Clinton, in recognition of how Rawls's work \\"helped a whole generation of learned Americans revive their faith in democracy itself.\\" In his 1990 introduction to the field, Will Kymlicka wrote that \\"it is generally accepted that the recent rebirth of normative political philosophy began with the publication of John Rawls's A Theory of Justice in 1971.\\"\\n\\nRawls derives two principles of justice from the original position. The first of these is the Liberty Principle, which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens. 'Basic' liberty entails the (familiar in the liberal tradition) freedoms of conscience, association and expression as well as democratic rights; Rawls also includes a personal property right, but this is defended in terms of moral capacities and self-respect, rather than an appeal to a natural right of self-ownership (this distinguishes Rawls's account from the classical liberalism of John Locke and the libertarianism of Robert Nozick).  Rawls argues that a second principle of equality would be agreed upon to guarantee liberties that represent meaningful options for all in society and ensure distributive justice. For example, formal guarantees of political voice and freedom of assembly are of little real worth to the desperately poor and marginalized in society. Demanding that everyone have exactly the same effective opportunities in life would almost certainly offend the very liberties that are supposedly being equalized. Nonetheless, we would want to ensure at least the \\"fair worth\\" of our liberties: wherever one ends up in society, one wants life to be worth living, with enough effective freedom to pursue personal goals. Thus participants would be moved to affirm a two-part second principle comprising Fair Equality of Opportunity and the famous (and controversial) difference principle. This second principle ensures that those with comparable talents and motivation face roughly similar life chances and that inequalities in society work to the benefit of the least advantaged.  Rawls held that these principles of justice apply to the \\"basic structure\\" of fundamental social institutions (such as the judiciary, the economic structure and the political constitution), a qualification that has been the source of some controversy and constructive debate (see the work of Gerald Cohen).  Rawls further argued that these principles were to be 'lexically ordered' to award priority to basic liberties over the more equality-oriented demands of the second principle. This has also been a topic of much debate among moral and political philosophers.  Finally, Rawls took his approach as applying in the first instance to what he called a \\"well-ordered society ... designed to advance the good of its members and effectively regulated by a public conception of justice\\". In this respect, he understood justice as fairness as a contribution to \\"ideal theory\\", the determination of \\"principles that characterize a well-ordered society under favorable circumstances\\". Much recent work in political philosophy has asked what justice as fairness might dictate (or indeed, whether it is very useful at all) for problems of \\"partial compliance\\" under \\"nonideal theory\\".\\n\\nWhat is the difference principle?","target":"those with comparable talents and motivation face roughly similar life chances and that inequalities in society work to the benefit of the least advantaged.","rationale":"The difference principle is the second part of a two-part second principle.

On arrival in Europe the Baron rejoined the German army, and was killed at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, just two weeks after signing up. His wife could not bring herself to return to Namibia alone and never again laid claim to the majestic castle. She stayed on the coast of the Tegernmeer in Bavaria (since her stepfather had been appointed consul general in Munich), before settling in the late 1930s in Zurich, where she met and married Erich Schlemmer, the consul general of Siam. After the Von Wolfs left South Africa, their friend Max Count von Lüttichau was given executorship of the farm, but it declared bankruptcy shortly after World War I, and since the South African government paid no compensation for this or several wartime raids, the house was sold for £7,500 to the Swedish Murrmann family. The new owner died shortly after his arrival and his son was killed in World War II, following which the castle was sold for 25,000 pounds to the private company Duwisib Pty Ltd and the rest of the land was divided and sold off. Jayta returned to the US to stay with her parents in Summit, New Jersey.

Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows.

Throughout his life, Godel would remain close to his mother; their correspondence was frequent and wide-ranging. At the time of his birth the city had a German-speaking majority which included his parents. His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised Protestant. The ancestors of Kurt Godel were often active in Brunn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph Godel was a famous singer of that time and for some years a member of the \\"Brunner Mannergesangverein\\".  Godel automatically became a Czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up at the end of World War I. According to his classmate Klepetar, like many residents of the predominantly German Sudetenlander, \\"Godel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia\\". He chose to become an Austrian citizen at age 23. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Godel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. After World War II, at the age of 42, he became an American citizen.  In his family, young Kurt was known as Herr Warum (\\"Mr. Why\\") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, Godel suffered from \\"frequent episodes of poor health,\\" which would continue for his entire life.  Godel attended the Evangelische Volksschule, a Lutheran school in Brunn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for Vienna to go to medical school at the University of Vienna. During his teens, Kurt studied Gabelsberger shorthand, Goethe's Theory of Colours and criticisms of Isaac Newton, and the writings of Immanuel Kant.\\nQuestion: What were his interests?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics.","rationale":"The context states that Kurt first excelled in languages and then became more interested in history, mathematics.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

Koolhaas studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London and at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Koolhaas is the founding partner of OMA, and of its research-oriented counterpart AMO based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In 2005, he co-founded Volume Magazine together with Mark Wigley and Ole Bouman.\\n\\nKoolhaas's next landmark publications were a product of his position as professor at Harvard University, in the Design school's \\"Project on the City\\"; firstly the 720-page Mutations, followed by The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping (2002) and The Great Leap Forward (2002). All three books involved Koolhaas's students analysing what others would regard as \\"non-cities\\", sprawling conglomerates such as Lagos in Nigeria, west Africa, which the authors argue are highly functional despite a lack of infrastructure. The authors also examine the influence of shopping habits and the recent rapid growth of cities in China. Critics of the books have criticised Koolhaas for being cynical - as if Western capitalism and globalization demolish all cultural identity - highlighted in the notion expounded in the books that \\"In the end, there will be little else for us to do but shop\\". However, such cynicism can alternatively be read as a \\"realism\\" about the transformation of cultural life, where airports and even museums (due to finance problems) rely just as much on operating gift shops.  When it comes to transforming these observations into practice, Koolhaas mobilizes what he regards as the omnipotent forces of urbanism into unique design forms and connections organised along the lines of present-day society. Koolhaas continuously incorporates his observations of the contemporary city within his design activities: calling such a condition the 'culture of congestion'. Again, shopping is examined for \\"intellectual comfort\\", whilst the unregulated taste and densification of Chinese cities is analysed according to \\"performance\\", a criterion involving variables with debatable credibility: density, newness, shape, size, money etc. For example, in his design for the new CCTV headquarters in Beijing (2009), Koolhaas did not opt for the stereotypical skyscraper, often used to symbolise and landmark such government enterprises, but instead designed a series of volumes which not only tie together the numerous departments onto the nebulous site, but also introduced routes (again, the concept of cross-programming) for the general public through the site, allowing them some degree of access to the production procedure. Through his ruthlessly raw approach, Koolhaas hopes to extract the architect from the anxiety of a dead profession and resurrect a contemporary interpretation of the sublime, however fleeting it may be.  In 2003, Content, a 544-page magazine-style book designed by &&& Creative and published by Koolhaas, gives an overview of the last decade of OMA projects including his designs for the Prada shops, the Seattle Public Library, a plan to save Cambridge from Harvard by rechanneling the Charles River, Lagos' future as Earth's third-biggest city, as well as interviews with Martha Stewart and Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Rem Koolhaas","rationale":"The text is about Rem Koolhaas, a Dutch architect who founded the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), which opened in 1975.

Changes in cell membrane permeability and production of reactive oxygen species by individual cells were monitored with fluorescent dyes.', 'Host cells and isolated human neutrophils died rapidly after adhesion to roughened polystyrene. Neutrophils adherent to roughened surfaces produced more reactive oxygen intermediates than those adherent to smooth surfaces and were first to die.

The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian.\\n\\nOn September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times.  Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them.  On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\"  Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather's retirement was hastened by this incident.

Composed for the 1709–10 Venice Carnevale season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \\"anti-heroic satirical comedy\\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI.\\nHandel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised  the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century.\\nIn the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.","target":"less","rationale":"Study A explained how increased greenhouse gases would affect the climate.

Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

Global and temporal monitoring of predominant bacterial pathogens is important to inform new treatment strategies, vaccine development and to monitor the impact of vaccine implementation to improve progress toward global OM prevention. A systematic review of published reports of microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) from January, 1970 to August 2014, was performed using PubMed databases. This review confirmed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, remain the predominant bacterial pathogens, with S. pneumoniae the predominant bacterium in the majority reports from AOM patients. In contrast, H. influenzae was the predominant bacterium for patients experiencing chronic OME, recurrent AOM and AOM with treatment failure. This result was consistent, even where improved detection sensitivity from the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rather than bacterial culture was conducted. On average, PCR analyses increased the frequency of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae 3.2 fold compared to culture, whilst Moraxella catarrhalis was 4.5 times more frequently identified by PCR. Molecular methods can also improve monitoring of regional changes in the serotypes and identification frequency of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae over time or after vaccine implementation, such as after introduction of the 7valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.","target":"Predominant Bacteria Detected from the Middle Ear Fluid of Children Experiencing Otitis Media: A Systematic Review","rationale":"The title should summarize the main findings of the research paper, which are that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae remain the predominant bacterial pathogens associated with Otitis Media (OM), with S. pneumoniae being more common than H. influenzae in acute OM patients, and H. influenzae being more common than S. pneumoniae in chronic OME, recurrent AOM, and AOM with treatment failure patients.

It is a branch of malacology . Those that study teuthology are known as teuthologists .\\n\\n- Malacology is the branch of invertebrate zoology that deals with the study of the Mollusca (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest phylum of animals in terms of described species after the arthropods. Mollusks include snails and slugs, clams, octopus and squid, and numerous other kinds, many (but by no means all) of which have shells. One division of malacology, conchology, is devoted to the study of mollusk shells. Malacology derives from Greek , \\"malakos\\", \\"soft\\"; and , \\"-logia\\".\\n\\n- Zoology (UK: , zoo-OL-luh-jee; US: , zoh-OL-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , \\"zion\\", i.e. \\"animal\\" and , \\"logos\\", i.e. \\"knowledge, study\\".\\n\\n- Snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name \\"snail\\" is also applied to most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word \\"snail\\" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also thousands of species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Occasionally a few other molluscs that are not actually gastropods, such as the Monoplacophora, which superficially resemble small limpets, may also informally be referred to as \\"snails\\".\\n\\n- An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. \\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.\\n\\n- Clam is the general common name of any mollusks within the class Bivalvia. More specifically, true clams are bivalves having two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and having a powerful burrowing foot. They are infaunal, spending most of their lives partially buried in the sand of the ocean floor. These characteristics distinguish the true clams from other bivalves, such as oysters, mussels, and scallops.\\n\\n- Slug, or land slug, is a common name for any apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word \\"slug\\" is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly sea slugs and semislugs (this is in contrast to the common name \\"snail\\", which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell).\\n\\n- Conchology (from \\"konkhos\\", \\"cockle\\") is the study of mollusc shells. Conchology is one aspect of malacology, the study of molluscs; however, malacology is the study of molluscs as whole organisms, whereas conchology is confined to the study of their shells. It includes the study of land and freshwater mollusc shells as well as seashells and extends to the study of a gastropod's operculum.\\n\\n- A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.\\n\\n- In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.\\n\\n- In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.\\n\\n- The molluscs (or mollusks ) compose the large phylum of invertebrate animals known as the Mollusca. Around 85,000 extant species of molluscs are recognized. Molluscs are the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebratesand either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total. The scientific study of molluscs is called malacology.\\n\\n- Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'field of work' with 'cephalopoda'.","target":"teuthology","rationale":"The definition of teuthology (the study of cephalopods) is given in the first paragraph. \\nTherefore, based on the context provided above, it can be inferred that teuthology has a 'field of work' relationship with cephalopoda."},{"source":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.\\nQuestion: What are found at Burnley?\\nContext: The major settlements in the ceremonial county are concentrated on the Fylde coast (the Blackpool Urban Area), and a belt of towns running west-east along the M65: Preston, Blackburn, Accrington, Burnley, Nelson and Colne.

To start off, I was 17m, my girlfriend was 18f. We'll call her dirt. So, I had just started up another year of school. And already from the last year, I've had my own circle of friends. Consisting of 3 males, including myself. And 3 females. A balanced group, a few of them; dirt in particular, I've never really paid much attention to, and didn't really care about them as much as the others as they always had their own flaws that annoyed me. Now me, being decently young back then, didn't really ever have a girlfriend before. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd to my shock, only about 2 months after knowing dirt. The messenger of our group, we'll call her mike, so mike, had just received a little gossip on dirt's recent crush, which just so happened to be me. At the end of the day, mike told me about it. I was mind blown, confused, dumbfounded. Basically a surge of emotions rolling around screaming what the hell is going on?? But I made up my mind. I wanted to try having a girlfriend, and so I did. The first few months went smoothly, she was so kind, and i was kind straight back. And the time we spent was fun. I couldn't have really asked for more. Then, at the end of the school year; my parents decided they'd like to finish my education by homeschooling me. Naturally, being myself. I agreed on a whim. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt wasn't until later when I looked into it more, that I realized I wouldn't be able to see dirt anymore. So our relationship would become long distance from now on.  So we went our separate ways, still together. But not in real life. In the first 3 months, I was hit with a heavy depression by this fact. I wouldn't leave my room for hours and i stopped caring about things. And to make things worse, when I finally recovered. She changed, she was like a different person almost. It was subtle but I could tell. At the time i had no clue and blissfully passed it off, but looking back now the signs were clear and I had the chance to run.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis is when it started, no longer theoretically being in moderation by me, she was free to do as she wished. And as such, she could change her priorities. So she started caring less, as dumb as I was, even I saw this coming. But the thing is, there was so much more to it. even now I don't know the half of what she did behind my back. She started being friends with my sister, and she started ERPing as well, (which stands for Erotic Role Playing) Of course at the time I had no clue she did this as I trusted her enough to not have to look on her social medias, otherwise I would have immediately ditched her for cheating.  And after this, started the deception and lies, she would lie to me. I would want to confront her about things she's been doing that don't really sit well in a relationship. But every time, she would pass it off. Then talk to my sister,\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow I'm not just being jealous here, she genuinely cared about my sister more than I. And I wasn't to happy as you could imagine, as that's not how this works. Multiple times i confronted her, to not avail. But, in the end started to grow knowledgeable. I realized that my issues can't be solved by no means that i've tried. And that I need to end it. She's showed all the unspoken and implied signs of a manipulative psychopath. So how would i go about this? At the time, I was still my too nice for my own good gullible self, I couldn't simply end it by talking to her about it, even on a whim. \\n\\nSo out of ideas, and approaching the 2 year mark for our realtionship, I decided, if I'm too weak to end it. I'll just get her to end it for me. So, I did the thing that annoyed her the most. Surpassing her, every time she tried to speak something factual, I would correct it, and the thing is, it was super easy, she's not the brightest so almost everything she said would have a bottom line or different answer. Eventually, she had enough and we finally broke up. There's more to this experience, but this is all that's relevant to the title.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo in all in all, I simply want to know Am i the asshole for doing what I did? And did i need to do it that way? Or were there better choices here.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: 17m, 18f girlfriend started off nice and happy, moved on to be a pyscho, discovered things about her.\\n\\nDecided to try and end it, not good enough to end it, so i let her do it for me by getting her to a point where she was sick of me.","target":"WRONG","rationale":"The author's girlfriend had a crush on him and they started dating.

The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word \\"tomatl\\" gave rise to the Spanish word \\"tomate\\", from which the English word tomato originates.\\nNumerous varieties of tomato are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing its production throughout the year and in cooler areas. The plants typically grow to in height and have a weak stem that often sprawls over the ground and vines over other plants. It is a perennial in its native habitat, and grown as an annual in temperate climates. An average common tomato weighs approximately .\\nIts use as a food originated in Mexico, and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are botanically berry-type fruits, they are considered culinary vegetables, being ingredients of savory meals.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n- Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.\\n\\n- Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.\\n\\n- Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.\\n\\n- Microtus is a genus of voles found in North America, Europe, and northern Asia. The genus name refers to the small ears of these animals. About 62 species are placed in the genus.\\nThey are stout rodents with short ears, legs, and tails.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats.\\n\\n- In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.\\n\\n- The water voles are large voles in the genus Arvicola . They are found in both aquatic and dry habitat through Europe and much of northern Asia . A water vole found in Western North America was historically considered a member of this genus , but has been shown to be more closely related to members of the genus Microtus ( Conroy and Cook , 2000 ; Musser and Carleton , 2005 ) . Head and body length are 12 -- 22 cm , tail length is 6.5 -- 12.5 cm , and the weight is 70 -- 250 g. The animals may exhibit indeterminate growth . They are thick - furred and have hairy fringe on feet that improves their swimming ability .\\n\\n- Alexandromys is a subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\".

A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.\\n\\n- A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (\\"Mus musculus\\"). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.\\n\\n- Mynomes is a North American subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are:\\nReferences.\\nD.E. Wilson & D.M.

The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .\\n\\n- The Arvicolinae are a subfamily of rodents that includes the voles, lemmings, and muskrats. They are most closely related to the other subfamilies in the Cricetidae (comprising the hamsters and New World rats and mice). Some authorities place the subfamily Arvicolinae in the family Muridae along with all other members of the superfamily Muroidea. Some refer to the subfamily as the Microtinae or rank the taxon as a full family, the Arvicolidae.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- In biology and botany, indeterminate growth is growth that is not terminated in contrast to determinate growth that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces flowers and fruit until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to tomato varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth/fruit, or dies.\\n\\n- Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.\\n\\n- A lemming is a small rodent, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. Lemmings are subniveal animals and together with voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils.\\n\\n- Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\".

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which child is nearsighted?","target":"Molly","rationale":"Molly is having difficulty seeing what the teacher has written on the board, whereas Clarence does not. This suggests that Molly may be nearsighted and unable to clearly see objects far away from her eyes.\\nNearsightedness first occurs in school-age children like Clarence and Molly, so it makes sense for one of them to have this condition rather than their mother or father.  The hint also mentions individuals who spend a lot of time reading as being more likely to develop nearsightedness; since students often read at school, this supports our conclusion that one of these two classmates would have myopia."},{"source":"Write a question about the following article: Soon after the Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace. The Poles, exhausted, constantly pressured by the Western governments and the League of Nations, and with its army controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. The Soviets made two offers: one on 21 September and the other on 28 September. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on 2 October. On the 5th, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer, which Poland accepted. The Preliminary Treaty of Peace and Armistice Conditions between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on 12 October, and the armistice went into effect on 18 October. Ratifications were exchanged at Liepāja on 2 November. Long negotiations of the final peace treaty ensued. Meanwhile, Petliura's Ukrainian forces, which now numbered 23,000 soldiers and controlled territories immediately to the east of Poland, planned an offensive in Ukraine for 11 November but were attacked by the Bolsheviks on 10 November.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- Kingfishers are a group of small to medium-sized, brightly colored birds in the order Coraciiformes. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species found outside of the Americas. The group is treated either as a single family, the Alcedinidae, or as a suborder Alcedines containing three families, Alcedinidae (river kingfishers), Halcyonidae (tree kingfishers), and Cerylidae (water kingfishers). Roughly 90 species of kingfishers are described. All have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with few differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests. They consume a wide range of prey, as well as fish, usually caught by swooping down from a perch. While kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish, most species live away from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other members of their order, they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of all kingfishers nest in abandoned termite nests. A few species, principally insular forms, are threatened with extinction. In Britain, the word \\"kingfisher\\" normally refers to the common kingfisher.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- The African pygmy kingfisher (\\"Ispidina picta\\") is a small insectivorous kingfisher found in the Afrotropics, mostly in woodland habitats. Some texts refer to this species as \\"Ceyx pictus\\".\\n\\n- Woodland is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests. \\n\\n- Ispidina is a genus of very small insectivorous African water kingfishers .

J. Cherryh, published by DAW Books. They concern a time-traveling heroine, Morgaine, and her loyal companion Nhi Vanye i Chya.\\n\\n- A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.\\n\\n- The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.\\n\\n- Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".\\n\\n- Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.\\n\\n- Well of Shiuan is a 1978 science fiction novel written by C. J. Cherryh . It is the second of four books composing the Morgaine Stories , chronicling the deeds of Morgaine , a woman obsessed with a mission of the utmost importance , and her warrior companion , Nhi Vanye i Chya .\\n\\n- Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\\n\\n- DAW Books is an American science fiction and fantasy publisher, founded by Donald A. Wollheim following his departure from Ace Books in 1971. The company therefore claims to be \\"the first publishing company ever devoted exclusively to science fiction and fantasy.\\" The first DAW Book published was the 1972 short story collection \\"Spell of the Witch World\\" by Andre Norton.\\n\\n- Downbelow Station is a science fiction novel written by C. J. Cherryh and published in 1981 by DAW Books. It won the Hugo Award in 1982, was shortlisted for a Locus Award that same year, and was named by \\"Locus\\" magazine as one of the top 50 science fiction novels of all time in 1987.\\n\\n- The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Carolyn Janice Cherry (born September 1, 1942), better known by the pen name C. J. Cherryh, is an American writer of speculative fiction.

A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska.

This could account for the increased airway narrowing seen in vivo in allergic bronchoconstriction. It was associated with increased velocity of shortening. We now report that, by using an electromagnetic muscle lever system, quick releases were applied to control and sensitized TSM at 0.5-s intervals throughout the course of a lightly preloaded 10-s isotonic contraction. From the records obtained it is possible to determine that, early in contraction, shortening is brought about by relatively rapidly cycling [0.35 optimal muscle length units +/- 0.033/s (SE)] cross bridges. We also report that in the sensitized TSM it is the early bridges that increase their velocity by 26.6% (P less than 0.05) compared with similar bridges in muscles from control animals. Since 70% of the maximum shortening of the muscle occurs when early bridges are operative, it is likely that these bridges are responsible for the major part of the shortening. It is thus probable that increased allergic bronchoconstriction is produced by increased activity of early, rapidly cycling bridges. The bridges that are active late in the shortening show no difference between control and sensitized airway smooth muscles. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Changes in cross-bridge properties of sensitized airway smooth muscle. option2: The influence of immunity on raw milk--associated Campylobacter infection.","target":"Changes in cross-bridge properties of sensitized airway smooth muscle","rationale":"In this abstract, the authors investigate how airway smooth muscle cells behave differently in sensitized and control animals.

Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year.

Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) is known for its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1 Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively.

The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love.\\nIn an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour.

We have observed substantial progress in this topic through lower and upper bounds on the maximum number of linear regions and a counting procedure. However, these bounds only account for the dimensions of the network and the exact counting may take a prohibitive amount of time, therefore making it infeasible to benchmark the expressiveness of networks. In this work, we approximate the number of linear regions of specific rectifier networks with an algorithm for probabilistic lower bounds of mixed-integer linear sets. In addition, we present a tighter upper bound that leverages network coefficients. We test both on trained networks. The algorithm for probabilistic lower bounds is several orders of magnitude faster than exact counting and the values reach similar orders of magnitude, hence making our approach a viable method to compare the expressiveness of such networks.

Patent protection enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the branded drug. When the patent protection for the drug expires, a generic drug is usually developed and sold by a competing company. The development and approval of generics is less expensive, allowing them to be sold at a lower price.

Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India.\\n\\n- The thylacine (, or , also ;\\nbinomial name: \\"Thylacinus cynocephalus\\", Greek for \\"dog-headed pouched one\\") was the largest known carnivorous marsupial of modern times. It is commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger (because of its striped lower back) or the Tasmanian wolf. Native to continental Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea, it is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century. It was the last extant member of its family, Thylacinidae; specimens of other members of the family have been found in the fossil record dating back to the late Oligocene.\\n\\n- Macropus titan is an extinct Australian vertebrate species belonging to the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning 'large foot'), the same family as the kangaroos. \\"M. titan\\" lived during the Pleistocene.\\n\\n- Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.\\n\\n- Pademelons are small marsupials of the genus Thylogale. They are usually found in forests. Pademelons are one of the smallest of the macropods. The name is a corruption of \\"badimaliyan\\", from the Dharuk Aboriginal language of Port Jackson (Sydney region).\\n\\n- The koala (\\"Phascolarctos cinereus\\", or, inaccurately, koala bear) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of and weighs . Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.\\n\\n- The bettongs are species of the genus Bettongia, sometimes referred to as rat-kangaroos. Four extant species are recognised:\\n\\n- Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD).

The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\\n\\n- The Tasmanian devil (\\"Sarcophilus harrisii\\") is a carnivorous marsupial of the family Dasyuridae, now found in the wild only on the Australian island state of Tasmania, including tiny east-coast Maria Island where there is a conservation project with disease-free animals.\\n\\n- The eastern grey kangaroo (\\"Macropus giganteus\\") is a marsupial found in southern and eastern Australia, with a population of several million. It is also known as the great grey kangaroo and the Forester kangaroo. Although a big eastern grey male typically masses around 66 kg (weight 145 lb.) and stands almost 2 m (6.6 ft.) tall, the scientific name, \\"Macropus giganteus\\" (gigantic large-foot), is misleading: the red kangaroo of the semi-arid inland is larger, weighing up to 90 kg.\\n\\n- The opossums, also known as possums, are marsupial mammals of the order Didelphimorphia ). The largest order of marsupials in the Western Hemisphere, it comprises 103 or more species in 19 genera. Opossums originated in South America, and entered North America in the Great American Interchange following the connection of the two continents. Their unspecialized biology, flexible diet, and reproductive habits make them successful colonizers and survivors in diverse locations and conditions.\\n\\n- Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, and the quokka.\\n\\n- Macropods are marsupials belonging to the family Macropodidae, the kangaroo family, which includes kangaroos, wallabies, tree-kangaroos, pademelons, quokkas, and several others. Macropods are native to the Australian continent (the mainland, Tasmania, New Guinea and nearby islands). Before European settlement of Australia, about 65 species of macropods existed. Six species have since become extinct and a further eleven have been greatly reduced in numbers. Other species (e.g. \\"Simosthenurus\\", \\"Propleopus\\", \\"Macropus titan\\") became extinct after the Australian Aborigines arrived and before the Europeans arrived.\\n\\n- The red kangaroo (\\"Macropus rufus\\") is the largest of all kangaroos, the largest terrestrial mammal native to Australia, and the largest extant marsupial. It is found across mainland Australia, avoiding only the more fertile areas in the south, the east coast, and the northern rainforests.\\n\\n- Propleopus is an extinct genus of marsupials. Three species are known, \\"P. chillagoensis\\" from the Plio-Pleistocene, \\"P. oscillans\\", and \\"P. wellingtonensis\\" from the Pleistocene. In contrast to most other kangaroos, and similar to its small extant relative, the musky rat-kangaroo, it was probably omnivorous.\\n\\n- The quoll (genus Dasyurus) is a carnivorous marsupial native to mainland Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. It is primarily nocturnal and spends most of the day in its den. Of the six species of quoll, four are found in Australia and two in New Guinea. Another two species are known from fossil remains in Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits in Queensland. Genetic evidence indicates that the quoll evolved around 15 million years ago in the Miocene, and that the ancestors of the six species had all diverged by around four million years ago. The quoll species vary in weight and size, from to . They have brown or black fur and pink noses. They are largely solitary, but come together for a few social interactions such as mating which occurs during the winter season. A female gives birth to up to 18 puppies, of which only six survive.\\n\\n- Wallaroo is any of three closely related species of moderately large macropod, intermediate in size between the kangaroos and the wallabies. The word \\"wallaroo\\" is from Dharug \\"walaru\\". In general, a large, slim-bodied macropod of the open plains is called a \\"kangaroo\\"; a small to medium-sized one, particularly if it is relatively thick-set, is a \\"wallaby\\": most wallaroos are only a little smaller than a kangaroo, fairly thickset, and are found in open country. All share a particular habit of stance: wrists raised, elbows tucked close into the body, and shoulders thrown back, and all have a large, black-skinned rhinarium.\\n\\n- The numbat (\\"Myrmecobius fasciatus\\"), also known as the banded anteater, marsupial anteater, or walpurti, is a marsupial found in Western Australia. Its diet consists almost exclusively of termites. Once widespread across southern Australia, its range is now restricted to several small colonies, and it is listed as an endangered species. The numbat is an emblem of Western Australia and protected by conservation programs.\\n\\n- A wallaby is a small- or mid-sized macropod found in Australia and New Guinea. They belong to the same taxonomic family as kangaroos and sometimes the same genus, but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the six largest species of the family. The term wallaby is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- Simosthenurus, also referred to as the short-faced kangaroo, is an extinct genus of megafaunal macropods that existed in Australia, specifically Tasmania, during the Pleistocene. Analysis of \\"Simosthenurus\\" fossils has contributed to the finding that there are three lineages of macropods: Sthenurinae, Macropodinae, and Lagostrophinae. The genus \\"Simosthenurus\\" was among the sthenurines.\\n\\n- The western grey kangaroo (\\"Macropus fuliginosus\\"), also referred to as a black-faced kangaroo, mallee kangaroo, and sooty kangaroo, is a large and very common kangaroo found across almost the entire southern part of Australia, from just south of Shark Bay to coastal South Australia, Western Australia, western Victoria, and the entire MurrayDarling basin in New South Wales and Queensland.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.\\n\\n- Bandicoots are a group of about 20 species of small to medium-sized, terrestrial marsupial omnivore in the order Peramelemorphia. They are endemic to the AustraliaNew Guinea region.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- The antilopine kangaroo (\\"Macropus antilopinus\\"), sometimes called the antilopine wallaroo or the antilopine wallaby, is a species of macropod found in northern Australia: in Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is a locally common, gregarious grazer.\\n\\n- Macropus is a marsupial genus that belongs to the family Macropodidae . It has thirteen extant species which are further divided into three subgenera . The genus includes all terrestrial kangaroos , wallaroos , and several species of wallaby . The term itself is derived from the Ancient Greek  , makros \`\` long '' and  , pous \`\` foot '' . A further eleven extinct species are recognised . The type species is the eastern grey kangaroo .\\n\\n- The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning \\"large foot\\"). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus \\"Macropus\\": the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia. The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million one year earlier.\\n\\n- Wombats are short-legged, muscular quadrupedal marsupials that are native to Australia. They are about in length with small, stubby tails. There are three extant species and they are all members of the family Vombatidae. They are adaptable and habitat tolerant, and are found in forested, mountainous, and heathland areas of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania, as well as an isolated patch of about in Epping Forest National Park in central Queensland.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'macropus' and 'macropodinae'?","target":"parent taxon","rationale":"The answer is \\"parent taxon\\"."},{"source":"Can you tell me the answer to who plays wu bosong in a love so beautiful??","target":"Gao Zhiting","rationale":"The answer is Gao Zhiting.\\nGao Zhiting plays the character Wu Bosong in A Love So Beautiful (Chinese: 致我们单纯的小美好; pinyin: zhì wǒmen dānchún de xiǎoměihǎo) which is a Chinese web drama series starring Shen Yue and Hu Yitian, based on the novel To Our Pure Little Beauty by Zhao Ganghui ."},{"source":"Given a trivia question, classify broad topical category from this list: 'theater', 'geology', 'book', 'tv', 'astronomy', 'aviation', 'military', 'government', 'boxing', 'projects', 'metropolitan_transit', 'law', 'venture_capital', 'broadcast', 'biology', 'people', 'influence', 'baseball', 'spaceflight', 'media_common', 'cvg', 'opera', 'olympics', 'chemistry', 'visual_art', 'conferences', 'sports', 'language', 'travel', 'location', 'award', 'dining', 'martial_arts', 'comic_strips', 'computer', 'user', 'tennis', 'music', 'organization', 'food', 'event', 'transportation', 'fictional_universe', 'measurement_unit', 'meteorology', 'distilled_spirits', 'symbols', 'architecture', 'freebase', 'internet', 'fashion', 'boats', 'cricket', 'film', 'medicine', 'finance', 'comic_books', 'celebrities', 'soccer', 'games', 'time', 'geography', 'interests', 'common', 'base', 'business', 'periodicals', 'royalty', 'education', 'type', 'religion', 'automotive', 'exhibitions'.\\n\\nWhat brothers compiled fairy tales including Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin?","target":"book","rationale":"The given text is a question about fairy tales which are typically published as books."},{"source":"Given a question and its paraphrases, answer the question.

I couldn't think of the answer.\\"\\nThe young student was experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the great nervousness. though poor scores are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety causes low scores. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students.\\nSpecial university counseling  courses try to help students. In these courses, counselors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the test shows their anxiety is high, the students can take courses to help them deal with their nervousness. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease, learn information, then come out without difficulty in a test.\\nAn expert at the University of California explains, \\"With almost all students, relaxation is felt after taking our program.

Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.”\\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway.\\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\\nAndrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s.\\nQuestion: After this event:\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. not enough information\\n\\nB. peace prevail\\n\\nC. issue stopped\\n\\nD. bridge built","target":"D","rationale":"The context explains that the Rialto Bridge was destroyed several times and a new bridge had to be built.

From the band's formation in 1989, its line-up remained unchanged until the firing of Weiland in February 2013. Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington joined the band in May 2013. In November 2015, Bennington left the band to focus solely on Linkin Park.\\n\\nTwo conflicting stories of how frontman Scott Weiland and bassist Robert DeLeo met have been described by the band; one was that Weiland and DeLeo met at a Black Flag concert in Long Beach, California in 1985. They began discussing their girlfriends, only to realize they were dating the same woman. However, instead of letting this come between them, they developed a bond and formed a band after they each subsequently broke it off with the girl. Weiland presented a different version of meeting Robert in his autobiography, stating that Weiland and his friends--guitarist Corey Hicock and drummer David Allin--pursued Robert after witnessing him play live with him sitting in during sets at various gigs with their band Soi Disant.  However, after a few years Allin went his separate way pursuing other interests. The remaining members witnessed drummer Eric Kretz play in a Long Beach club and convinced him to join the band. Guitarist Hicock eventually left the band in 1989; in need of a replacement and auditioning many guitarists, Robert suggested his older brother, Dean. At the time, Dean was a successful businessman who had left behind his previous career as a musician, but still played guitar as a hobby. The band managed to convince Dean to play guitar for Swing, completing the original STP lineup. Dean reportedly refused to continue playing in a band called \\"Swing,\\"  and shortly afterwards the band became Mighty Joe Young. The band recorded a demo tape that was completed around 1990. The Mighty Joe Young demo features tracks that would go on to be re-recorded for the band's first studio album, as well as some musical styles that would not be featured on any of STP's studio albums, such as funk and yodeling.  Mighty Joe Young played several gigs in the San Diego area, building up a fanbase. Their first show was supporting Henry Rollins at the Whisky a Go Go. The group then began to work on their debut album with Brendan O'Brien. During the recording, they received a call from their lawyer who informed them that there was a bluesman who had already claimed the name Mighty Joe Young. Inspired by the STP Motor Oil stickers that the band members were fans of in their youth, various ideas on the initials \\"STP\\" were shared by the band, including \\"Shirley Temple's Pussy\\" and Stereo Temple Pirates.

The \\"Old Flame\\" album produced hit singles for more than sixteen months, with the final release being \\"What Can I Do with My Heart\\" (written by Otha Young), which reached the Top 10 in early 1987.  Newton returned to the Top 10 in 1988 with \\"Tell Me True\\" from her 1987 album Emotion. The album's lead single, the progressive-country tune \\"First Time Caller,\\" stalled at No. 24. Her final album of the decade, Ain't Gonna Cry (1989), was not promoted by the label and did not chart. But it did spawn her final Top-40 country hit to date, \\"When Love Comes Around the Bend,\\" which RCA refused to release as a single because Newton's contract had not been renewed.  After being dropped by RCA Records in 1989 (along with several other country artists, including Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers, as country music as a whole was about to undergo momentous change), Newton took time to focus on her family life. Newton took a hiatus from recording albums, touring sporadically until returning to the music scene in late 1990s when she released the albums \\"The Trouble with Angels\\" (1998) and \\"American Girl\\" (1999).\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Who was Juice Newton\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"Newton had always been moderately popular in country music;","rationale":"The context mentions that Newton had always been moderately popular in country music.

For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer?\\nScientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer.\\nIn a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them.\\nCancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet.\\nDrinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics.\\nSome believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising,...\\nWhy do scientists think ginger can be used to fight against cancer?\\nA) Ginger can destroy diseased cells in two different ways.\\nB) Ginger is commonly considered as a kind of pain killer.\\nC) Ginger warms people's bodies and helps them recover from operations.\\nD) Ginger has no harmful side effects according to a large amount of medical research.","target":"A","rationale":"The passage mentions that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two ways: by causing the diseased cells to destroy themselves, and preventing them from growing.\\nThis means scientists have discovered this property of ginger - it destroys unhealthy or cancerous cells when consumed in high amounts. It does not mean people should take ginger as a pain killer for any kind of operation; instead they should consume large quantities of ginger regularly if there is a possibility that their body will develop some form of cancer later on.  This was also shown explicitly in the study over mice mentioned above where only those who had been given higher concentrations of ginger did better than others at fighting off disease , hence A) Ginger can destroy diseased cells in two different ways is correct ."},{"source":"Sometimes users of dialogue systems ask vague questions/queries from the system.

For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the Golden mean. The most important aspect of beauty was therefore an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially; and was based on universal, recognisable truths.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.\\n\\nDavid wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.\\n\\nWould species B's traits be more or less common than species A's?","target":"less","rationale":"The question is asking about species A and B, which are deer. The context states that Darwin's theory of evolution proposes that organisms with advantageous traits are more fit to survive in a particular environment than those less suited for survival. This would mean the helpful traits of species A will be more common over time because they are better equipped to survive in their environment, while the harmful traits of species B will become rarer due to lower fitness for surviving in their habitat.\\nSo, it follows that both sets of traits cannot exist at equal frequency or abundance; one set must be greater than another since natural selection favors certain characteristics over others based on environmental factors like food supply and physical conditions (e.g., climate). Therefore, we can infer from this information that species B's harmful trait(s)"},{"source":"You are provided with an arithmetic question.

The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot.","target":"more","rationale":"The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to  2 1/2 inches high, whereas the Augusta County Club's is cut shorter at 4 inches.\\nIf Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf and Jack prefers it with less difficulty, then based on that criteria alone we would expect them both to prefer different courses; however this contradiction can be explained by looking further into what constitutes \\"more\\" or \\"less\\" challenging.\\nHigher mowing heights are generally thought to produce easier play because they reduce roll distance and allow for better contact between clubface and ball (ease of hitting).

The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin.

No grill is air-tight, so even though it gets a good heat blast (not enough to sterilize it as you may think), spores will get in from outside.

The soluble proteins from alveolar washes inhibited the surface tension lowering properties of natural surfactant, whereas those from the control rabbits did not (P less than 0.01). When vagotomy rabbits in respiratory failure were treated with 50 mg natural surfactant lipid per kilogram arterial blood gas values and compliances improved relative to control rabbits.

In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being, and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss.\\n\\n- Breast development, also known as mammogenesis, is a complex biological process in primates that takes place throughout a female's life. It occurs across several phases, including prenatal development, puberty, and pregnancy. At menopause, breast development ceases and the breasts atrophy. Breast development results in prominent and developed structures on the chest known as breasts in primates, which serve as both a sexual characteristic and as mammary glands. The process is mediated by an assortment of hormones (and growth factors), the most important of which include estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and growth hormone.\\n\\n- Growth hormone (GH), also known as somatotropin (or as human growth hormone [hGH or HGH] in its human form), is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. It is thus important in human development. It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to certain kinds of cells. Growth hormone is a 191-amino acid, single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized, stored, and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.\\n\\n- A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.\\n\\n- Estrogen (American English) or oestrogen (British English) is the primary female sex hormone as well as a medication. It is responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. \\"Estrogen\\" may also refer to any substance, natural or synthetic, that mimics the effects of the natural hormone. The estrane steroid estradiol is the most potent and prevalent endogenous estrogen, although several metabolites of estradiol also have estrogenic hormonal activity. Estrogens are used as medications as part of some oral contraceptives, in hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal, hypogonadal, and transgender women, and in the treatment of certain hormone-sensitive cancers like prostate cancer and breast cancer. They are one of three types of sex hormones, the others being androgens/anabolic steroids like testosterone and progestogens like progesterone.\\n\\n- Androgen (from Greek \\"andro\\" meaning male human being), also called androgenic hormone or testoid, is any natural or synthetic compound, usually a steroid hormone, that stimulates or controls the development and maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates by binding to androgen receptors. This includes the activity of the primary male sex organs and development of male secondary sex characteristics. Androgens were first discovered in 1936. Androgens increase in both boys and girls during puberty. Androgens are also the original anabolic steroids and the precursor of all estrogens. The primary and most well-known androgen is testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione are less known generally, but are of equal importance in male development. DHT in the embryo life causes differentiation of penis, scrotum and prostate. Later in life DHT contributes to balding, prostate growth and sebaceous gland activity. Although androgens are described as male sex hormones, both males and females have them to varying degrees, as is also true of estrogens. They are one of three types of sex hormones, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone.\\n\\n- A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.\\n\\n- A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal.\\n\\n- The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of female primates. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development. Males do not develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts because their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing breast tissue. The breasts of females are typically far more prominent than those of males.\\n\\n- Intraductal papillomas of the breast are benign lesions with an incidence of approximately 2 - 3 % in humans . Two types of intraductal papillomas are generally distinguished . The central type develops near the nipple . They are usually solitary and often arise in the period nearing menopause . On the other hand , the peripheral type are often multiple papillomas arising at the peripheral breasts , and are usually found in younger women . The peripheral type are associated with a higher risk of malignancy . They are the most common cause of bloody nipple discharge in women age 20 - 40 and generally do not show up on mammography due to their small size , so the next step in treatment would be a galactogram to guide the subsequent biopsy . The masses are often too small to be palpated or felt . A galactogram is therefore necessary to rule out the lesion . Excision is sometimes performed . Microdochectomy / microdochotomy ( removal of a breast duct ) is the treatment of choice .\\n\\n- The torso or trunk is an anatomical term for the central part of the many animal bodies (including that of the human) from which extend the neck and limbs. The torso includes the thorax and the abdomen.\\n\\n- A lesion is any abnormal damage or change in the tissue of an organism, usually caused by disease or trauma. \\"Lesion\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"laesio\\" meaning \\"injury\\". Lesions may occur in plants as well as animals.\\n\\n- A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).\\n\\n- An infant (from the Latin word \\"infans\\", meaning \\"unable to speak\\" or \\"speechless\\") is the more formal or specialised synonym for \\"baby\\", the very young offspring of a human or other animal. \\n\\n- Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'intraductal papilloma' and 'disease'?","target":"instance of","rationale":"Here's the rationale:\\n  \\"intraductal papilloma\\" is an instance of a disease."},{"source":"Question: \\"Where did she end up during special occasions?\\"\\n\\nContext: \\"Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays.

By April 1900, the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war. In July, her second son Alfred (\\"Affie\\") died; \\"Oh, God!

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian. A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion. The newly converted Muslims were known as nuevos cristianos  or moriscos . Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics. This culminated in Philip II's Pragmatica of 1 January 1567 which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language. The pragmatica triggered the Morisco revolts in 1568-1571.\\n\\nHow many years did the Morisco revolts last?","target":"3","rationale":"The Morisco revolts started in 1568 and ended in 1571.

This technology represents a promising platform for rapid highresolution genotyping of microorganisms. Traditional array-based resequencing methods have relied on the use of specific PCR-amplified fragments from the query samples as hybridization targets. While this specificity in the target DNA population reduces the potential for artifacts caused by cross-hybridization, the subsampling of the query genome limits the sequence coverage that can be obtained and therefore reduces the technique's resolution as a genotyping method. We have developed and validated an Affymetrix Inc. GeneChip array-based, whole-genome resequencing platform for Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. A set of bioinformatic filters that targeted systematic base-calling errors caused by cross-hybridization between the wholegenome sample and the array probes and by deletions in the sample DNA relative to the chip reference sequence were developed. Our approach eliminated 91% of the false-positive singlenucleotide polymorphism calls identified in the SCHU S4 query sample, at the cost of 10.7% of the true positives, yielding a total base-calling accuracy of 99.992%. \\n Title: A bioinformatic filter for improved base-call accuracy and polymorphism detection using the Affymetrix GeneChip Õ whole-genome resequencing platform","target":"False","rationale":"The paragraph provides details about the development and validation of an Affymetrix Inc.

It has been further suggested that the vagal component of this prolongation of TE is due to the temporal summation of pulmonary stretch receptor (PSR) activity during expiratory loading. This hypothesis was tested in rabbits exposed to resistive and elastic single-breath expiratory loading while PSR's were simultaneously recorded. Both types of loads resulted in a decreased expired volume (VE) and increased expiratory duration (TE). The TE for resistive loads were significantly greater than for elastic loads for equivalent VE. Thus two different VE-TE relationships were found for resistive and elastic loads. When TE was plotted against the area under the expired volume trajectory, a single linear relationship was observed. PSR activity recorded during expiratory loading increased as VE decreased and TE increased. A single linear relationship resulted when the number of PSR spikes during the expiration was plotted against the associated TE for all types of loads. These findings demonstrate that the volume-related prolongation of TE with single-breath expiratory loads is associated with an increase in PSR discharge. These results support the hypothesis that the vagal component of load-dependent prolongation of TE is a function of both the temporal and spatial summation of PSR activity during the expiratory phase.","target":"Action Potentials","rationale":"The abstract introduces the relationship between pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs) and expiratory time, and provides data that support the hypothesis that PSR activity is responsible for vagal-dependent prolongation of expiratory time during single-breath expiratory loading.

Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying.

In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, \\"His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'.\\" They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes \\"cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning\\". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with \\"an eye on Mein Kampf\\". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, \\"proving both that it is not just the early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator\\".Vikernes himself has connected the church burnings to an idea of resurgent Viking paganism. The first such burning, that of Fantoft Church on June 6, 1992, was thought by many to be related to Satanism, since the burning occurred on the sixth day of the week, on day six of the sixth month and was thus a reference to the Number of the Beast.

Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.\\n\\n- Edwin Neal (born July 12, 1945) is an American actor, perhaps best known for his role as Nubbins Sawyer (the Hitchhiker) in \\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\\".

I had those blades that you screwed onto the soles of your shoes, but I was tall, and the 9-year-olds didn't have a goalie, so they put me in with them and thats where I fell in love with the game of hockey.\\n\\nBefore the start of the next season, Hasek was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in an attempt to lower the Sabres' payroll and to send Hasek to a more competitive team. He was dealt for Vyacheslav Kozlov, a first round selection in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft and future considerations, which eventually became the draft pick of Jim Slater. During his first season with Detroit, Hasek posted a career high 41 wins with just 15 losses, helping the Red Wings earn the President's Trophy with the league's best record. In the playoffs, he led the Wings past the Vancouver Canucks, the St. Louis Blues, the Colorado Avalanche and eventually the Carolina Hurricanes in the finals to win the Stanley Cup. During the conference finals against Colorado, he became the first goalie to be awarded an assist on an overtime game-winning goal in the post-season after passing the puck to Wings captain Steve Yzerman, who then assisted Fredrik Olausson in scoring the final goal of the third game of that series. He also set a record for most shutouts in a post-season with six, broken the year after by Martin Brodeur with seven.  That summer, Hasek officially announced his retirement so that he could spend time with his family and other hobbies. However, after Detroit's first round loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the following season, he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on Curtis Joseph's three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Avalanche would be looking for a goalie to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement. With Manny Legace also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.  In the 2003-04 season Hasek injured his groin after playing just 14 games. On January 9, he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hasek privately told general manager Ken Holland that he would not accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he announced that he was not going to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about $3 million of his $6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in Prague, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate.\\n\\nwhat is the most important fact in this article?","target":"Hasek officially announced his retirement so that he could spend time with his family and other hobbies.","rationale":"The most important fact in the article is that Hasek officially announced his retirement so that he could spend time with his family and other hobbies. \\nThis information can be found in section three of the text, which states: \\"\\"However, after Detroit's first round loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the following season, he expressed his desire to play again.\\"\\""},{"source":"The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama.\\nIn an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump.

To understand the elements of the periodic table better he categorized them into three groups, cat A, cat B, and cat C. In cat A he placed all the elements with atomic numbers lower than 83. In cat B he put the elements with atomic numbers from 83 to 94. Finally, in cat C he placed the elements with atomic numbers over 94. He found it easier to see their differences after he categorized them.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich category would less likely have stable isotopes, cat A or cat B?\\n\\nHint: Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 82 each have at least one stable isotope (except for technetium, element 43 and promethium, element 61, which have no stable isotopes). Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our Solar System. At over 1.9×1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements.

Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career.

He left upon the death of close friend Bud Worsham (1929-1950) and enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard, where he served for three years, 1951-1954.\\n\\nPalmer was married to the former Winnie Walzer (1934-1999) for 45 years; the couple had two daughters. She died at age 65 on November 20, 1999, from complications due to ovarian cancer. His grandson, Sam Saunders, is a professional golfer who grew up playing at Bay Hill, where he won the club championship at age 15. He attended Clemson University in South Carolina on a golf scholarship and turned pro in 2008. Saunders stated that Palmer's family nickname is \\"Dumpy\\". He married his second wife, Kathleen Gawthrop, in 2005 in Hawaii.  During the spring and summer months, Palmer resided in Latrobe, and he spent winters in Orlando and La Quinta, California. He first visited Orlando in 1948 during a college match. When he took up residence in Orlando, Palmer helped the city become a recreation destination, \\"turning the entire state of Florida into a golfing paradise\\". That included building one of the premier events on the PGA Tour there along with his contributing to new hospitals. On hearing about Palmer's death, Tiger Woods said, \\"My kids were born at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies, and his philanthropic work will be remembered along with his accomplishments in golf.\\" Arnold Palmer Boulevard is named in his honor.  Palmer had supported Scottish football club Rangers F.C. since his boyhood. He was a member of the Freemasons since 1958. Palmer created the Arnie's Army Charitable Foundation to help children and youth. The Foundation saw the creation of the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies Center, The Howard Philips Center for Children & Families, the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, and the Winnie Palmer Nature Reserve. He was also a spokesman for Hertz Rent-a-Car with O. J. Simpson.  During his playing career, Arnold Palmer smoked cigarettes, which caused him to battle an addiction to nicotine. He noted that many of his colleagues smoked, and he even endorsed the product in television commercials. Later in life, Palmer made a complete about-face and urged the public to give up smoking. He said that cigarette smoking has a negative effect on every organ in the body.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Arnold Palmer","rationale":"Arnold Palmer is the subject of this paragraph.

He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\",\\n\\nanswer the following question.
