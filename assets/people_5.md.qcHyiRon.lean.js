Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries.

Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.

The genus is usually placed in the birch family Betulaceae, though some botanists split the hazels (with the hornbeams and allied genera) into a separate family Corylaceae. The fruit of the hazel is the hazelnut.\\n\\n- Hornbeams are hardwood trees in the flowering plant genus \\"Carpinus\\" in the birch family Betulaceae. The 3040 species occur across much of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.\\n\\n- Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\"\\n\\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).\\n\\n- The birch family, the Betulaceae, includes six genera of deciduous nut-bearing trees and shrubs, including the birches, alders, hazels, hornbeams, hazel-hornbeam, and hop-hornbeams numbering a total of 167 species. They are mostly natives of the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species reaching the Southern Hemisphere in the Andes in South America. Their typical flowers are catkins and often appear before leaves.\\n\\n- Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.\\n\\n- BIRCH (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an unsupervised data mining algorithm used to perform hierarchical clustering over particularly large data-sets. An advantage of BIRCH is its ability to incrementally and dynamically cluster incoming, multi-dimensional metric data points in an attempt to produce the best quality clustering for a given set of resources (memory and time constraints). In most cases, BIRCH only requires a single scan of the database.\\n\\n- Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St.Â Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population ofÂ 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of .\\n\\n- In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.\\n\\n- Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\\n\\n- A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6Â m (20Â ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2Â m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.\\n\\n- Alder is the common name of a genus of flowering plants (Alnus) belonging to the birch family Betulaceae.

The defining feature that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea) is that they have membrane-bound organelles, especially the nucleus, which contains the genetic material and is enclosed by the nuclear envelope. The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name, which comes from the Greek  (\\"eu\\", \\"well\\" or \\"true\\") and  (\\"karyon\\", \\"nut\\" or \\"kernel\\"). Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. In addition, plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Eukaryotic organisms may be unicellular or multicellular. Only eukaryotes form multicellular organisms consisting of many kinds of tissue made up of different cell types.\\n\\n- Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city.\\n\\n- Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 millionÂ km (1.54 millionÂ mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia.\\n\\n- The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18Â° south and 20Â° south latitude), and of an average height of about .

Variation in traits is controlled by different alleles for genes. Alleles, in turn, are passed to gametes and then to offspring. Evolution occurs because of changes in alleles over time. How long a time? That depends on the time scale of evolution you consider. Evolution that occurs over a short period of time is known as microevolution. It might take place in just a couple of generations. This scale of evolution occurs at the level of the population. The Grants observed evolution at this scale in populations of Darwins finches. Beak size in finch populations changed in just two years because of a serious drought. Evolution that occurs over a long period of time is called macroevolution. It might take place over millions of years. This scale of evolution occurs above the level of the species. Fossils provide evidence for evolution at this scale. The evolution of the horse family, shown in Figure 7.13, is an example of macroevolution. Individuals dont evolve. Their alleles dont change over time. The unit of microevolution is the population. A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. All the genes in all the members of a population make up the populations gene pool. For each gene, the gene pool includes all the different alleles in the population. The gene pool can be described by its allele frequencies for specific genes. The frequency of an allele is the number of copies of that allele divided by the total number of alleles for the gene in the gene pool. A simple example will help you understand these concepts. The data in Table 7.2 represent a population of 100 individuals. For each gene, the gene pool has a total of 200 alleles (2 per individual x 100 individuals). The gene in question exists as two different alleles, A and a. The number of A alleles in the gene pool is 140. Of these, 100 are in the 50 AA homozygotes. Another 40 are in the 40 Aa heterozygotes. The number of a alleles in the gene pool is 60. Of these, 40 are in the 40 Aa heterozygotes. Another 20 are in the 10 aa homozygotes. The frequency of the A allele is 140/200 = 0.7. The frequency of the a allele is 60/200 = 0.3. Genotype AA Aa aa Totals Number of Individuals 50 40 10 100 Number of A Alleles 100 (50 x 2) 40 (40 x 1) 0 (10 x 0) 140 Number of a Alleles 0 (50 x 0) 40 (40 x 1) 20 (10 x 2) 60 Evolution occurs in a population when its allele frequencies change over time. For example, the frequency of the A allele might change from 0.7 to 0.8. If that happens, evolution has occurred. What causes allele frequencies to change? The answer is forces of evolution. There are four major forces of evolution that cause allele frequencies to change. They are mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Mutation creates new genetic variation in a gene pool This is how all new alleles first arise. Its the ultimate source of new genetic variation, so it is essential for evolution. However, for any given gene, the chance of a mutation occurring is very small. Therefore, mutation alone does not have much effect on allele frequencies. Gene flow is the movement of genes into or out of a gene pool It occurs when individuals migrate into or out of the population. How much gene flow changes allele frequencies depends on how many migrants there are and their genotypes. Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequencies. It occurs in small populations. Allele frequencies in the offspring may differ by chance from those in the parents. This is like tossing a coin just a few times.

The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way.

Passage:He was both a Catholic and a royalist, and enjoyed the confidence of Queen Henrietta Maria, who recommended him to Charles I as \\"a man deserving of every encouragement.\\" In 1645 he tried to get the Confederation of Kilkenny to support King Charles I in the English Civil War on the grounds that their demands for full civic rights to be restored to Roman Catholics would be met. He fought with the Confederates against the Parliamentarians in 1645â6, and led a successful assault on Roscommon Castle in 1646. In 1649 he was imprisoned in London but soon released. After some time in France he was allowed to return to England through the pleas of his brother-in-law John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare. He is said to have been one of the few Irishmen whom Oliver Cromwell admired, and was also on good terms with Oliver's son Henry Cromwell, although Henry refused his request to be allowed to recover possession of his principal residence, Merrion Castle. During the Commonwealth he seems to have played a careful double game- his second marriage into the Holles family put him in the Parliamentarian camp, but he was also suspected of working for the Restoration of Charles II.\\n Links: a.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards.

While some critics have noted a feminist perspective in her writing, her popularity has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations against her of child sexual abuse and rape by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland, among many others. Zimmer Bradley's first child, David R. Bradley, and her brother, Paul Edwin Zimmer, also became published science fiction and fantasy authors.\\n\\n- The Darkover series is a science fiction-fantasy chronology consisting of several novels and short stories set in the fictional world of Darkover as created by author Marion Zimmer Bradley. The word \\"Darkover\\" is a registered trademark owned by the Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Works Trust.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Darkover is the focus planet of the Darkover series of science fiction-fantasy novels and short stories by Marion Zimmer Bradley and others published since 1958.

There is much crossover with other subgenres of fantasy; those classes as Arthurian, Celtic, or Dark Ages could just as easily be placed in Historical Fantasy. Stories fitting this classification generally take place prior to the 20th century.\\n\\n- Science fantasy is a mixed genre within the umbrella of speculative fiction which simultaneously draws upon and/or combines tropes and elements from both science fiction and fantasy. It also sometimes incorporates elements of horror fiction.\\n\\n- Andre Alice Norton (born Alice Mary Norton, February 17, 1912Â  March 17, 2005) was an American writer of science fiction and fantasy with some works of historical fiction and contemporary fiction.

The book follows the trajectory of Morgaine (often called Morgan le Fay in other works), a priestess fighting to save her matriarchal Celtic culture in a country where patriarchal Christianity threatens to destroy the pagan way of life. The epic is focused on the lives of Gwenhwyfar, Viviane, Morgause, Igraine and other women who are often marginalized in Arthurian retellings. King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are supporting rather than main characters.\\n\\n- Ace Books is an American specialty publisher of science fiction and fantasy books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn and began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, gothic novels, media tie-in novelizations, and romances. Ace became known for the \\"tÃªte-bÃªche\\" binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this \\"Ace Double\\" format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound \\"tÃªte-bÃªche\\", until 1973.\\n\\n- Spell of the Witch World is a collection of short fiction by science fiction and fantasy author Andre Norton, forming part of her Witch World series. It was first published in paperback by DAW Books in April 1972, and has been reprinted numerous times since. It has the distinction of being the first book released by that publisher. Early printings had cover art and a frontispiece by artist Jack Gaughan; later printings replaced the cover art (but not the frontispiece) with new art by Michael Whelan.

Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\\n\\n- A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that\\nThe term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'the keeper's price' exhibits the relationship of 'series'.

The chicks were fed for 3 weeks a vitamin D-deficient diet but were supplemented with radioactive labeled vitamin D3. The chicks were then divided into two groups. In the first group the right tibia was fractured, whereas the second group served as nonfractured control group. During the following days of fracture healing, the metabolites of [3H]vitamin D3 were measured in callus, epiphysis, diaphysis, plasma, duodenum, and kidney. Histological examination of calluses and bones, measurements of intestinal absorption of calcium, and renal production of dihydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D3 were performed as well. The levels of the dihydroxylated metabolites were increased in the calluses and the levels of [3H]24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were found to coincide with the formation of cartilaginous tissue and with the renal production of this steroid. In the duodenum of the fractured chicks, the levels of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 dropped significantly during the first week after fracture, coinciding with reduction in the intestinal absorption of calcium. In the plasma during those 3 weeks of healing process the levels of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were far below normal.

In Japan, the character bears the title of DaimaâÃ§. In the United States, the character was first referred to as \\"Bowser, King of the Koopa\\" and \\"The sorcerer king\\" in the Super Mario Bros. instruction manual. Bowser is the leader and most powerful of the turtle-like Koopa race, and has been the greedy nemesis of Mario ever since his first appearance, in the game Super Mario Bros. His ultimate goals are to kidnap and marry Princess Peach, defeat Mario, and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom. Since his debut, he has appeared in almost every Mario franchise game, usually serving as the main antagonist. Bowser has been called \\"the most successful video game character\\". Currently, Bowser is voiced by Kenny James. In addition to his usual animated and video game appearances, he was also portrayed by Dennis Hopper in the 1993 critically reviled live-action film, in which he was shown as the crooked and corrupt President/King Koopa, unopposed king and acting president of Dinohattan.","target":"Name the film characters that are of the same rank as [King Koopa]","rationale":"The original question was: \\"Which film characters are of the same rank with [King Koopa]?\\".

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isnât easy, especially for researchers early in their careers.\\nIf you ever have a spare week, or ten, itâs worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/Â£millions.\\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join ânetworksâ and âcommitteesâ discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people â practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\\nCentral to much of the impact is âaccessâ. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

He is the leader of the religious group Nation of Islam (NOI) and served as the minister of major mosques in Boston and Harlem, and was appointed by longtime NOI leader Elijah Muhammad as the National Representative of the Nation of Islam. After Warith Deen Muhammad disbanded the NOI and started the orthodox Islamic group American Society of Muslims, Farrakhan started rebuilding the NOI.\\nContext: In 2008, Farrakhan publicly criticized the United States and supported then-Senator Barack Obama who was campaigning at the time to become the president of the United States of America. Farrakhan and Obama had met at least once before.  The Obama campaign quickly responded to convey his distance from the minister. \\"Senator Obama has been clear in his objections to Farrakhan's past pronouncements and has not solicited the minister's support,\\" said Obama spokesman Bill Burton.

Throughout the band's career, they have released nine full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of styles, including nu metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Fear Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but re-formed a year later without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist.\\nContext: In June 1995, the band participated at the Dynamo Open Air festival in Netherlands.  Fear Factory's second album, Demanufacture, was released on June 12. Generally considered to be the band's defining work, features, in comparison to the overly brutal approach favored in the early recordings, a more industrial metal sound characterized by a mix of rapid fire thrash metal/industrial metal guitar riffs and tight, pulse driven drum beats, roaring (rather than growled, but still aggressive) vocals that made way for melodic singing and powerful bass lines.  The album's production is more refined and the integration of atmospheric keyboard parts and industrial textures upon Cazares' and Herrera's precise musicianship made the songs sound clinical, cold and machine-like and gave the band's music a futuristic feel than the band's previous works. Many fans consider Rhys Fulber's involvement with the band integral to this dimension of their sound. There were extensive contributions from Reynor Diego as well; adding key samples, loops and electronic flourishes to the group dynamics.  Demanufacture was awarded the maximum five-star rating in the UK's Kerrang! rock magazine. It went on to become a fairly successful album; whereas Soul of a New Machine failed to chart anywhere, Demanufacture made the Top 10 of the Billboard Heatseekers charts and a video was produced for the song \\"Replica\\". The video was featured in the Test Drive 5 video game for the PlayStation. The song \\"Zero Signal\\" was featured on the Mortal Kombat film soundtrack (1995). Instrumental versions of Demanufacture songs were later used in PC videogames Carmageddon and Messiah.  Fear Factory spent the next few years touring with such bands Black Sabbath, Megadeth and Iron Maiden, and opened for Ozzy Osbourne in North America and Europe during late 1995. They went on their first headlining European tour in mid-1996, with Manhole and Drain S.T.H. playing in clubs and music festivals, such as With Full Force, Waldrock or Graspop Metal Meeting. They also appeared at the Ozzfest in 1996 and 1997. In early 1997, they participated at the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand. In May 1997, the band released a new album composed of Demanufacture remixes by artists such as Rhys Fulber, DJ Dano or Junkie XL called Remanufacture - Cloning Technology. This was the band's first appearance on the Billboard 200 ;it also appeared on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Roadrunner Records re-released, in a 10th Anniversary single package, Demanufacture and Remanufacture in 2005, which is similar to that of Soul of a New Machine (2004).

Since the sum of these areas is equal to 2(162) + 4(324), we can conclude that 324 = (2)(162). Solving this equation gives us 162 = 8 x 9^3/4, so we can conclude that 162 must be a multiple of both 8 and 9, which means it must be divisible by 72. This means that it cannot also equal 324 because 324 is not divisible by 72. Therefore, our answer is incorrect - it must be either A or B or C or E.

Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke.  On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear.  Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist NiccolÃ² Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.","target":"Palazzo Pitti","rationale":"The article mentioned that Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes.

We fight all the time and as much as I try, I can't make him happy or help him with his anger. He has returned to meth one time since he's been out and it was terrible to watch. He had full-on delusions and wanted to argue you with me over scientific principles that were non-existent. He claimed that all plants have psychedelic properties and that he could make DMT out of the mimosa trees that grow near our house. I found him passed out at the base of a poor tree that had been hacked halfway out of the ground with a garden trowel. He seems to be doing better and has gotten into an outpatient treatment program in the last week. I fear he has some psychological issues that need medication, but I dare not say anything about it to him. Luckily, I work from home and can monitor him while he's here. I moved after his arrest to a more rural area to avoid the drug culture that our old neighborhood was immersed in.

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.\\n\\n- An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.\\n\\n- Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium.

ReykjavÃ­k and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.\\n\\n- Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway.

It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored.\\n\\n- A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.\\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger.

From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were LandsmÃ¥l and RiksmÃ¥l. The LandsmÃ¥l language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as HÃ¸gnorsk (analogous to High German).\\n\\n- Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: JÃ¤mtland, HÃ¤rjedalen and BohuslÃ¤n.\\n\\n- BokmÃ¥l (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk.

He divided opinion among those who knew him, with some loving and others despising him, and during his lifetime, he was often criticised on both scholarly and moral grounds. The archaeologist Max Mallowan asserted that he \\"was a delightful, light-hearted and amusing companion, but those close to him knew that he could be a dangerous opponent if threatened with frustration\\".\\nHis charm offensives were often condemned as being insincere. During excavations, he was known as an authoritarian leader but favoured those who he thought exhibited bravery by standing up to his authority. Hence, he has been termed \\"a benevolent dictator\\". He was meticulous in his writings, and would repeatedly revise and rewrite both pieces for publication and personal letters. Throughout his life, he was a heavy smoker.Wheeler expressed the view that he was \\"the least political of mortals\\". Despite not taking a strong interest in politics, Wheeler was described by his biographer as \\"a natural conservative\\"; for instance, during his youth he was strongly critical of the Suffragettes and their cause of greater legal rights for women. Nevertheless, he was \\"usually happy to advance young women professionally\\", something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them. He expressed little interest in his relatives; in later life, he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties.Wheeler was married three times. In May 1914, Wheeler married Tessa Verney. Tessa became an accomplished archaeologist, and they collaborated until she died in 1936. Their only child, Michael Mortimer Wheeler, was born in January 1915; he became a barrister. Following Tessa's death, in 1939, Wheeler married Mavis de Vere Cole, widow of the prankster Horace de Vere Cole.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

To investigate the possible role of these cells in multiple sclerosis, we used anti-2H4 antibody to characterize peripheral-blood lymphocyte subsets in 63 patients with multiple sclerosis that was progressive, stable, or acute (relapsing-remitting). Twenty-three of 37 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis had a selective decrease in the number and percentage of peripheral-blood T cells that induce suppressor cells (T4+2H4+ cells), whereas only 3 of 16 patients with stable disease and 2 of 10 patients in the midst of an acute attack had a significant decrease. These selective decreases of circulating T4+2H4+ cells occurred in only 1 of 34 patient controls with other neurologic diseases and in 2 of 50 healthy controls (P less than 0.0001 by Fisher's exact test). The absolute number of T4+2H4+ cells and the percentage of reactivity in the populations studied were 187 +/- 28 per cubic millimeter and 8.3 +/- 1 percent in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis; 353 +/- 60 per cubic millimeter and 14.5 +/- 2 percent in patients with stable disease; 368 +/- 72 and 14.6 +/- 2.1 percent in patients with acute disease; 402 +/- 64 and 15.6 +/- 2 percent in controls with other neurologic diseases; and 519 +/- 44 and 19.7 +/- 1 percent in healthy controls. Functional studies using a pokeweed mitogen-driven IgG assay demonstrated a correlation between decreased numbers of T4+2H4+ cells and increased production of IgG in vitro. Family studies showed that the 2H4 antigen was not part of an inherited polymorphic antigenic determinant. Our results suggest that in progressive multiple sclerosis decreases in inducers of suppressor T cells may permit the activation of cells reactive with elements of the central nervous system. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data describing the absolute number and percentage of peripheral-blood T4+2H4+ cells in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis and in healthy controls.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies donât observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP.\\nAs such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization.\\nSadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same âol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens.

Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data that indicate the number of positive, suspicious, and negative FCM results (38; 3; 4), cytology results (3; 9; 13), and biopsy-confirmed recurrences in these instances (35) compared to the total number of examinations performed. It also indicates false-negative rates for both techniques: 19.7% for FCM and 40.9% for conventional cytology.

The Who's 2006 album Endless Wire includes the song \\"God Speaks of Marty Robbins\\". The song's composer, Pete Townshend, explained that the song is about God deciding to create the universe just so he can hear some music, \\"and most of all, one of his best creations, Marty Robbins.\\" The Beasts of Bourbon released a song called \\"The Day Marty Robbins Died\\" on their 1984 debut album The Axeman's Jazz. Both Frankie Laine and Elvis Presley, among others, recorded versions of Robbins' song \\"You Gave Me a Mountain\\", with Laine's recording reaching the pop and adult contemporary charts in 1969. Though Elvis never recorded any of Robbins' songs in the studio, he was a big fan and recorded \\"You Gave Me a Mountain\\" live in concert several times; it appeared on 15 Presley albums. Johnny Cash recorded a version of \\"Big Iron\\" as part of his American Recordings series, which is included in the Cash Unearthed box set. Cash also recorded other songs by Robbins, including \\"I Couldn't Keep From Crying\\", \\"Kate\\" and \\"Song Of The Patriot\\". He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on his network TV show. \\"Big Iron\\" was also covered by Mike Ness on his album Under the Influences, on which he paid homage to country music artists. The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs, gained renewed popularity following its use in the video game .\\n Passage 3:In the spring of 1902, Bulgaria, an Ottoman vassal state which was interested in acquiring Macedonia, signed a military convention with Russia. Late in the fall, Russia, supported by the United Kingdom and France, proposed to the Ottomans political reforms for the Macedonian vilayets. On 8 December, the Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II, signed a decree implementing most of the reforms. In February 1903, the new Russian foreign minister, Vladimir Lamsdorf, visited Vienna and signed the so-called \\"Vienna Program\\" on Macedonian reforms. The program was substantially the same as the Ottoman decree of December. The immediate provocation of a new agreement at MÃ¼rzsteg was the IlindenâPreobrazhenie Uprising that broke out on 2 August. With its quick suppression, the Vienna Program lay dead. In September Tsar Nicholas II of Russia visited the Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary at the latter's castle in MÃ¼rzsteg, Austria. The two rulers put their signatures to a new memorandum, substantially identical to the Vienna Program, which called for the appointment of one Russian and one Austro-Hungarian civil agent to oversee the reform of the administration, judiciary and local gendarmerie in the Macedonian vilayets. In all these institutions Christians were to take part. After Abdul Hamid accepted the proposal in November, Russia appointed one N. Demerik as its agent, and Austria chose one G. MÃ¼ller. They began their work under HÃ¼seyin Hilmi Pasha, the Inspector-General of Macedonia, in early 1904. Under the MÃ¼rzsteg program, each Great Power appointed an advisory official to the Ottoman official in charge of reforming the gendarmerie in each province. Austria-Hungary appointed an advisor to the sanjak of ÃskÃ¼p, Russia to the sanjak of Thessaloniki, France to the sanjak of Siroz and Britain to the sanjak of Drama.","target":"2","rationale":"The question asks for how many years after Robbins originally released \\"Big Iron\\" did Mike Ness cover it.

The Chiefs began the scoring in the game, completing an eight play, fifty-nine yard drive with a thirty-four yard Ryan Succop field goal following three-and-outs by both teams one their respective first possessions of the football game. From there however, the momentum swung heavily in the favour of the Bengals, who would reel off the next twenty-one consecutive points. The Bengals began their run by completing an eleven play, seventy-eight yard drive with a four-yard touchdown pass from sophomore quarterback Andy Dalton, to fellow sophomore receiver AJ Green. The drive, highlighted by two different successful fourth down conversions by the Bengals offensive unit, was seen as a catalyst for the momentum swing that took place by Cincinnati running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis. The touchdown marked the ninth straight game with a receiving score for the second year receiver out of the University of Georgia. The streak, the current longest in the National Football League, also broke the Cincinnati Bengals single-season franchise record for consecutive games with a receiving touchdown.After the teams traded two possessions each that resulted in points for neither team, Cincinnati manifested a five play, fifty-seven yard drive. The drive appeared to culminate on a ten-yard throw from Andy Dalton to third-year tight end Jermaine Gresham, out of the University of Oklahoma. However, upon booth review, Gresham was deemed to have been tackled just within the 1-yard line. Dalton would run the ball in one play later, on a bootleg run to make the score 14-3 in favour of Cincinnati. Following another Kansas City punt, the Bengals continued their onslaught, as their offense engineered an eleven play, seventy-nine yard drive highlighted by runs of twenty-one and seventeen yards respectively by running backs BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Cedric Peerman. The drive was capped off by a one-yard touchdown scamper by Green-Ellis, putting the Bengals ahead by a commanding 21-3 score. Just before the half time break, Kansas City showed signs of life, completing several medium-range passes during a quick seven play, sixty-five yard drive. Place kicker Ryan Succop would be successful on his second attempt of the afternoon, nailing the thirty-three yard field goal, bringing the Chiefs to within a score of 21-6 at half time. After each team was unsuccessful on their respective two possessions in the third quarter of play, Cincinnati would score the final points of the football game on the opening possession of the fourth quarter. Andy Dalton finished off the Bengals twelve play, seventy-two yard drive by hitting rookie receiver Mohamed Sanu, out of Rutgers. The touchdown gave the Bengals a 28-6 advantage which would end up being the final score on the day.With the victory, the Bengals evened their record at 5-5 on the season, pulling to within one game of both the Indianapolis Colts and the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Wildcard playoff race.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"How many total points were scored?","rationale":"Here is an example of a question for the given article: How many total points were scored?"},{"source":"The input is a tweet which can be Hate Speech or Offensive.

Reliable and cost-effective diagnostic tests, along with effective vaccines and vector-control strategies, are highly required to reduce dengue morbidity and mortality. Evaluation studies revealed that many commercially available NS1 antigen (Ag) tests have limited sensitivity to DENV-4 serotype compared to the other three serotypes. These studies indicated the need for development of new NS1 Ag detection test with improved sensitivity to DENV-4. An NS1 capture enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) specific to DENV-4 may improve the detection of DENV-4 cases worldwide. In addition, a serotype-specific NS1 Ag test identifies both DENV and the infecting serotype. Methods: In this study, we used a small-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO*) cloning vector to express a SUMO*-DENV-4 rNS1 fusion protein to develop NS1 DENV-4 specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). These newly developed MAbs were then optimized for use in an anti-NS1 DENV-4 capture ELISA. The serotype specificity and sensitivity of this ELISA was evaluated using (i) supernatants from DENV (1-4)-infected Vero cell cultures, (ii) rNS1s from all the four DENV (1-4) and, (iii) rNS1s of related flaviviruses (yellow fever virus; YFV and West Nile virus; WNV). Results: From the evaluation studies of the newly developed MAbs, we identified three DENV-4 specific anti-NS1 MAbs: 3H7A9, 8A6F2 and 6D4B10. Two of these MAbs were optimal for use in a DENV-4 serotype-specific NS1 capture ELISA: MAb 8A6F2 as the capture antibody and 6D4B10 as a detection antibody. Conclusion: This ELISA was sensitive and specific to DENV-4 with no cross-reactivity to other three DENV (1-3) serotypes and other heterologous flaviviruses. Taken together these data indicated that our MAbs are useful reagents for the development of DENV-4 immunodiagnostic tests. \\n Title: Development and characterization of serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies against the dengue virus-4 (DENV-4) non-structural protein (NS1)","target":"True","rationale":"The title summarizes the main objective of the study (\\"Development and characterization of serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies against the dengue virus-4 (DENV-4) non-structural protein (NS1)\\") and provides additional information about how this was achieved (\\"...immunodiagnostic tests.\\").

Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

She advises the desperate workers not to start a revolution, and instead wait for the arrival of \\"The Mediator\\", who, she says, will unite the two halves of society.

Shocked at the workers' living conditions, he joins her cause.Meanwhile his father Fredersen consults with the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), an old companion and rival. Fredersen learns that the papers found with dead workers are plans of the catacombs and witnesses a speech by Maria. He also learns that Rotwang has built a robotic gynoid.

Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.\\n\\nand the situation: Rob always confuses the terms climate and weather. He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A.

The rise in temperature is caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels which have led to an increase in carbon dioxide levels. Industrialization also resulted in deforestation and loss of vegetation cover that causes global warming too as plants are a major absorber of heat energy from sun due to photosynthesis process hence less vegetation means more heat on earth's surface.\\nThe char C would be warmer than char D because it indicates present time climate which suggests increased level of greenhouse gases resulting into higher temperatures compared to pre-industrial times when there was no such anthropogenic activity and thus lower temperatures (char D)."},{"source":"Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are more or less ):\\n\\nThe pupil automatically gets bigger or smaller to let more or less light in as needed.\\n\\n\\nWhen it is day time the pupils in our eyes are more or less open than normal?","target":"less","rationale":"The pupil is the black circular opening in the middle of our eye.

Georgia Tech played against Notre Dame in 1953 with Wayne Edmonds starting at offensive tackle and defensive end for the Irish. Edmonds was the first black player to win a monogram at Notre Dame. Georgia Tech lost to Notre Dame 27-14.  Georgia Tech also participated in the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers.

Under Edward VI, the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I; even so two radicals were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying Christ's divinity). Under Mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction. When Elizabeth I came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of \\"...a subversive fifth column.\\" The last execution of a \\"heretic\\" in England occurred under James VI and I in 1612.

Later, another Raven fumble allowed Cincinnati to cash in as Bengals kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 23-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, Baltimore's turnover problems continued as QB Steve McNair fumbled the ball as he got sacked, allowing Bengals LB Landon Johnson to return the fumble 34 yards for a touchdown for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Ravens finally took the lead with Stover kicking a 23-yard field goal and Safety Ed Reed returning a punt 63 yards for a touchdown.

When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents, though there is little to support this claim. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).

The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than $500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y.

He started in the Buffalo Bills' season-opener against the New York Jets and recorded three combined tackles, two pass deflections, a sack, and intercepted a pass by Josh McCown in their 21â12 victory. The following week, he collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (seven solo) and three pass deflections during a 9â3 loss at the Carolina Panthers in Week 2. He was inactive for the Bills' Week 8 victory against the Oakland Raiders due to a knee injury. In Week 11, Poyer recorded a season-high eight solo tackles, three assisted tackles, and deflected a pass in the Bills' 54â24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers. On December 24, 2017, Poyer recorded six combined tackles, broke up a pass, an interception, and a touchdown during a 37â16 loss at the New England Patriots in Week 16.

Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join ânetworksâ and âcommitteesâ discussing their research and wider issues.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming.

A variety of algorithms search architectures under different search space. These searched architectures are trained using different setups, e.g., hyper-parameters, data augmentation, regularization. This raises a comparability problem when comparing the performance of various NAS algorithms. NAS-Bench-101 has shown success to alleviate this problem. In this work, we propose an extension to NAS-Bench-101: NAS-Bench-201 with a different search space, results on multiple datasets, and more diagnostic information. NAS-Bench-201 has a fixed search space and provides a unified benchmark for almost any up-to-date NAS algorithms. The design of our search space is inspired by the one used in the most popular cell-based searching algorithms, where a cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph. Each edge here is associated with an operation selected from a predefined operation set. For it to be applicable for all NAS algorithms, the search space defined in NAS-Bench-201 includes all possible architectures generated by 4 nodes and 5 associated operation options, which results in 15,625 neural cell candidates in total. The training log using the same setup and the performance for each architecture candidate are provided for three datasets. This allows researchers to avoid unnecessary repetitive training for selected architecture and focus solely on the search algorithm itself. The training time saved for every architecture also largely improves the efficiency of most NAS algorithms and presents a more computational cost friendly NAS community for a broader range of researchers. We provide additional diagnostic information such as fine-grained loss and accuracy, which can give inspirations to new designs of NAS algorithms. In further support of the proposed NAS-Bench-102, we have analyzed it from many aspects and benchmarked 10 recent NAS algorithms, which verify its applicability.","target":"A NAS benchmark applicable to almost any NAS algorithms","rationale":"A NAS benchmark applicable to almost any NAS algorithms.\\""},{"source":"Given an entity as input, output another entity which is part of the input entity.

From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\".\\n\\n- A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World WarÂ II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- LwÃ³w Voivodeship was an administrative unit of interwar Poland (19181939).

At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c.Â 347Â BC). His writings cover many subjects Â including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and governmentÂ  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343Â BC.\\n\\n- Aleksandr Tuchkin ( born July 15 , 1964 in Lviv , Ukrainian SSR ) is a Russian team handball player and Olympic champion from 2000 in Sydney .

Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles.\\n\\n- Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- A National Olympic Committee (NOC) is a national constituent of the worldwide Olympic movement. Subject to the controls of the International Olympic Committee, NOCs are responsible for organizing their people's participation in the Olympic Games.

A record 197 nations, all current IOC member nations, took part in the Games, comprising 10,318 athletes. The International Olympic Committee voted in 1986 to separate the Summer and Winter Games, which had been held in the same year since 1924, and place them in alternating even-numbered years, beginning in 1994. The 1996 Summer Games were the first to be staged in a different year from the Winter Games. Atlanta became the fifth American city to host the Olympic Games and the third to hold a Summer Olympic Games. \\n\\n- Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.

It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.\\n\\n- Athens (\\"AthÃ­na\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.\\n\\n- A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games.\\n\\n- The West Ukrainian People's Republic was a short-lived republic that existed in late 1918 and early 1919 in eastern Galicia. It included the cities of Lviv, Przemyl, Kolomyia and Stanislaviv (now Ivano-Frankivsk) and claimed parts of Bukovina and Carpathian Ruthenia.

When, after several regional conflicts, the borders of the state were fixed in 1922, Poland's neighbours were Czechoslovakia, Germany, the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and the Soviet Union. It had access to the Baltic Sea via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of Gdynia. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. Despite internal and external pressures, it continued to exist until 1939, when Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Slovak Republic, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. The Second Republic was significantly different in territory to the current Polish state. It included substantially more territory in the east and less in the west.\\n\\n- Daniel of Galicia (1201  1264; : \\"Danylo Romanovych (Halytskyi)\\"; : \\"Daniil Romanovich (Galitsky)\\") was a King of Rus', Prince (Knyaz) of Galicia (\\"Halych\\") (12051255), Peremyshl (1211), and Volodymyr (12121231).

As much as 90 per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism.

Owen Cronin, his grandfather, had had his surname changed from Cronague in 1870.\\n\\nThe Citadel (1937), a tale of a mining company doctor's struggle to balance scientific integrity with social obligations, helped to incite the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom by exposing the inequity and incompetence of medical practice at the time. In the novel Cronin advocated a free public health service in order to defeat the wiles of those doctors who \\"raised guinea-snatching and the bamboozling of patients to an art form.\\" Dr Cronin and Aneurin Bevan had both worked at the Tredegar Cottage Hospital in Wales, which served as one of the bases for the NHS. The author quickly made enemies in the medical profession, and there was a concerted effort by one group of specialists to get The Citadel banned. Cronin's novel, which was the highest-selling book ever published by Victor Gollancz, informed the public about corruption within the medical system, planting a seed that eventually led to reform. Not only were the author's pioneering ideas instrumental in the creation of the NHS, but the historian Raphael Samuel asserted in 1995 that the popularity of Cronin's novels played a substantial role in the Labour Party's landslide victory in 1945.  By contrast, according to one of Cronin's biographers, Alan Davies, the book's reception was mixed. A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to one of its many messages: that a few well-heeled doctors in fashionable practices were ripping off their equally well-off patients. Some pointed to the lack of balance between criticism and praise for hard-working doctors. The majority accepted it for what it was, a topical novel. The press attempted to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy, while Victor Gollancz followed suit in an attempt to promote the book, all overlooking the fact that it was a work of fiction, not a scientific piece of research, and not autobiographical.

Methods: Data of weekly incident RA (2012RA ( -2013 were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance claims database, and those of weekly observations on eight respiratory viral infections were obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database. We estimated the percentage change in incident RA associated with ambient mean respiratory viral infections using a generalized linear model, after adjusting for time trend, air pollution, and meteorological data. Results: A total of 24,117 cases of incident RA (mean age 54.7 years, 18,688 [77.5%] women) were analyzed. Ambient respiratory viral infections in the population were associated with a higher number of incident RA over time, and its effect peaked 6 or 7 weeks after exposure. Among the 8 viruses, parainfluenza virus (4.8% for 1% respiratory viral infection increase, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.1, P = .003), coronavirus (9.2%, 3.9 to 14.8, P < .001), and metapneumovirus (44%, 2.0 to 103.4, P = .038) were associated with increased number of incident RA. The impact of these respiratory viral infections remained significant in women (3.8%, 12.1%, and 67.4%, respectively, P < .05) and in older patients (10.7%, 14.6%, and 118.2%, respectively, P < .05). Conclusions: Ambient respiratory viral infections in the population were associated with an increased number of incident RA, especially in women and older patients, suggesting that respiratory viral infections can be a novel environmental risk factor for the development of RA.","target":"Respiratory viral infections and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis","rationale":"The title should provide evidence for the increased risk of RA due to respiratory viral infections, which is stated in the Background and Methods section.

Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute.\\nMoorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context.\\nSince 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objectsâ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitorâs path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art.

Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life.

Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of âthe everydayâ.\\nTo create a sense of âthe dayâ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others.

Different from graph Fourier transform, graph wavelet transform can be obtained via a fast algorithm without requiring matrix eigendecomposition with high computational cost. Moreover, graph wavelets are sparse and localized in vertex domain, offering high efficiency and good interpretability for graph convolution.

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi.\\n\\nAs Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth Rs6.6 trillion were signed.  The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4-6% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent - the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992-97 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat.  The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.\\n\\nWhat yer was this","target":"2008,","rationale":"From the given context, it is clear that Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state.\\nHe established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth Rs6.6 trillion were signed.

Passage 1:The Akademisches Kunstmuseum (English: Academic Museum of Antiquities ) was founded in 1818 and has one of the largest collections of plaster casts of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures in the world. At this time collections of plaster casts were mainly used in the instruction of students at art academies. They were first used in the instruction of university students in 1763 by Christian Gottlob Heyne at University of GÃ¶ttingen. The Akademisches Kunstmuseum in Bonn was the first of its kind, as at this time collections at other universities were scattered around universities libraries. The first director was Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, who also held a professorship of archaeology. His tenure was from 1819 until his retirement in 1854. He was succeeded by Otto Jahn and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl, who shared the directorship. From 1870 to 1889 Reinhard KekulÃ© von Stradonitz, nephew of the famous organic chemist Friedrich August KekulÃ© von Stradonitz, was the director. In 1872 the museum moved to a new building that was formerly used by the department of anatomy. The building was constructed from 1823 to 1830 and designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Hermann Friedrich Waesemann. Other directors of the museum were Georg Loeschcke (from 1889 to 1912), Franz Winter (from 1912 to 1929), Richard DelbrÃ¼ck (from 1929 to 1940), Ernst Langlotz (from 1944 to 1966), Nikolaus Himmelmann (from 1969 to 1994) and Harald Mielsch (since 1994).

Recent studies revealed the mechanisms by which oxygen is perceived by plant cells. This sensory system partly relies on an oxygen-mediated branch of the N-end rule pathway for protein degradation acting on a specific clade of ethylene responsive transcription factors (ERF-VII). A complementary regulative step is provided by aerobic sequestration of an ERF-VII protein at the plasma membrane and its timely release when hypoxia occurs. Complete absence of oxygen triggers the transient accumulation of reactive hydrogen peroxide and induces an additional set of reactive oxygen species-related genes involved in both signaling and attenuation of oxidative stress. Moreover, temporary hypoxic environments that are built up as consequence of dense cell packing have been demonstrated to trigger cell-fate determination in maize anthers. Similarly, limited oxygen delivery in bulky fruit or tuber tissues growing in aerobic conditions were shown to stimulate anaerobic-like responses. These advances in low-oxygen signaling and its effect on cell development highlight the importance of taking hypoxia into account in agronomical practices as well as in breeding programs.","target":"Molecular elements of low-oxygen signaling in plants","rationale":"The title should be brief but informative, and highlight the main focus of this study.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards.

The neocortex of many species of whale is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids. In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions,  judgement, and theory of mind. Whale spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.\\nBrain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the â or Â¾ exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging 8,000 cubic centimetres (490 in3) and 7.8 kilograms (17 lb) in mature males, in comparison to the average human brain which averages 1,450 cubic centimetres (88 in3) in mature males.

He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \\"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\\". Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial. Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \\"pleasures of the body\\".

These areas, called growth plates , allow the bones to grow longer as the child grows. By the time the child reaches an age of about 18 to 25 years, all of the cartilage in the growth plate has been replaced by bone. This stops the bone from growing any longer. Even though bones stop growing in length in early adulthood, they can continue to increase in thickness throughout life.

Since Tom is 26 and Paul is 16, it can be inferred that Tom already had fully developedbones while Paul did not yet.\\nSince both brothers were into sports but only one gained muscle mass (Tom), this suggests that Tom was able to gain weight because he still had room for his bones to grow thicker with increased activity and exercise like weight lifting whereas Paul would not see any increase in size since his bones no longer could expand further outwards due to lack or absence of cartilage"},{"source":"In this task, you are given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences where the second sentence is missing.

Novel antiviral agents need to be developed to control this situation. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the activities of five broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) against several important swine-origin pathogenic viruses by TCID 50 assay. Plaque reduction assay and cell apoptosis assay were also used to test the activity of the peptides. Protection effect of piscidin against pseudorabies virus (PRV) was also examined in mouse model. Results: Piscidin (piscidin 1), caerin (caerin 1.1) and maculatin (maculatin 1.1) could inhibit PRV by direct interaction with the virus particles in a dose-dependent manner and they could also protect the cells from PRV-induced apoptosis. Among the peptides tested, piscidin showed the strongest activity against PRV. Moreover, in vivo assay showed that piscidin can reduce the mortality of mice infected with PRV.

Passage:John Backus was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, where he studied at Reed College, receiving a BA in 1932. He went on to graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where he did research in nuclear physics at the Radiation Laboratory under Ernest Lawrence. He received an MA in 1936, and a PhD in 1940. In 1945 he was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Southern California, a post he retained until his retirement in 1980. During the early part of his career, his research focussed on gaseous discharges in strong magnetic fields. He was also a musician, trained as a performer on piano, bassoon, clarinet and other woodwinds and received the degree of MMus in conducting from the University of Southern California in 1959. In his later career he turned increasingly to the study of musical acoustics, particularly those of wind instruments and organ pipes. In 1969 he published The Acoustical Foundations of Music, a book which became a standard text for introductory courses in musical acoustics. A second edition appeared in 1977. He received the Silver Medal of the Acoustical Society of America in 1986.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.","target":"team A","rationale":"The given context of the question is that team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'\\n\\nCLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : My friend and I used to be in a romantic relationship, but after breaking up about ten months ago we decided that our friendship was still mutually important and we would continue to be close friends. Part of it was necessity, as we were both still on the lease for the same apartment (we live with other roommates, not just the two of us). That being said, we were honestly very close friends and for the most part things had been fine and even great. \\n\\nA few months ago, he made a few friends at work. Not a problem - itâs great to make new friends. I made new friends as well. Soon after, however, the behavior that Iâm unhappy about began. We would make plans together like normal. However, those plans would sometimes result in two scenarios. \\n\\nFirst scenario: \\nHe would forget (according to him; I honestly donât think it was âintentionalâ either but I canât read minds so who knows?) about the plans he made with me and make new plans with someone. It was usually the same friend that heâd make these new plans with. \\n\\nPersonally, if I were to forget about a plan and accidentally make a new one, I would apologize to the second person and explain that I had already committed to doing something else and either offer to do it another time or ask the first person if they would be willing to do something the three of us depending on the situation. His solution was to just say âsorryâ and continue on with the second plan, leaving me out.\\n\\nSecond scenario: \\nHe would go spend time with that same friend from the first scenario either earlier in the same day or the night before something we had planned to do. That itself isnât a problem at all. Make all the plans with friends you want. However, when I would express concern that he frequently got very drunk when he spent time with this person and we had plans coming up, heâd insist he âwouldnât be drinkingâ or âwouldnât get drunkâ and it would be fine. It turns out, that wasnât usually the case. He would often get drunk and then be so drunk or hungover when he got back that he would have to back out of the plans he had made with me. Sometimes heâd come back hours later than expected and it would be too late regardless of whether he was drunk.\\n\\nWhen I started pointing out that he was doing this, he didnât see a problem with it. He seems to think that because we live in the same apartment, it doesnât matter if we have plans to do something because Iâm just there already. In my opinion, living in the same apartment doesnât mean that youâre spending time with or actively maintaining a friendship with somebody and isnât an excuse for backing out of or refusing to make plans.\\n\\nHis solution to this became rather than making plans with me, telling me âno promisesâ when Iâd invite him to do something. He was saying âno promisesâ that he wouldnât forget about the plans and go out with the other friend instead, or that he didnât want to make a plan in case said other friend asked him later on to do something at the time I had invited him to do something.  \\n\\nLater on, I mentioned Iâd be interested in meeting this friend sometime since they seem to hang out a lot and they sounded interesting. His response was that that wouldnât be possible, because this person didnât like me. I donât know this person, and our only mutual friend is him, so I asked what he said that would make this person not like me. He told me that he didnât say anything, but then later changed his story to say that he didnât actually know what he said at all because he had been drunk. \\n\\nWhen I have a gripe with him, I usually keep it private and only bring it up with him because I think that talking about it with others in most cases would be unwarranted and I donât want friends of mine to form opinions of him, particularly negative ones, through secondhand things rather than from actual interactions they have with him.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, I am the only person that he calls his âfriendâ that he does these things to, and he otherwise acts completely normal with me outside of doing these things. Am I the asshole for being upset about and thinking that him doing this is acting like a poor friend?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning if it was appropriate to be upset with their friend for making plans and then forgetting about them or telling the author that they won't make any plans with them due to other obligations.\\\\nIn the post, the author uses the past tense to describe some of these events as well as relationships that have already ended.

Most professional cooks and seasoned homemakers can handle (pun intended) higher heat than those who rarely expose their hands to high temperatures. In our home, weÃ¢ÂÂve had heated discussions about whether the dishes in the just finished dishwasher are too hot to touch or not. And this is just one example.If you exclude the differences between individuals, using your own handÃ¢ÂÂs heat sensitivity to gauge a temperature range is absolutely possible (as long as a few degrees donÃ¢ÂÂt matter). It takes time and practice - which is usually described as Ã¢ÂÂexperienceÃ¢ÂÂ. I personally donÃ¢ÂÂt think in Ã¢ÂÂdegreesÃ¢ÂÂ though, but more in categories like Ã¢ÂÂtoo coldÃ¢ÂÂ / Ã¢ÂÂshould be okÃ¢ÂÂ / Ã¢ÂÂtoo hotÃ¢ÂÂ and a few steps in between. So in short, if you need a precise temperature, get a thermometer. If you are still working on judging by hand, either get a thermometer or plan a few trial-and-error loops.

Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain.\\nProblem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.\\nI chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as Iâve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess.

It developed in the early 18th century in Paris, France as a reaction against the grandeur, symmetry, and strict regulations of the previous Baroque style, especially of the Palace of Versailles, until it was redone. Rococo artists and architects used a more jocular, florid, and graceful approach to the Baroque. Their style was ornate and used light colours, asymmetrical designs, curves, and gold. Unlike the political Baroque, the Rococo had playful and witty themes. The interior decoration of Rococo rooms was designed as a total work of art with elegant and ornate furniture, small sculptures, ornamental mirrors, and tapestry complementing architecture, reliefs, and wall paintings.\\n\\n- Oath of the Horatii ( French : Le Serment des Horaces ) , is a large painting by the French artist Jacques - Louis David painted in 1784 and now on display in the Louvre in Paris . The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public , and remains one of the best known paintings in the Neoclassical style . It depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a dispute between two warring cities , Rome and Alba Longa , and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self - sacrifice for one 's country . Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war , they agree to choose three men from each city ; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city . From Rome , three brothers from a Roman family , the Horatii , agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of Alba Longa , the Curiatii . The three brothers , all of whom appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome , are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them . Of the three Horatii brothers , only one shall survive the confrontation . However , it is the surviving brother who is able to kill the other three fighters from Alba Longa : he chases the three fighters , causing them to separate from each other , and then , in turn , kills each Curiatii brother . Aside from the three brothers depicted , David also represents , in the bottom right corner , a woman crying whilst sitting down . She is Camilla , a sister of the Horatii brothers , who is also betrothed to one of the Curiatii fighters , and thus she weeps in the realisation that , in any case , she will lose someone she loves . The principal sources for the story behind David 's Oath are the first book of Livy ( sections 24 - 6 ) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his Roman Antiquities . However , the moment depicted in David 's painting is his own invention . It grew to be considered a paragon of neoclassical art. The painting increased David 's fame , allowing him to take on his own students .\\n\\n- The Louvre or the Louvre Museum is the world's largest museum and a historic monument in Paris, France. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). Nearly 35,000Â objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square metres (782,910 square feet). The Louvre is the world's second most visited museum after the Palace Museum in China, receiving more than 9.26 million visitors in 2014.\\n\\n- Jacques-Louis David (30 August 1748  29 December 1825) was a French painter in the Neoclassical style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era. In the 1780s his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward a classical austerity and severity, heightened feeling harmonizing with the moral climate of the final years of the \\"Ancien RÃ©gime\\".\\n\\n- In the ancient Roman legend of the kingdom era, the Horatii were triplet warriors who lived during the reign of Tullus Hostilius. The accounts of their epic clash with the Curiatii and the murder of their sister by Publius, the sole survivor of the battle, appear in the writings of Livy.\\n\\n- Titus Livius (64 or 59 BCAD 17)known as Livy in Englishwas a Roman historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people  \\"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\\" (\\"Books from the Foundation of the City\\")  covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own time. He was on familiar terms with the Julio-Claudian dynasty, advising Augustus's grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, as a young man not long before 14 AD in a letter to take up the writing of history. Livy and Augustus's wife, Livia, were from the same clan in different locations, although not related by blood.\\n\\n- History painting is a genre in painting defined by its subject matter rather than artistic style. History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait. The term is derived from the wider senses of the word \\"historia\\" in Latin and Italian, meaning \\"story\\" or \\"narrative\\", and essentially means \\"story painting\\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from history, especially paintings from before about 1850. In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings. \\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.

Condensation is the change of state from a gas to a liquid.\\n\\n\\nQ: What is the change of state from a gas to a liquid?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- vaporation\\n\\n- combustion\\n\\n- fermentation\\n\\n- condensation\\n\\nA:","target":"condensation","rationale":"The paragraph describes how the water from an open container eventually disappears. This is because some of the molecules escape into gas phase and become vapor, a process known as evaporation or vaporization depending on whether it occurs below/above its boiling point respectively.

In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini.

It is part of the Lutheran branch of Christianity.\\n\\n- The Oulu Cathedral ( Finnish : Oulun tuomiokirkko ) is an Evangelical Lutheran cathedral and the seat of the Diocese of Oulu , located in the centre of Oulu , Finland . The church was built in 1777 as a tribute to the King of Sweden Gustav III of Sweden and named after his wife as Sofia Magdalena 's church . The wooden structures burned in the large fire of the city of Oulu in 1822 . The church was built again on top of the old stonewalls with famous architect Carl Ludvig Engel as the designer . The restoration works were completed in 1832 , but the belfry was not erected until 1845 .\\n\\n- The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.\\n\\n- A cathedral (French: \\"cathÃ©drale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathÃ©dra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.\\n\\n- A cathedra (Latin, \\"chair\\", from Greek,  \\"kathÃ©dra\\", \\"seat\\") or bishop's throne is the seat of a bishop. It is a symbol of the bishop's teaching authority in the Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion churches. \\"Cathedra\\" is the Latin word for a chair with armrests, and it appears in early Christian literature in the phrase \\"\\"cathedrae apostolorum\\"\\", indicating authority derived directly from the apostles; its Roman connotations of authority reserved for the Emperor were later adopted by bishops after the 4th century. A church into which a bishop's official \\"cathedra\\" is installed is called a cathedral.\\n\\n- The Diocese of Oulu is a diocese within the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. The diocese was first founded in the town of Kuopio in 1851, but the episcopal see was moved to Oulu in 1900.\\n\\n- The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27Â billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.\\n\\n- Gustav III ( 29 March 1792) was King of Sweden from 1771 until his assassination in 1792. He was the eldest son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Queen Louise Ulrika (a sister of King Frederick the Great of Prussia), and a first cousin of Empress Catherine the Great of Russia by reason of their common descent from Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin, and his wife Albertina Frederica of Baden-Durlach.\\n\\n- A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).\\n\\n- Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp-Eutin (11 January 1673  24 April 1726) was a cadet of the reigning ducal House of Holstein-Gottorp who became prince of Eutin, prince-bishop of LÃ¼beck and regent of the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp.\\n\\n- Duomo is a term for an Italian cathedral church. The formal Italian word for a church that is now a cathedral is \\"cattedrale\\"; a \\"duomo\\" may be either a present or a former cathedral (the latter always in a town that no longer has a bishop nor therefore a cathedral, as for example Trevi).

For example, reading is a way of gaining knowledge in different areas. It can help us have a great imagination, and it makes things easier when it comes to making compositions on different themes. It gives you the possibility to speak about science, even if you don't work in this field. You can express your opinions about a political event because you have read something about that.\\nSecondly, reading gives us the possibility to enter the world of imagination. We can imagine what life will be like in the future. Sometimes, we compare ourselves with the people in the stories we read and they can give us some clues to solve the problems and tell us what to do in certain situations. Books are based on real life. Even if writers are considered to be somehow different from common people, they often face the same problems as we all do.\\nIn short, I would like to say that literature is the perfect way of enriching our culture, expressing correctly, having a rich vocabulary, being able to understand different fields and really being considered to be a learned person.\\nQuestion: In the author's opinion, a person has many books at home only to   _  .\\nOptions: A: make his house look more beautiful\\nB: show that his father is a learned person\\nC: impress others with the fact that he loves reading\\nD: show that he is rich enough to collect many books","target":"C","rationale":"The author states that simply having books doesn't mean a person is actually interested in reading.

The album included cover versions of country music standards, such as Hank Williams' \\"You Win Again,\\" Loretta Lynn's \\"You Ain't Woman Enough,\\" and Kris Kristofferson's \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night.\\" To make the album fit its older style, McBride and her husband hired older Nashville session players and outdated analog equipment. The album sold over 250,000 copies within its first week, the highest sales start for a McBride album. The lead single, a cover of Lynn Anderson's \\"(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden\\", went to number 18 on the country charts, but the other two singles both failed to make top 40.  In 2006, McBride served as a guest coach on Canadian Idol. The remaining five finalists traveled to Nashville, where McBride worked with the competitors on the songs they had chosen by country artists such as Gordon Lightfoot and Patsy Cline. Among the other guest judges that year were Nelly Furtado and Cyndi Lauper. McBride later joined Canadian Idol on a tour in the Spring. In 2007, McBride also served as a guest coach on Fox Networks television series, American Idol.  In 2007, McBride released her ninth studio album, Waking Up Laughing. It was the first album in which McBride co-wrote some of the tracks. She set up her Waking Up Laughing Tour in 2007, which included country artists Rodney Atkins, Little Big Town, and Jason Michael Carroll. The album's lead single, \\"Anyway\\", went to No. 5 on the Billboard Country Chart, becoming her first Top 10 hit since 2003. She also lent her voice singing \\"Anyway\\" in a Lifetime movie called, \\"A Life Interrupted\\" which premiered on April 23, 2007. Its follow-up, \\"How I Feel\\", reached the Top 15. In Spring 2008, McBride released Martina McBride: Live In Concert, a CD/DVD set. It was taped in Moline, Illinois in September 2007.  In July 2007, The ABC Television Network announced a special program called Six Degrees of Martina McBride where individuals from around the country were challenged to find their way to McBride on their own connections and research using a maximum of six methods. The \\"winner\\" of this challenge eventually located a direct connection to McBride through her husband, John, who knew someone, who knew someone else.

Experimental evidence suggests that RV failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. LV failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient. Because RV function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle, this contribution is reduced during LV failure. Treatment should be aimed first at restoring LV function. If RV failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem, treatment of RV failure should be commenced. If volume loading, inotropes, and pH adjustments do not result in adequate RV output, a mechanical assist device should be considered. RHBP is the most powerful device, and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual RV function. Clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved RV function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment, allowing them to be weaned from assist. However, this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention. PABC is a simple but less powerful assist device. Experimental studies suggest that if RV function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--PABC may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels. Current results suggest that RHBP remains the gold standard for severe RV failure, but further clinical experience with PABC may more clearly define its role in the management of RV failure.","target":"Heart Failure, Congestive","rationale":"The title of the article is \\"Management of right ventricular failure in patients with left ventricular failure.\\" The abstract provides information about right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) failure, including their symptoms, causes, and treatments.

A leader in developing the mathematical basis of population genetics and evolutionary theory, he pioneered the application of techniques from molecular biology, such as gel electrophoresis, to questions of genetic variation and evolution. In a pair of seminal 1966 papers co-authored with J.L. Hubby in the journal Genetics, Lewontin helped set the stage for the modern field of molecular evolution. In 1979 he and Stephen Jay Gould introduced the term \\"spandrel\\" into evolutionary theory.\\n\\nAlong with others, such as Gould, Lewontin has been a persistent critic of some themes in neo-Darwinism. Specifically, he has criticised proponents of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology such as Edward O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins, who attempt to explain animal behaviour and social structures in terms of evolutionary advantage or strategy. He and others criticize this approach when applied to humans, as he sees it as genetic determinism. In his writing, Lewontin suggests a more nuanced view of evolution is needed, which requires a more careful understanding of the context of the whole organism as well as the environment.  Such concerns about what he views as the oversimplification of genetics has led Lewontin to be a frequent participant in debates, and an active life as a public intellectual. He has lectured widely to promote his views on evolutionary biology and science. In books such as Not in Our Genes (co-authored with Steven Rose and Leon J. Kamin) and numerous articles, Lewontin has questioned much of the claimed heritability of human behavioral traits, such as intelligence as measured by IQ tests.  Some academics have criticized him for rejecting sociobiology for non-scientific reasons. Edward Wilson (1995) suggested that Lewontin's political beliefs affected his scientific view. Robert Trivers described Lewontin as \\"...a man with great talents who often wasted them on foolishness, on preening and showing off, on shallow political thinking and on useless philosophical rumination while limiting his genetic work by assumptions congenial to his politics.\\" Lewontin has at times identified himself as Marxist, and admitted that his ideological views have affected his scientific work (Levins and Lewontin 1985). Others such as Kitcher (1985) have countered that Lewontin's criticisms of sociobiology are genuine scientific concerns about the discipline. He wrote that attacking Lewontin's motives amounts to an ad hominem argument.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Richard Lewontin","rationale":"From reading the given context, it is clear that all of the text is about Richard Lewontin.

According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.

Ryu tries to donate one of his kidneys to his sister but is told that his blood type does not match that of his sister and so is not a suitable donor. After being laid off from his job by the factory boss, Ryu contacts a black market organ dealer who agrees to sell him a kidney suitable for his sister in exchange for 10,000,000 Korean won, plus one of Ryu's own kidneys. He takes the severance pay from his factory job and offers the money to the organ dealers, who take the money and one of his kidneys, but then disappear. Three weeks later, Ryu learns from his doctor that a kidney has been found for his sister and that the operation will cost 10,000,000 won, but since the organ dealers stole his money, he will not be able to pay for it.In need of money for the operation and in retaliation for his being fired, Ryu and his girlfriend, Yeong-mi (Doona Bae), a radical anarchist, conspire to kidnap the daughter of the boss who fired him. Instead, he realizes that the kidnapping would immediately put them under police suspicion, and they decide to kidnap Yu-sun (Bo-bae Han), the daughter of the boss's friend, Park Dong-jin (Kang-ho Song), another factory executive. The girl stays with Ryu's sister (thinking that Ryu is merely babysitting for a time), who takes care of her while the distraught Dong-jin arranges to pay her ransom. After Ryu collects the money and returns home, he learns that his sister has discovered his scheme and, unwilling to be involved or burden Ryu further, killed herself. Ryu takes Yu-sun and his sister's body into the countryside to bury her by a riverbed they used to frequent as children. While Ryu mourns, Yu-sun accidentally slips into the river and drowns.Days later, as Dong-jin mourns his daughter and swears revenge at the river bank, Ryu ambushes and murders the organ dealers. Dong-jin, having investigated the identities of the kidnappers, finds Yeong-mi and begins interrogating her. Yeong-mi apologizes for Yu-sun's death but warns him of her membership in a terrorist organization that, knowing Dong-jin's identity, will kill him if she dies. Dong-jin, unfazed by the threats, tortures her to death by electrocuting her. Ryu returns to Yeong-mi's apartment building and discovers the police removing her body on a stretcher. Ryu, consumed with grief, swears vengeance on Dong-jin.Ryu arrives at Dong-jin's residence in an attempt to kill him. He waits for some time, but Dong-Jin does not arrive: he is, in fact, waiting at Ryu's apartment. After Dong-Jin does not arrive, Ryu returns to his apartment. However, Dong-jin had previously set up an electric booby trap on his doorknob, which renders Ryu unconscious. Dong-jin then binds Ryu and returns him to the riverbed where Yu-sun died. After binding Ryu's hands and feet and bringing him chest-high into the water, an emotional Dong-jin acknowledges that although Ryu is a good man, he has no choice; Dong-jin then slashes Ryu's Achilles tendons, resulting in his drowning.Dong-jin drags Ryu back to shore and then drives off to a desolate location to bury the body. Once there, he begins to dig a hole, but soon a group of men arrives. They surround and stab Dong-jin repeatedly, finally attaching a note to his chest identifying themselves as the terrorist group of which Yeong-mi was part.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time.

In order to deploy DNN algorithms efficiently on edge or mobile devices, a series of DNN compression algorithms have been explored, including the line of works on factorization methods. Factorization methods approximate the weight matrix of a DNN layer with multiplication of two or multiple low-rank matrices. However, it is hard to measure the ranks of DNN layers during the training process. Previous works mainly induce low-rank through implicit approximations or via costly singular value decomposition (SVD) process on every training step. The former approach usually induces a high accuracy loss while the latter prevents DNN factorization from efficiently reaching a high compression rate. In this work, we propose SVD training, which first applies SVD to decompose DNN's layers and then performs training on the full-rank decomposed weights. To improve the training quality and convergence, we add orthogonality regularization to the singular vectors, which ensure the valid form of SVD and avoid gradient vanishing/exploding. Low-rank is encouraged by applying sparsity-inducing regularizers on the singular values of each layer. Singular value pruning is applied at the end to reach a low-rank model. We empirically show that SVD training can significantly reduce the rank of DNN layers and achieve higher reduction on computation load under the same accuracy, comparing to not only previous factorization methods but also state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.","target":"Efficiently inducing low-rank deep neural networks via SVD training with sparse singular values and orthogonal singular vectors","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nEfficiently inducing low-rank deep neural networks via SVD training with sparse singular values and orthogonal singular vectors."},{"source":"In this task, you are provided with an article of the legal acts.

The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689.

Due to Muslim successes in the Holy Land, the Order sought new missions in Europe. Duke Konrad I of Masovia in west-central Poland appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Prussians in 1226. After the subjugation of the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights fought against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians in the Battle of Saule in 1236, coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia, the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order, allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region. Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253, hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders' attacks, which it did not. The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue pagan Lithuania, which officially converted to  Christianity in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the 11-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. However, even after the country was officially converted, the crusades continued up until the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, when the Lithuanians and Poles, helped by the Tatars, Moldovans and the Czechs, defeated the Teutonic knights. The Teutonic Order's attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia , an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, accompanied the Northern Crusades. One of the major blows for the idea of the conquest of Russia was the Battle of the Ice in 1242. With or without the Pope's blessing, Sweden also undertook several crusades against Orthodox Novgorod.\\n\\nWhat happened first, the Battle of the Ice or Battle of Grunwald?","target":"Battle of Grunwald","rationale":"We first need to find out when the Battle of Grunwald happened.

Current therapeutic strategies, which are all directed towards lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP), do not stop progression of the disease. We have demonstrated that recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene delivery of a form of erythropoietin with attenuated erythropoietic activity (EpoR76E) can preserve retinal ganglion cells, their axons, and vision without decreasing IOP. The goal of this study was to determine if modulation of neuroinflammation or oxidative stress played a role in the neuroprotective activity of EPO.R76E.', 'Five-month-old DBA/2J mice were treated with either rAAV.EpoR76E or a control vector and collected at 8 months of age. Neuroprotection was assessed by quantification of axon transport and visual evoked potentials. Microglia number and morphology and cytokine and chemokine levels were quantified. Message levels of oxidative stress-related proteins were assessed.', 'Axon transport and visual evoked potentials were preserved in rAAV.EpoR76E-treated mice. The number of microglia was decreased in retinas from 8-month-old rAAV.EpoR76E-treated mice, but proliferation was unaffected. The blood-retina barrier was also unaffected by treatment. Levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines were decreased in retinas from rAAV.EpoR76E-treated mice including IL-1, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, CCL4, and CCL5. TNFÎ± messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased in retinas from 8-month-old mice compared to 3-month-old controls regardless of treatment.
