Reconstruction after the war gave Norway the highest economic growth in Europe until 1950, partly created through rationing private consumption allowing for higher industrial investments. The Labor Party retained power throughout the period and maintained a policy of public planning. The University of Bergen was created in 1946. The 1950s saw a boom in construction of hydroelectricity and the state built the steel mill Norsk Jernverk and two aluminum works.

To understand the elements of the periodic table better he categorized them into three groups, cat A, cat B, and cat C. In cat A he placed all the elements with atomic numbers lower than 83. In cat B he put the elements with atomic numbers from 83 to 94. Finally, in cat C he placed the elements with atomic numbers over 94. He found it easier to see their differences after he categorized them.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 82 each have at least one stable isotope (except for technetium, element 43 and promethium, element 61, which have no stable isotopes). Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our Solar System. At over 1.9×1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements.

However, the association still lacks population-based evidence which critically promotes translation from basic research to clinical and preventive practice. Here, we aimed to explore the association in a general population of China.   \\n METHODS From January to May 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional study in 2,498 participants aged above 30 years, residing in Gusu district of Suzhou. Serum soluble corin and blood pressure were measured.   \\n RESULTS Hypertensive participants had a higher level of serum corin than nonhypertensive participants (median (interquartile range): 1,836.83 (1,497.85-2,327.87) pg/ml vs. 1,579.14 (1,322.18-1,956.82) pg/ml, P < 0.001). Higher serum corin was positively associated with prevalent hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 2.01, P < 0.001). In the multiple analysis, participants in the third (OR = 1.43, P = 0.007) and fourth (OR = 1.96, P < 0.001) quartiles had significantly increased odds of hypertension compared to those in the lowest quartile of serum corin. ORs of hypertension positively and significantly increased with serum corin levels (P for trend <0.001). Further subgroup analysis showed that ORs of hypertension associated with high corin (over the median level of serum corin: 1,689.20 pg/ml) were still significant in subgroups by age, body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose (all P < 0.05).   \\n CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that hypertensive participants had an increased serum corin level compared to those without hypertension.

His father was a physician who served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.\\n\\nAmbrose was the lone historian featured in the 1973-74 ITV television series, The World at War, which detailed the history of World War II.  He served as the historical consultant for the movie Saving Private Ryan. Tom Hanks, who starred in the movie, said he \\"pored over D-Day\\" and Band of Brothers in researching his role. Hanks also credited Ambrose's books with providing extensive detail, particularly regarding D-Day landings.  The HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers (2001), for which he was an executive producer, helped sustain the fresh interest in World War II that had been stimulated by the 50th anniversary of D-Day in 1994 and the 60th anniversary in 2004. Ambrose served as executive producer for Price for Peace, a documentary concerning the war in the Pacific theater during World War II, and for Moments of Truth, a TV documentary containing interviews with World War II veterans.  In addition, Ambrose served as a commentator for Lewis & Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery, a documentary by Ken Burns. He provided commentary in twenty made-for TV documentaries, covering diverse topics, such as World War II, Lewis & Clark, and America's prominence in the 20th century. He also appeared as a guest on numerous TV programs or stations, including The Charlie Rose Show, C-Span programming, CNN programming, NBC's Today Show, CNBC's Hardball, and various programming on The History Channel and the National Geographic Channel. Ambrose's association with National Geographic stemmed, in part, from his designation as an Explorer-in-Residence by the Society.  In addition to his academic work and publishing, Ambrose operated a historical tour business, acting as a tour guide to European locales of World War II.

Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.\\nIn late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that..., what would be the answer ?","target":"Edward","rationale":"The question asks for the first name of a person.

Afterwards, the Browns' offense exploded as quarterback Brady Quinn completed a 59-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi, a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chansi Stuckey, and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Detroit would answer with quarterback Matthew Stafford completing a 26-yard touchdown pass to running back Aaron Brown. The Lions would tie the game in the second quarter as Stafford hooked up with running back Kevin Smith on a 25-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 75-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson.

The Lions would take over, and with no time left, Browns safety Brodney Pool intercepted the ball. However, cornerback Hank Poteat was flagged for pass interference in the end zone.

Passage 1:She was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and was graduated from Vassar College in 1949. In 1950, she married Tobin Armstrong and moved to Kenedy County, Texas. From 1966 to 1968, she was the vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party. From 1971 to 1973 she was Co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, and she was the keynote speaker at the 1972 Republican National Convention. (She was the first woman from either major party to keynote at a national convention). Nixon named her as Counselor to the President on 19 December 1972, which she held from January 19, 1973 to November 1974 under President Ford. During her tenure as Counselor, Armstrong founded the first Office of Women's Programs in the White House, predecessor to the current White House Council on Women and Girls. Fluent in Spanish, she was Nixon's liaison to Hispanic Americans and was a member of a Cabinet committee on opportunities for Spanish-speaking people. In 1973, a young Karl Rove, then on his way to becoming the chairman of the College Republicans, suggested in a memorandum to Armstrong that the Republican Party show nonpolitical films (such as John Wayne movies and Reefer Madness) at College Republican clubs as part of a strategy to raise support for the party among students and for fundraising.\\n Passage 2:In 2005, Campbell followed his former manager, Robert Reilly, to Somerset Park and in his first season he made 23 appearances in all competitions. In his second season, Campbell was a first team regular making another 21 appearances. In Campbell's third season he only featured in 12 games, due to injury, which unfortunately was not the last time he had missed large parts of a campaign due to injury. The 2008-09 season was far more successful for Campbell, with him racking up 37 appearances and scoring his first competitive goal for the club in a 3-0 away win over Arbroath. In January 2009, Campbell was struck by Kilmarnock's David Fernandez in an Ayrshire derby that was being shown on Sky Sports. Campbell was instrumental to the club's success and played in all of the club's play-off games as the Honest Men secured promotion back to the First Division. The following season, Ayr finished bottom and Campbell played in 28 matches, and Campbell was initially released at the end of the season, before being offered a trial during pre-season by then manager, Brian Reid, who then offered him a new deal, which he signed. Campbell was once again instrumental to the club's success throughout the 2010-11 campaign, playing 36 times and scoring another goal, this time in the Challenge Cup against Cowdenbeath, as well as featuring in Ayr's famous victory over Hibernian in the Scottish Cup and in all of the club's play-off games, which saw Ayr promoted back to the First Division. The 2011-12 season was more difficult for Campbell as he only featured 13 times, missing most of Ayr's impressive cup runs. Despite a disappointing season before, new manager Mark Roberts kept Campbell at the club on a pay-as-you-play basis and Campbell only went on to play in four matches. The next season saw Campbell's name return to the team sheets more regularly, featuring a total of 21 times. The 2014-15 season was a disastrous campaign for Ayr, however towards the end of the year, Ayr United intended on honouring Campbell with a testimonial.\\n Passage 3:Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the film was \\"kind of sweet and kind of goofy, and works because its heart is in the right place\\".

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money.

The musicians recruited drummer Craig Gill in 1986, when Gill was 14 years old. In 1987, following the departures of Chesworth and Feeley, the line-up included first Mark Hughes, then Dave Swift on bass and organist Clint Boon (whose Ashton-under-Lyne studio the band had been using for rehearsals). The band released two albums worth of demos in the 1980s, Waiting for Ours and Songs of Shallow Intensity, including songs that would later be re-recorded.  They came to prominence, alongside bands like The Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, in the 'Madchester' scene of the late 1980s. After a flexi-disc featuring \\"Garage Full of Flowers\\" given free with Manchester's Debris magazine in 1987, followed by the Cow cassette, their first release proper, the 1988 Planecrash EP on the Playtime label received much airplay from Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who asked the band to record a session for his show. The band reworked their single \\"Find Out Why\\" as the theme tune to the 8:15 from Manchester.  As their popularity grew, Playtime's distributor Red Rhino Records went bankrupt, leading the band to form their own label, Cow Records in March 1989, the label's first release being the Trainsurfing EP. But with half of the first album, Life, written, Holt and Swift departed and formed The Rainkings, so the band recruited Too Much Texas singer Tom Hingley and Martin \\"Bungle\\" Walsh of The Next Step to replace them. Martyn Walsh became the band's thirteenth bass player. After a handful of singles on their own label, the last of which, \\"Move\\", came close to the UK top 40, they signed a deal with Mute Records, and immediately had their first top 40 chart success in the UK with \\"This Is How It Feels\\".

The following year's The Beast Inside was less well received by critics, but still achieved a top 5 album chart placing. The \\"Caravan\\" and \\"Please be Cruel\\" singles only reached No. 30 and No. 50 respectively, and an attempt to crack the American market largely failed. The band did, however, gain a strong following in Portugal, Germany, and Argentina, with the band's 1992 album Revenge of the Goldfish becoming their most successful in those countries.

It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed. When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \\"Dunstable, New Hampshire\\" was renamed \\"Nashua\\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \\"Indian Head\\". Six years later Nashua split into \\"Nashville\\" and \\"Nashua\\", but in 1853 they rejoined and became the \\"City of Nashua\\".

Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge.

He avoided the Vietnam War military draft by taking methamphetamine to fail his draft physical.  Following his work in St. Louis, Ramis returned to Chicago, where by 1968, he was a substitute teacher at schools serving the inner-city Robert Taylor Homes.

It's described on its website as a place that \\"combines classy and affordable craft cocktails and pizza, in a setting welcoming to all.\\". They also host live jazz, hip hop and DJs in the evening a few nights a week. It's a tiny place with maybe 12 tables and a few bar seats and tall bar tables. The whole place holds maybe 60 people.  There is no real stage, just a clearing for the band.\\n\\nWe got there late and sat at the bar which is to the side of where they had set up the band. Most people were focused on the music but some of the tables had people chatting through the evening. Many people eating dinner everyone drinking. So my friend and I are chatting, loud enough to hear each other because the music was loud but trying to be quiet enough so as not to disturb those around us. \\n\\nThe band is instrumental jazz, much of it kinda rocking. But then they get to this quiet slow piece and towards the end the guy next to us leans over and said \\"nobody else is talking. can you guys stop talking just during this song?\\" We did stop talking and the song ended like 10 seconds later.\\n\\nThe place was a cafe with a band placed at a clearing in the corner. This wasnt a theater or even a real music venue. This wasnt a ticketed concert although there was $5 cover at the door.  They serve a full dinner menu. \\n\\nWas I the asshole for talking while the band was playing a quiet piece? Again we were talking quietly, but the guy right next to us could probably hear us.

They were seated at the bar, where there was more ambient noise and people chatting than in other areas of the venue. The band was playing loud enough to be heard over the general noise level, but not so loud as to drown it out completely. The author's friend had chosen this particular venue because they wanted to hear live music while enjoying a meal with friends, which is exactly what they did.\\\\nHowever, the man sitting next to them asked them to stop talking during a quiet piece of music that the band was playing because nobody else was talking at that time. The author understandably felt offended by this man's request and interpreted it as an attack on their right get enjoyment from spending time with friends in public places where some degree of ambient noise is expected.\\\\nIn summary: It seems like neither party is wrong here; although it would have been polite for the man next door to wait until after the song ended before asking them politely if they could keep things quiet for just a few minutes (as others also may have been preparing to order food or drinks), he has every right not only attend concerts/performances but also choose venues where he can enjoy live music without being disturbed by excessive chatter nearby. At the same time, however, it seems reasonable for patrons at a restaurant/bar with live jazz bands performing in one corner (and not on stage) who are seated away from tables near the band clearing should be able expect that some level of background chatter will be present throughout their dining experience and be able tolerate some amount of additional volume from these patrons if necessary.\\"\\n},{\\n\\"id\\":1,\\"user_id\\":1,\\"post_content\\":\\"I am an Uber driver .

The 1928 Games were the first true \\"Winter Olympics\\" held on its own as they were not in conjunction with a \\"Summer Olympics\\".

Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS).

Anders Haugen was the first - and as of 2016 , only - American to win an Olympic medal for ski jumping . Anders Olsen Haugen was born in Bø in Telemark , Norway . Anders Haugen and his brother Lars emigrated to the United States in 1909 and built a ski jumping hill with the Milwaukee Ski Club near Lake Nagawicka west of Milwaukee , Wisconsin , in order to open ski jumping to the public of the area . In 1911 Anders Haugen set a world record of 46m ( 152 feet ) on Curry Hill in Ironwood , Michigan while winning the National Championship .

The bronze medal had been awarded to Norwegian skier Thorleif Haug , who also won three gold medals in the first Winter Olympics in Chamonix . On 12 September 1974 , Anders Haugen came to Norway as an 86 - year - old and was given the bronze medal by Anna Maria Magnussen , Thorleif Haug 's youngest daughter . In 1929 , Haugen and his brother Lars moved to the Lake Tahoe area in California , where he developed the Lake Tahoe Ski Club . Up until his 70s , he directed the junior skiing program at the ski club . Haugen was elected to the Colorado Ski and Snowboard Hall of...\\n\\n- Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games).\\n\\n- The 1924 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris, France. It was the second time Paris hosted the games, after 1900. The selection process for the 1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids, and Paris was selected ahead of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Prague, and Rome. The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921.\\n\\n- A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate.\\n\\n- Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).\\n\\n- The Nordic Games was the first international multi-sport event that focused primarily on winter sports, and was held at varying intervals between 1901 and 1926. It was organized by Swedens Central Association for the Promotion of Sports, and more specifically by Viktor Balck, a member of that association and one of the five original members of the International Olympic Committee. It was, in many ways, a precursor to the modern Winter Olympic Games, whose success was a contributing factor (along with the social and economic turmoil following World War I) to the Nordic Games's discontinuation in the 1920s.\\n\\n- Holmenkollbakken is a large ski jumping hill located at Holmenkollen in Oslo, Norway. It has a hill size of HS134, a construction point of K-120, and a capacity for 70,000 spectators. Holmenkollen has hosted the Holmenkollen Ski Festival since 1892, which since 1980 have been part of the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and 1983 the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup. It has also hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1930, 1966, 1982 and 2011.\\n\\n- The Winter Olympic Games is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practised on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994.\\n\\n- The 1924 Winter Olympics, officially known as the I Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"Iers Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), were a winter multi-sport event which was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Originally called \\"Semaine Internationale des Sports d'Hiver\\" (\\"International Winter Sports Week\\") and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, the sports competitions were held at the foot of Mont Blanc in Chamonix, and Haute-Savoie, France between January 25 and February 5, 1924. The Games were organized by the French Olympic Committee, and were in retrospect designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the I Olympic Winter Games.\\n\\n- The Engadin or Engadine (, , ; lit.: \\"Valley of the Inn people\\") is a long high Alpine valley region in the eastern Swiss Alps located in the canton of Graubünden in most southeastern Switzerland with about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the Inn from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, one hundred kilometers downstream. The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Donau, as the only Swiss river. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'sport' with the subject 'anders haugen'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- alpine skiing\\n - bobsleigh\\n - climbing\\n - curling\\n - figure skating\\n - ice skating\\n - nordic combined\\n - nordic skiing\\n - running\\n - ski jumping\\n - skiing\\n - speed skating\\n - sport","target":"nordic combined","rationale":"The information and question are about the sport 'nordic combined'.

Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rhön Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia.

The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added.

In the fourth quarter, Jacksonville began to rally as Scobee nailed a 26-yard field goal, FB Montell Owens returned the fumbled kickoff 18 yards for a touchdown, and RB Maurice Jones-Drew got a 1-yard TD pass.  Fortunately, the Bengals' defense prevented the Jaguars from getting the 2-point conversion, allowing Cincinnati to finally get its first win of the season.

But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand.\\nIt was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been.\\nPerhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right?\\nThe living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them.\\n\\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.\\nConflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation.

He is of Italian descent on his maternal side.\\n\\nTexas A&M faced uncertainty at the quarterback position when Ryan Tannehill left for the National Football League after the 2011 season. Manziel performed well during spring ball and fall practices and won the starting job over Jameill Showers and Matt Joeckel before the season began. His first game was supposed to be against Louisiana Tech in Shreveport, Louisiana on Thursday, August 30, 2012, but the game was postponed until October 13 due to Hurricane Isaac hitting the Louisiana coast two days prior to game time. Consequently, Manziel's college football debut was played as a redshirt freshman against the Florida Gators before a home crowd at Kyle Field.  Although Manziel began the season in relative obscurity, his play against Arkansas in which he broke Archie Manning's 43-year-old total offense record gained him some attention. Manziel produced 557 yards of total offense, breaking Manning's record of 540. Two games later, Manziel surpassed his own total offense record against #24 Louisiana Tech by achieving 576 yards of total offense, becoming the first player in SEC history to have two 500+ total offense games in one season. After Texas A&M's blowout of Auburn in the eighth game of the season, in which Manziel accounted for 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns through only the first half plus one series in the second, Manziel began showing up in national Heisman Watch lists.  Manziel was launched into the national scene after he led Texas A&M to a 29-24 victory over #1 Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In that game, Manziel accounted for 345 of A&M's 418 yards of offense, including two passing touchdowns. In the following days, Manziel became the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy in most national watch lists and polls due to his performance during the game combined with other Heisman frontrunners faltering.  On November 24, during the game against the Missouri Tigers before a home crowd, Manziel left the game with an apparent knee injury late in the first quarter. He returned to the field for the next series of downs wearing a knee brace and finished the game with 439 yards of total offense, including 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns. During the game, he broke the single season record for offensive production in the SEC with 4,600 yards, surpassing Cam Newton and Tim Tebow, notable recent Heisman Trophy winners. He also became the first freshman and only the fifth player in NCAA history to pass for 3000 and rush for 1,000 yards in a season, reaching that mark two games earlier than any other player.

His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin.\\n\\n- Chthonic (from Greek  \\"khthonios\\" , \\"in, under, or beneath the earth\\", from  \\"khthn\\" \\"earth\\") literally means \\"subterranean\\". The translation of meaning discusses deities or spirits of the underworld, especially in Greek religion. The Greek word \\"khthon\\" is one of several for \\"earth\\"; it typically refers to the interior of the soil, rather than the living surface of the land (as \\"Gaia\\" or \\"Ge\\" does), or the land as territory (as \\"khora\\" () does).\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, Alcmene or Alcmena (or  [Doric]) was the wife of Amphitryon by whom she bore two children, Iphicles and Laonome. She is, however, better known as the mother of Heracles whose father was the god Zeus.\\n\\n- Amphitryon (\\"gen\\".: ; usually interpreted as \\"harassing either side\\"), in Greek mythology, was a son of Alcaeus, king of Tiryns in Argolis.\\n\\n- In Greek mythology, the Heracleidae or Heraclids were the numerous descendants of Heracles (Hercules), especially applied in a narrower sense to the descendants of Hyllus, the eldest of his four sons by Deianira (Hyllus was also sometimes thought of as Heracles' son by Melite) Other Heracleidae included Macaria, Lamos, Manto, Bianor, Tlepolemus, and Telephus. These Heraclids were a group of Dorian kings who conquered the Peloponnesian kingdoms of Mycenae, Sparta and Argos; according to the literary tradition in Greek mythology, they claimed a right to rule through their ancestor. Since Karl Otfried Müller's \\"Die Dorier\\" (1830, English translation 1839), I. ch. 3, their rise to dominance has been associated with a \\"Dorian invasion\\".\\n\\n- Hercules is the Roman adaptation of the Greek divine hero Heracles, who was the son of Zeus (Roman equivalent Jupiter) and the mortal Alcmene. In classical mythology, Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures.\\n\\n- Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.\\n\\n- Echembrotus ( Greek :  ) was an ancient Arcadian Greek lyricist and poet . According to Pausanias , Echembrotus offered a bronze tripod to Heracles when the latter won at the Amphictyonic Games .\\n\\n- Heracles ( \\"Hrakls\\", from \\"Hra\\", \\"Hera\\"), born Alcaeus (\\"Alkaios\\") or Alcides (\\"Alkeids\\"), was a divine hero in Greek mythology, the son of Zeus and Alcmene, foster son of Amphitryon and great-grandson and half-brother (as they are both sired by the god Zeus) of Perseus. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be Heracleidae and a champion of the Olympian order against chthonic monsters. In Rome and the modern West, he is known as Hercules, with whom the later Roman emperors, in particular Commodus and Maximian, often identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the Central Mediterranean. Details of his cult were adapted to Rome as well.\\n\\n- Hera (, Greek , \\"Hr\\", equivalently , \\"Hr\\", in Ionic and Homer) is the goddess of women and marriage in Greek mythology and religion. She is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. Hera is married to her brother Zeus and is titled as the Queen of Heaven. Some of her characteristics include her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus's other lovers and offspring and against the mortals who cross her.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'echembrotus' exhibits the relationship of 'ethnic group'.

Since marrying the now King of Jordan in 1993, she has become known for her advocacy work related to education, health, community empowerment, youth, cross-cultural dialogue and micro-finance. She is also an avid user of social media and she maintains pages on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter.\\n\\nIn November 2000, in recognition of her commitment to the cause of children and youth, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) invited Queen Rania to join its Global Leadership Initiative. The Queen worked alongside other world leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, in a global movement seeking to improve the welfare of children. In January 2007, Queen Rania was named UNICEF's first Eminent Advocate for Children. In August 2009, Queen Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI).  As a longtime supporter of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), Queen Rania met with children and inspirational women in South Africa, both in the cities of Johannesburg and Soweto, in March 2009. Queen Rania and the women took turns reading a short story out of The Big Read to the children, in an effort to encourage literacy. One of the stories in the book, \\"Maha of the Mountains\\", was contributed by Queen Rania. In Soweto, she was the first to write her name in the back of the Big Read, before passing it on to everyone else to write their name.  During her April 2009 US trip, Queen Rania joined leading education advocates Congresswoman Nita Lowey and Counsellor to the Secretary of the Treasury Gene Sperling to launch \\"The Big Read\\" as part of Global Campaign for Education's global action week calling for quality basic education for all children. She was also hosted by first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, during that same trip.  On 20 August 2009, Queen Rania co-founded and led the launch of the \\"1GOAL: Education for All\\" campaign alongside Gary Lineker, and with the help of top international footballers at Wembley Stadium, London. Queen Rania is co-founder and global co-chair of the 1GOAL campaign to rally World Cup 2010 fans together during the world's biggest single sporting event and call on world leaders to give 75 million children out of school an education. On 6 October 2009, Queen Rania was joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the UK, the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, and other heads of state, for the Global Launch of 1GOAL, which took place across six locations worldwide. Queen Rania spoke of the need to turn this \\"tragedy into triumph\\" and called on political leaders to stand by their aid commitments.  In 2008, Queen Rania participated in YouTube's In My Name campaign.

His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with Jürgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu.

POST : This is a long one, tl;dr will be provided.\\n\\nThis actually happened last year, but it has been gnawing at me for some time and I figured posting here might help me put the issue to rest. For context, this occurred at the very beginning of the summer after I graduated high school in June. I had been dating my girlfriend at the time for about 4 months, the first 3 of which were wonderful. However, things started to take a turn for the worse towards the final days of the school year. My Ex has moderate to severe BPD, and this began to cause problems toward the end of the relationship. She told me about it relatively early on, and I made sure to be as supportive as possible. Since I’ve been told by friends that I’m a good listener and someone to count (at least I’d like to think so) I let her know that she could talk to me about anything if she felt the need. Although she was rather closed off at first, she rather quickly began to “vent” to me on a regular basis. These instances became more and more frequent and progressively got darker as time went on, and I honestly became less sympathetic. She would put down her friends and others close to her for what I would consider mild inconveniences, often exclaiming that “They know what they’re doing, if they don’t support me or ask me how I’m feeling if I look upset than how are they real friends?” I’m very much a person that likes to cut people slack. A few minutes late? No problem. Didn’t talk to me for very long at a party? All good, lots of people you need to attend to. But it seemed to me that she took these kinds of things as an affront, as if there were a setlist of requirements to being in her personal circle. Not only did this attitude seem to alienate her friends, but it also started to alienate me. \\n\\nBy the last two weeks, I was rather drained and honestly waiting for a good time to have a serious conversation about our relationship. Everything culminated the night before we broke up. We were at her best friends graduation party with a shitload of mutual friends. I drove her there and spent the majority of the first few hours with her and some of the other couples. After some time and a few beers, I began to wander around and talk to people who went to our school who I had never gotten around to meeting before. Honestly, I was having a blast, and assumed she was with her friends feeling the same. When I returned about 30 min later she was gone, so I went to look for her and found her alone in a quiet portion of the house. She was rather distraught and didn’t tell me why, despite my asking. I quickly became fed up and told her I was going back to the party and she could join me if she wanted to which she declined. After drinking much more as the night went on, I caught back up with her when it was time for bed. In the middle of the night I drunkenly woke up to her hysterically crying next to me. When I asked what was wrong she said she knew I didn’t love her and that I was considering how she felt at all. I was kind of taken aback at first, but so drunk that I just told her we should talk about it in the morning. The next day I told her rather frankly that I thought she was an unessecarily negative person and that, as hard a burden as it is, mental illness is no excuse to treat people the way she had been.\\nI told her that she wasn’t being rational and she should seriously consider seeing a therapist about these emotions and that it could be seriously beneficial to he mental health. After some heated arguing I told her that it would be best to break up under the current circumstances and so we did. Last I heard she continues to maintain that I’m an emotionless rock who couldn’t understand her point of view, and sometimes I find myself believing her. Maybe I could have handled it better?  Let me have it.\\n\\n\\nTl;dr Ex has serious emotional problems and negative habits that made me break up with her, she has said that I just couldn’t see her side and wasn’t supportive enough and too “cold and objective”","target":"no","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning if they handled a breakup appropriately.\\\\nIn the post, the author uses the past tense to describe the events, but they do not explicitly state when the events occurred. However, they mention that it was at her best friend's graduation party and that it was at \\"\\"the very beginning of summer after I graduated high school in June\\"\\", which suggests that this event occurred in June of last year.\\\\nBased on this analysis, it seems like this post is not hypothetical as a break up has already happened.

The band rose to international fame with their first single, \\"Kryptonite\\", which charted in the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\\nContext: By 2005, the band had sold 12 million albums. The band's third studio album, 2005's Seventeen Days, has been certified platinum.

During the Seventeen Days tour, the band appeared alongside southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as headlining many shows of their own.  Later in 2005, the band released a live DVD entitled Away from the Sun: Live from Houston, Texas. The DVD was produced and directed by Academy Award nominated Alex Gibney and Doug Biro. It features songs from both The Better Life and Away from the Sun, and even some early sketches of \\"It's Not Me\\" and \\"Father's Son\\", which were both eventually released on Seventeen Days.  Greg Upchurch, formerly of Puddle of Mudd, replaced Daniel Adair in 2005, when Adair left to become drummer and contributing member of Nickelback.  3 Doors Down released their self-titled fourth album on May 20, 2008.

I probably had about 6 hours worth of experience overall. It was fine when me and the manager were both working, one of us could take orders and another could prep foods and anything I wasn't sure how to do I could ask him, or he would do it for me.\\n\\nSo it was going fine until he decided to take his half an hour break and said if I needed anything he'd be in the back, after which I very quickly got behind on taking and making orders when a large group came in, until I had a large queue. To make things worse, because I didn't have much experience with how online orders worked and because I had been so busy trying to manage the customers, 3 delivery drivers turned up at once all asking for their orders, which I hadn't made yet, and because I hadn't got used to the systems I didn't know what order to give them. the situation just got worse until I had to go to the back of store and tell the manager I felt I was out of my depth needed help, to which he got very angry and continuously told me he didn't get paid for his breaks so there is no way he's coming out to help me and that its not that hard, I went back to the front and just tried to deal with customers and leave the delivery drivers waiting to be dealt with later, but they were getting very agitated so i panicked and went to ask him again and again until he came off his break to help me make some orders. After we dealt with all the customers he was clearly pretty furious for having to come off his break and went away to finish it. and after that he would constantly snap at me for doing things wrong and show me how to do things as if they were the most simple things in the world, and i was an idiot for not knowing right away (tbf they were pretty simple, but it was my first time doing them and i was just asking bc i didn't know)\\n\\nAnyway, Ive just been wondering whether I should have basically been a better worker, been more on top of things and tried to deal with them myself, rather than making him come off his break and work when he's not being paid, (it was probably ten mins work tops).

Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches.

The couple's beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media reports a rumour that the name Azaria means \\"sacrifice in the wilderness\\" (when in fact it means \\"blessed of God\\"), the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite.

In the most general case, polarization is elliptical, meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time. Two special cases are linear polarization (the ellipse collapses into a line) as we have discussed above, and circular polarization (in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal). In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation. Circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as right-handed or left-handed using the \\"thumb in the direction of the propagation\\" rule.

A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert's Land. During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg.

His father had emigrated from Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire and was a prominent lawyer, rancher, and (later) a Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother had emigrated from Gillingham, Kent and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the 600-acre (240 ha) Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch about fifty miles (eighty kilometers) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri River.\\n\\nFor me the really satisfying things I do are offered me, free, for nothing. Ever go out in the fall and do a little hunting? See the frost on the grass and the leaves turning? Spend a day in the hills alone, or with good companions? Watch a sunset and a moonrise? Notice a bird in the wind? A stream in the woods, a storm at sea, cross the country by train, and catch a glimpse of something beautiful in the desert, or the farmlands? Free to everybody ...  Cooper's twenty-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in October 1940. The previous year, Hemingway drew upon Cooper's image when he created the character of Robert Jordan for the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. The two shared a passion for the outdoors, and for years they hunted duck and pheasant, and skied together in Sun Valley. Both men admired the work of Rudyard Kipling--Cooper kept a copy of the poem \\"If--\\" in his dressing room--and retained as adults Kipling's sense of boyish adventure. As well as admiring Cooper's hunting skills and knowledge of the outdoors, Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona, once telling a friend, \\"If you made up a character like Coop, nobody would believe it. He's just too good to be true.\\" They saw each other often, and their friendship remained strong through the years.  Cooper's social life generally centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor. As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving. He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg.  Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, and loved the solitude of outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional \\"yup\\" and \\"shucks\\". He once said, \\"If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet.\\" According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status--never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, \\"Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him.\\"\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"did he own a lot of cars?","rationale":"The article mentions that Cooper had a lifelong passion for automobiles and owned several of them.

Both of his parents were World War II veterans. Ventura has an older brother who served in the Vietnam War. Ventura has described himself as Slovak, since his father's parents were from what is now Slovakia; his mother was of German descent.\\n\\nVentura ran for Governor of Minnesota in 1998 as the nominee for the Reform Party of Minnesota (he later joined the Independence Party of Minnesota when the Reform Party broke from its association with the Reform Party of the United States of America). His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive grassroots events organized in part by his campaign manager Doug Friedline and original television spots, designed by quirky adman Bill Hillsman, using the phrase \\"Don't vote for politics as usual.\\" He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $300,000) and was a pioneer in his using the Internet as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.  He won the election in November 1998, narrowly (and unexpectedly) defeating the major-party candidates, St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman (Republican) and Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. \\"Skip\\" Humphrey III (Democratic-Farmer-Labor). During his victory speech, Ventura famously declared, \\"We shocked the world!\\" After his election, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan \\"My governor can beat up your governor\\" appeared in Minnesota. The nickname \\"Jesse 'The Mind'\\" (from a last-minute Hillsman ad featuring Ventura posing as Rodin's Thinker) began to resurface sarcastically in reference to his frequently controversial remarks. Ventura's old stage name \\"Jesse 'The Body'\\" (sometimes adapted to \\"Jesse 'The Governing Body'\\") also continued to appear with some regularity.  After a trade mission to China in 2002, Ventura announced that he would not run for a second term, stating that he no longer felt dedicated enough to his job to run again as well as what he viewed were constant attacks on his family by the media. Ventura accused the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and belief while neglecting coverage of important policy issues. He later told a reporter for The Boston Globe that he would have run for a second term if he had been single, citing the media's effect on his family life.  Governor Ventura sparked media criticism when, nearing the end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, Mae Schunk, an opportunity to serve as governor. He further stated that he wanted her to be the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors.

In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics.","target":"British Isles","rationale":"The given context is about the kingdoms, dynasties and wars that were fought in Britain, Ireland and Scotland.

We first discussed a date and threw ideas around about a month ago. At that time the groom was working retail as a manager and said he has a really hard time taking weekends off. As such, we decided to plan the party for a Wednesday to accommodate his needs. Two party members were glad for this decision because they also work retail/service and also have an easier time taking off during the week compared to the weekend. Other party members and friends to be invited work regular Mon-Fri, 9-5 jobs (myself included). Some of them are even coming in from out of state. But we all agreed we could take vacation time to make it work to make sure the groom’s needs were met.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAbout a week and a half ago he informs our friend group (in general) that he’s applying for an office job. I halted planning because I knew if he got it he would probably prefer a Saturday over a Wednesday (I also knew he'd probably get it since I used to work there and a mutual friend still does and recommended him). Yesterday he found out he got the job. He’s super excited and relieved to escape retail hell, and I’m super happy for him, too! But this means he now does the M-F, 9-5 grind and that the Wednesday is no longer convenient for him at all. I asked him if he’d like us to move it to a Saturday and he said yes please.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo I contacted the group to say, “Hey, since the groom’s job situation has changed I think it’s best to move the party date to that Saturday instead.” As a note, this party was planned for 3/20 and I proposed we move it to 3/23 with approval from the groom, AKA, it’s still a month away. No reservations have been made and no money has been put down. Everything is local, relatively inexpensive, and we are not staying at a hotel or renting limos (per the groom’s tastes we’re doing stuff like an old school arcade and stuff).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe two party members working retail/service are balking. One of them says she already requested off and there’s no way she can get that Saturday off despite it being a month away, and that we already agreed to a Wednesday. I reiterated that the change is to accommodate the groom and asked if they could at least try to request off. They’re acting like I’m an asshole because I want to change the date based on the groom’s new circumstances. I even offered to try to move the date to a later weekend but they aren’t budging. They think we should go forward with the Wednesday. I don’t want my friends’ party to only have half his wedding party but I also don’t see how it’s fair to make the groom use 2 out of his 5 vacation days for his own bachelor party when he’ll need those days for more important things. Especially when he has weekends off at no cost of PTO.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, am I the asshole here?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author states that, in the future, they plan to attend a bachelor party on Saturday. They are trying to change the date of the bachelor party because they believe it is unfair for the groom to use 2 out of his 5 vacation days for his own bachelor party when he'll need those days for more important things. However, two other members of the wedding party are balking at changing the date and say it's unfair that they have to take vacation time off work.\\n\\nIn this scenario, it seems like neither side is being very fair or considerate towards each other. The wedding party has already made plans and arrangements so that they can attend on Wednesday (a weekday), which was apparently preferred by both sides earlier on in planning. Therefore, insisting on moving the day from Wednesday to Saturday (a weekend) would cause undue inconvenience and hardship for some members of the wedding party. The author should try a bit harder to accommodate their friends' schedules and needs by not insisting so strongly upon moving everything back several days just because 3/20 no longer works well with one person's schedule. The answer is 'yes', as both parties are being somewhat stubborn here and should try harder to work together towards an agreeable compromise such as finding a middle ground between 3/20 vs 3/23 vs later weekends in March where everyone can be accommodated reasonably well without causing too much hardship or inconvenience for anyone involved.\\""},{"source":"Question: \\"When did Kerry's political career actually begin?\\"\\n\\nContext: \\"In 1970, Kerry had considered running for Congress in the Democratic primary against hawkish Democrat Philip J.

Soon after, Professor Wallace tells about the sudden appearance nearby of a miracle of miracle: The Zone.The next scene shows a dingy room where three figures, a man, a woman, and a child, are asleep together in a wrought iron bed. Next to the bed is a pair of crutches. The man slowly gets up, dresses, goes to the kitchen sink and washes himself. The woman, his wife (Alisa Frejndlikh), joins him and scolds him for returning to his old ways, which will surely land him back in jail. The man argues briefly for her to let him go, that he must go, and he finally pushes her aside and leaves the room. As he leaves, his wife curses the day she ever met him and reproaches him for having begotten such a child. She falls to the ground, weeping.The man, Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky), goes to the waterfront to meet with a couple, a well-dressed woman and a man, Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn). He rudely dismisses the woman and, together with Writer, walks back to the bar shown in the opening of the film, where a third man, Professor (Nikolai Grinko), is waiting for them. No sooner as these two men meet that they start bickering with each other. Stalker will guide these two men through The Zone. Writer explains that the reason for his trip is to recover his lost inspiration while Professors motivation is purely scientific curiosity.Stalker and the two men leave the bar for their dangerous mission into The Zone.

A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.\\n\\n- Coastal artillery is the branch of the armed forces concerned with operating anti-ship artillery or fixed gun batteries in coastal fortifications.\\n\\n- The Swedish Armed Forces is the government agency that forms the military forces of Sweden, and which is tasked with defence of the country, as well as promoting Sweden's wider interests, supporting international peacekeeping efforts, and providing humanitarian aid.\\n\\n- The Amphibious Corps is the coastal defence arm of the Swedish Navy. Until 2000 it was known as Coastal Artillery, but the name was changed to reflect its different role in a post-Cold War world, where its amphibious special operations arm, the Coastal Rangers, has grown in significance while its coastal batteries have been decommissioned. \\n\\n- Warsaw (; see also other names) is the capital and largest city of Poland. It stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland, roughly from the Baltic Sea and from the Carpathian Mountains. Its population is estimated at 1.750 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 3.105 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union. The city limits cover , while the metropolitan area covers .\\n\\n- World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- The Truman Doctrine was an American foreign policy created to counter Soviet geopolitical spread during the Cold War. It was first announced to Congress by President Harry S. Truman on March 12, 1947 and further developed on July 12, 1948 when he pledged to contain Soviet threats to Greece and Turkey. American military force was usually not involved, but Congress appropriated free gifts of financial aid to support the economies and the military of Greece and Turkey. More generally, the Truman doctrine implied American support for other nations threatened by Soviet communism. The Truman Doctrine became the foundation of American foreign policy, and led, in 1949, to the formation of NATO, a military alliance that is still in effect. Historians often use Truman's speech to date the start of the Cold War.\\nTruman told Congress that \\"it must be the policy of the United States to support free people who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\\" Truman reasoned that because the totalitarian regimes coerced free peoples, they represented a threat to international peace and the national security of the United States. Truman made the plea amid the crisis of the Greek Civil War (194649). He argued that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid that they urgently needed, they would inevitably fall to communism with grave consequences throughout the region. Because Turkey and Greece were historic rivals, it was necessary to help both equally even though the threat to Greece was more immediate. Historian Eric Foner argues the Truman Doctrine \\"set a precedent for American assistance to anticommunist regimes throughout the world, no matter how undemocratic, and for the creation of a set of global military alliances directed against the Soviet Union.\\"\\n\\n- The London and Paris Conferences were two related conferences in London and Paris in SeptemberOctober 1954 to determine the status of West Germany. The talks concluded with the signing of the Paris Agreements (Paris Pacts, or Paris Accords), which granted West Germany full sovereignty, ended the occupation, and allowed its admittance to NATO. Furthermore, both West Germany and Italy joined the Brussels Treaty on 23 October 1954. The Agreements went into force on 5 May 1955. The participating powers included France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, and remaining NATO members.\\n\\n- The term satellite state designates a country that is formally independent in the world, but under heavy political, economic and military influence or control from another country. The term was coined by analogy to planetary objects orbiting a larger object, such as smaller moons revolving around larger planets, and is used mainly to refer to Central and Eastern European countries of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War or to Mongolia between 1924 and 1990, for example. As used for Central and Eastern European countries it implies that the countries in question were \\"satellites\\" under the hegemony of the Soviet Union. In some contexts it also refers to other countries in the Soviet sphere of influence during the Cold Warsuch as North Korea (especially in the years surrounding the Korean War of 19501953) and Cuba (particularly after it joined the Comecon in 1972). In Western usage, the term has seldom been applied to states other than those in the Soviet orbit. In Soviet usage, the term applied to the states in the orbit of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\\n\\n- The Swedish Royal Navy is the naval branch of the Swedish Armed Forces. It is composed of surface and submarine naval units  the Fleet (Kungliga Flottan)  as well as marine units, the Amphibious Corps (Amfibiekåren).\\n\\n- The Western Bloc or Capitalist Bloc during the Cold War refers to the countries allied with the NATO against the Soviet Union and its allies. The latter were referred to as the \\"Eastern Bloc\\", a more common term in English than \\"Western Bloc\\". The governments and press of the Western Bloc were more inclined to refer to themselves as the \\"Free World\\" or the \\"Western world\\". \\"Western Europe\\" is a controversial term used to refer to democratic countries in Europe during the Cold War, but the concept is sometimes still used for quick reference by the media.\\n\\n- West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic.\\n\\n- The Warsaw Pact, formally the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance and sometimes, informally, WarPac. was a collective defense treaty among the Soviet Union and seven other Soviet satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe in existence during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CoMEcon), the regional economic organization for the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO in 1955 per the London and Paris Conferences of 1954, but it is also considered to have been motivated by Soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in Central and Eastern Europe.\\n\\n- Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are \\"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\\". A related United Nations paper adds that \\"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\\".\\n\\n- Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.\\n\\n- The Swedish coastal artillery ( Swedish : Kustartilleriet , KA ) has its origin in the Archipelago Artillery that was raised in 1866 . The Coastal Artillery was formed from the Archipelago Artillery , the Marine Regiment and parts of the Artillery in 1902 . Kustartilleriet , abbreviated KA , was an independent branch within the Swedish Navy until July 1 , 2000 , when the Swedish Coastal Artillery was disbanded and reorganised as the Amfibiekåren ( Swedish Amphibious Corps ) . The changed name and new structure were to reflect the new tasks that the old Coastal Artillery had moved to after the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Warsaw Pact .\\n\\n- The armed forces of a country are its government-sponsored defense, fighting forces, and organizations. They exist to further the foreign and domestic policies of their governing body and to defend that body and the nation it represents from external and internal aggressors. In broad usage, the terms \\"armed forces\\" and \\"military\\" are often treated synonymously, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces. Armed force is the use of armed forces to achieve political objectives.\\nThe study of the use of armed forces is called military science. Broadly speaking, this involves considering offense and defense at three \\"levels\\": strategy, operational art, and tactics. All three levels study the application of the use of force in order to achieve a desired objective.\\n\\n- The Eastern Bloc was the group of communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, generally the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact. The terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union, although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe.\\n\\n- The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.\\n\\n- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO  '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.\\n\\n- Central and Eastern Europe, abbreviated CEE, is a generic term for the group of countries in Central Europe, Southeast Europe, Northern Europe, and Eastern Europe, usually meaning former communist states in Europe. It is in use after the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 198990. In scholarly literature the abbreviations CEE or CEEC are often used for this concept.\\n\\n- The 20th century was a century that began on  January 1, 1901 and ended on December 31, 2000. It was the tenth and final century of the 2nd millennium. It is distinct from the century known as the 1900s (sometimes written as 19XX), which began on January 1, 1900 and ended on December 31, 1999.\\n\\n- The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'swedish coastal artillery' exhibits the relationship of 'part of'.

Passage:The river starts at Ralph Bice Lake (formerly Butt Lake) in northern Algonquin Provincial Park in the geographic township of Butt in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. It flows south to Daisy Lake then east to Big Trout Lake. The river heads north out the lake over Big Trout Lake Dam, takes in the left tributary Tim River, flows over the Portal Rapids, Cedar Rapids, Snowshoe Rapids, Catfish Rapids, and Stacks Rapids to reach Cedar Lake, the location of the community of Brent, where it takes in the left tributary Nipissing River. The river exits the lake over a dam, heads through the Devil's Chute, reaches Radiant Lake, where it takes in the left tributary North River and right tributary Little Madawaska River, and passes through the Squirrel Rapids, Big Sawyer Rapids, Battery Rapids Cascade Rapids and White Horse Rapids, and takes in the right tributary Crow River. The river then continues through a series of rapids including the Devil's Cellar Rapids, passes the Algonquin Radio Observatory, and reaches Lake Travers. The Petawawa River enters a canyon and passes through numerous rapids including the Big Thompson Rapids, Little Thompson Rapids, Grillade Rapids, Crooked Chute, Rollway Rapids, The Natch, Schooner Rapids, Five Mile Rapids to arrive at Whitson Lake adjacent to the Petawawa Hills. It leaves Algonquin Provincial Park and enters the municipality of Laurentian Hills in Renfrew County, continues southeast past CFB Petawawa, passes through the Crooked Rapids, Race Horse Rapids, White Horse Rapids and Halfmile Rapids, and reaches Lac du Bois Dur, where it takes in the right tributary Barron River.

Kant argues that the human mind creates the structure of human experience, that reason is the source of morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that the world as it is \\"in-itself\\" is independent of humanity's concepts of it. Kant took himself to have effected a \\"Copernican revolution\\" in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolves around the earth.\\n\\nImmanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 in Konigsberg, Prussia (since 1946 the city of Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). His mother, Anna Regina Reuter (1697-1737), was also born in Konigsberg to a father from Nuremberg. (Her name is sometimes erroneously given as Anna Regina Porter.) His father, Johann Georg Kant (1682-1746), was a German harness maker from Memel, at the time Prussia's most northeastern city (now Klaipeda, Lithuania). Immanuel Kant believed that his paternal grandfather Hans Kant was of Scottish origin. While scholars of Kant's life long accepted the claim, there is no evidence that Kant's paternal line was Scottish; it is more likely that the Kants got their name from the village of Kantwaggen (today part of Priekule) and were of Curonian origin. Kant was the fourth of nine children (four of them reached adulthood). Baptized 'Emanuel', he changed his name to 'Immanuel' after learning Hebrew.  Young Kant was a solid, albeit unspectacular, student. Kant was born into a Prussian German family of Lutheran Protestant faith in East Prussia. He was brought up in a Pietist household that stressed religious devotion, humility, and a literal interpretation of the Bible. His education was strict, punitive and disciplinary, and focused on Latin and religious instruction over mathematics and science. Kant maintained a belief in Christianity, in his work Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals he reveals a belief in human immortality as the necessary condition of our continued approach to the highest good possible. However, as Kant was skeptical about some of the arguments used prior to him in defence of Theism and maintained that human understanding is limited and can never attain knowledge about God or the soul, various commentators have labelled him a philosophical agnostic.  Common myths about Kant's personal mannerisms are listed, explained, and refuted in Goldthwait's introduction to his translation of Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime. It is often held that Kant lived a very strict and disciplined life, leading to an oft-repeated story that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. He never married, but seemed to have a rewarding social life -- he was a popular teacher and a modestly successful author even before starting on his major philosophical works. He had a circle of friends whom he frequently met, among them Joseph Green, an English merchant in Konigsberg.  A common myth is that Kant never traveled more than 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Konigsberg his whole life. In fact, between 1750 and 1754 he worked as a tutor (Hauslehrer) in Judtschen (now Veselovka, Russia, approximately 20 km) and in Gross-Arnsdorf (now Jarnoltowo near Morag (German: Mohrungen), Poland, approximately 145 km).\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Immanuel Kant","rationale":"From the given context, it can be inferred that this text is about Immanuel Kant."},{"source":"Generate a question that has the following answer: \\nJohnny Terrori \\nfor the following movie plot: \\nJoseph Amadeus von Dracula, known as Pepito to his friends, is a trumpet player in 1930s Havana who spends his time away from the bandstand dabbling in quasi-terrorist plots to overthrow the Cuban government of dictator, Gerardo Machado.

In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.\\n\\n- Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.\\n\\nAnswer this question please: In which organism cellular respiration would not occur, sample A or sample B?","target":"sample B","rationale":"The background information provides the definition of cellular respiration, which uses oxygen and glucose to produce ATP. The context for this question is that there are four samples taken from organisms (A-D) in a biology lab. Sample A has been induced with higher respiration rate while sample B had no respiration at all during induction tests. Sample C was classified as heterotrophic while sample D was autotrophic by Bob the biologist who took the samples.\\nBased on these clues, we can infer that celluar respiration would not occur in sample B because it did not have any reaction to an increase or decrease in its breathing rate when tested earlier by Bob the biologist; if it doesn't breathe then it cannot partake in cellular resoiratoin since breathing requires oxygen intake into cells"},{"source":"As of 2016, six teams do not have cheerleading squads: Buffalo Bills, Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Green Bay Packers, New York Giants, and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T.

But if it's reversed (case B) then no doubt reactants would be increased instead since they are now favored by being stressed more than before. So that makes clear answer \\"reactant concentration would increase\\" in case B"},{"source":"A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms.

While waiting, Sonny orders a drink and flirts with the bartender. Outside, two white Escalades pull up to the club and out jumps a 15-person entourage of thuggish men and scantily clad women, led by Neptune (Isaach De Bankole). The entourage skips the line, enters the club, and once inside Neptune approaches undercover Detective Stan Switek (Dominick Lombardozzi). It seems Neptune is a pimp, and he offers his ladies' services to Switek. Switek notices one of the prostitutes looks shaken and upset, but Neptune explains that she is feeling a little sick. Switek takes two of the prostitutes to an elevator, while Neptune and the thugs take the other ladies, including the upset prostitute, in the other direction. Tubbs sees the upset prostitute being handled roughly, and begins to follow her with Sonny right behind. One of the thugs get in Tubbs way, but Tubbs quickly dispatches him. Some more thugs begin attacking Tubbs and Sonny, but the detectives easily beat them up. However, Neptune and the upset prostitute make it to an exit. Meanwhile, Zito and Calabrese are using a cellphone to watch a live video of Switek undressing with the prostitutes.Sonny's pursuit is then interrupted by a phone call. Sonny walks out to a balcony to hear the call better. It turns out to be Alonzo Stevens (John Hawkes), a former informant who worked with Sonny and Tubbs. Hawkes is frantic and driving very fast.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

She said I was her first tinder date after trying to get back into dating. We broke up after she revealed she was dating someone else behind my back and I got upset over feeling used. \\n\\nDetails :\\n\\nRecently, I dated someone who admitted that i was their first tinder date after a long period, eventually admitting she had a broken engagement awhile back that resulted in a psychological trauma.\\n\\nNow this has happened to me more than once. I guess I have a friendly and approachable look, fit, totally put together life, and very relaxed personality. I'm not an instagram model but I feel like I'm pretty competitive. I can go from matched on tinder to drinks at bar pretty smoothly thanks to confidence in dating and what i hope is a good personality. Usually this \\"you're my first date on tinder\\" scenario ends up with a quick drink and the realization that neither of us have any chemistry and we split. It has always stuck in my mind though, am I just a placeholder? A warmup act for women to date and bide their time while searching for a top tier tinder date?\\n\\nSo anyway, from the get-go I stated that I was interested in a serious relationship and pressed several times over the course of several dates that I wanted to learn more about what she wanted. I wanted to know if we were compatible or if I was wasting time. I never got a real reply, just vague answers or \\"i'll tell you later\\". Another red-flag was related to the fact that we both work in the same field, and she said on a date as a joke \\"i was kind of hoping to use you for your network to get a job\\", as she is unemployed in the field right now. That worried me but I brushed it off. Anyway, several dates later I got the breakup call, with the news that she's been dating someone else who she was able to open up emotionally with.\\n\\nI've been through plenty of breakups, and am usually pretty cool about it but this time I had a total emotional breakdown. Just a bunch of sappy texts really. I had been holding a lot of pent up emotion waiting for her to open up emotionally to me but she had been opening up to someone else.\\n\\nI feel like I was an easy person to date as a placeholder while she searched for another boyfriend. Specifically I feel like I did a lot of work building trust and confidence in her to start dating again, which she used to find someone else. She then dumped all that emotion from our relationship on the next dude line.\\n\\nProblem :\\n\\nI feel like I got used.\\n\\nShe feels I am deluded.\\n\\nAITA?","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author dated someone who admitted that they were the author's first tinder date after a long period. The author revealed that they had been through a similar situation several times before. They explained that they feel like they are being used as a \\"\\"warmup act\\"\\" for women to date and bide their time while searching for a top tier tinder date.\\\\nThe author describes how the relationship with this particular person began and how it progressed over time. The person expressed interest in starting serious relationships again, but was vague when asked about what she wanted and was not emotionally open with the author, which concerned him. When ending the relationship, she revealed that she had been dating someone else during their relationship who she felt more comfortable opening up to emotionally than her boyfriend at the time (the author). The news caused him to have an emotional breakdown because he felt like he had been used as an intermediary boyfriend to help her get back on track with dating again after her past engagement trauma, only to be dumped so quickly upon finding someone else with whom she felt more comfortable being emotionally open.\\\\nWhile it is not clear whether or not there was any malicious intent on this individual's part (it could just be bad communication), having multiple dates before dating is common practice in our society today and does not necessarily mean that one is using another as some sort of stepping stone in their journey towards finding love/partnership/etc., especially if those dates are occurring simultaneously rather than one after another without any overlap -- which appears to be what happened here given how early into the relationship this woman met someone new and started seeing them behind her boyfriend's back without telling him about it until afterwards when ending things between them due to feeling more comfortable opening up sexually/emotionally with this other guy than with him, suggesting an overlap of some kind (even if only by text or phone) rather than using one person exclusively as a warm-up until meeting another person at some later point in time before proceeding from there onwards -- so there doesn't seem to be much evidence here of deliberately using people for such purposes beyond simply going on dates where chemistry isn't present based on appearance alone; i would say it's fairly normal behavior regardless of gender or sexual orientation etc.. however regardless of whether or not such malicious intent exists within this particular individual, i can definitely understand why these events would make you feel neglected/used/exploited etc., given your past experiences related thereto; therefore you have every right (in my view) under these circumstances and such feelings you may have experienced therein associated therewith thereof henceforth forthwith etc... lol :D\\n\\n[Answer]\\nRIGHT"},{"source":"In this task, you need to provide the correct option for a given problem from the provided options.\\n\\nProblem: bag a contains red , white and blue marbles such that the red to white marble ratio is 1 : 3 and the white to blue marble ratio is 2 : 3 . bag b contains red and white marbles in the ratio of 1 : 4 . together , the two bags contain 22 white marbles . how many red marbles could be in bag a ? \\nOptions: a ) 1 , b ) 3 , c ) 4 , d ) 2 , e ) 8","target":"d","rationale":"Since there are 22 white marbles in both bags combined and the ratio of red to white in bag b is 1:4, we know that bag b must contain 4 white marbles.

Overseeing unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants and alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing led to Libya's label of \\"international pariah\\". A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions. Rejecting his earlier ideological commitments, from 1999 Gaddafi encouraged economic privatization and sought rapprochement with Western nations, also embracing Pan-Africanism and helping to establish the African Union. Amid the Arab Spring, in 2011 an anti-Gaddafist uprising led by the National Transitional Council (NTC) broke out, resulting in the Libyan Civil War.

Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes.\\nThe teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018.\\nThe Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.\\nQuestion: What was the name of one of the students?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. not enough information\\n\\nB.

Their distinctive funk style drew on psychedelic culture, outlandish fashion, science-fiction, and surreal humor; it would have an influential effect on subsequent funk, post-punk, hip-hop, and post-disco artists of the 1980s and 1990s, while their collective mythology would help pioneer Afrofuturism. The collective's origins date back to the doo-wop group the Parliaments, formed by Clinton in the late 1950s in Plainfield, New Jersey. Under the influence of late-1960s artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and Frank Zappa, Clinton later relocated to Detroit and began the sister groups Parliament and Funkadelic, with the former playing an eclectic and more commercial form of funk, and the latter incorporating more influence from psychedelic rock.\\n\\nIn the early 1980s George Clinton continued to record while battling with financial problems and well-publicized drug problems. The remaining members of Parliament-Funkadelic recorded the 1982 hit album Computer Games, which was released as a George Clinton solo album. Included on this release was the much-sampled #1 hit single \\"Atomic Dog\\". The following year, Clinton formed the P-Funk All Stars, who went on to record Urban Dancefloor Guerillas in 1983. The P-Funk All Stars included many of the same members as the late-1970s version of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, and was so named because of various legal issues concerning use of the names Parliament and Funkadelic after 1980. The name P-Funk All Stars is still in use to the current day, and group has included a mix of former Parliament-Funkadelic members as well as guests and new musicians.  As the 1980s continued, P-Funk did not meet with great commercial success as the band continued to produce albums under the name of George Clinton as solo artist. P-Funk retired from touring from 1984 until 1989, except for extremely sporadic performances and TV appearances. It was at this time that Hip hop music began to extensively sample P-Funk music, so remnants of the music were still heard regularly, now among fans of Hip hop. By 1993, most of the Parliament and Funkadelic back catalog had been reissued. The same year saw the return of a reconstituted P-Funk All Stars, with the re-release of Urban Dancefloor Guerrillas under the title Hydraulic Funk, and a new hip hop influenced album Dope Dogs. In 1994, the group toured with the Lollapalooza festival and appeared in the film PCU.  The 1996 album T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M. (The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership), released under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras, such as Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and Junie Morrison. It would be ten years before another album would be released. In the intervening time, successive tours would slowly restore some of the broken ties between the original band members, together with an accumulation of new talent. On July 23, 1999, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, including noteworthy former members Bootsy and Catfish Collins and Bernie Worrell, performed on stage at Woodstock '99. The collective continued to tour sporadically in to the 2000s, with participation from some of the children and grandchildren of the original members.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: did this album make any top charts?","target":"served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras,","rationale":"The answer is: served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras, ....\\n\\nThis quote indicates that P-Funk made its comeback through this album."},{"source":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.\\nQuestions: For the soldier he needed actual hatred, but for his squad member all it took was orders to what?\\nOptions:\\n- judge\\n- conquer opponent\\n- advance into battle\\n- fight enemy\\n- dancing","target":"fight enemy","rationale":"The question is asking what it takes for someone to fight in a battle.

Eighty joules of red light were required to produce 100% cell kill at an HpD concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, a level of HpD that has been quantitated in biopsies from patients receiving HpD photoradiation therapy. No difference in cellular killing efficiency was observed for power densities of red light varying from 10 to 100 mW/cm2.

The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities.

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes 'the principle of equality of its citizens' and is meant to be founded on 'representative democracy'. In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and 'qualified majorities' or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this 'democratic deficit' under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are 'degressively proportional' according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste 'Les Verts' v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power ('kratia') is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people ('demos'): in the EU it is not yet true that 'the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.'

A former mill town, Bolton has been a production centre for textiles since Flemish weavers settled in the area in the 14th century, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition. The urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Bolton was a 19th-century boomtown, and at its zenith in 1929 its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War, and by the 1980s cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton.\\n\\n- Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.\\n\\n- Wigan is a town in Greater Manchester, England. It stands on the River Douglas, south-west of Bolton, north of Warrington and west-northwest of Manchester. Wigan is the largest settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan and is its administrative centre. The town of Wigan had a total population of 97,000 in 2011, whilst the wider borough has a population of 318,100.\\n\\n- Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the appellation of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool.\\n\\n- Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 . It lies within the United Kingdom's second-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.55 million. Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council.\\n\\n- A fantail is a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails , at the rear of the windmill , and which turns the cap automatically to bring it into the wind . The fantail was patented in 1745 by Edmund Lee , a blacksmith working at Brockmill Forge near Wigan , England , and perfected on mills around Leeds and Hull towards the end of the 18th century . Fantails are found on all types of traditional windmills . They are more common in England , Denmark and Germany than in other parts of Europe , and are little - known on windmills elsewhere except where English millwrighting traditions were in evidence . The rotating fantail turns the cap of the windmill via a system of gearing to a toothed rack around the top of the mill tower , or to wheels running on the ground in the case of a post mill. It does so until the fantail sails are oriented parallel to the wind , as in this case the wind can no longer move them . When the fantail is oriented parallel to the wind , the main sails are in the optimal perpendicular orientation and produce maximum power .\\n\\n- Rotational energy or angular kinetic energy is kinetic energy due to the rotation of an object and is part of its total kinetic energy. Looking at rotational energy separately around an object's axis of rotation, the following dependence on the object's moment of inertia is observed:\\n\\n- A windpump is a type of windmill which is used for pumping water.\\nWindpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. The use of wind pumps became widespread across the Muslim world and later spread to China and India. Windmills were later used extensively in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands and the East Anglia area of Great Britain, from the late Middle Ages onwards, to drain land for agricultural or building purposes.\\n\\n- Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 2.8 million. It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Manchester and Salford. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972; and designated a City Region on 1 April 2011.\\n\\n- A windmill is a mill that converts the energy of wind into rotational energy by means of vanes called sails or blades. Centuries ago, windmills usually were used to mill grain, pump water, or both. Thus they often were gristmills, windpumps, or both. The majority of modern windmills take the form of wind turbines used to generate electricity, or windpumps used to pump water, either for land drainage or to extract groundwater.\\n\\n- The Metropolitan Borough of Wigan is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, in North West England. It is named after its largest component town and former county borough, Wigan and includes the towns and villages of Leigh, part of Ashton-in-Makerfield, Ince-in-Makerfield, Hindley, Orrell, Standish, Atherton, Tyldesley, Golborne, Lowton, Billinge, Astley, Haigh and Aspull. The borough was formed in 1974 and is an amalgamation of several former local government districts and parishes. The borough has three civil parishes and lies directly to the west of the City of Salford and southwest of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton. The local authority is Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council.\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.\\n\\n- Elmet was an independent Brittonic kingdom covering a region of what later became the West Riding of Yorkshire in the Early Middle Ages, between about the 5th century and early 7th century. Although its precise borders are unclear, it appears to have been bounded by the River Sheaf in the south and the River Wharfe in the east. It adjoined Deira to the north and Mercia to the south, and its western boundary appears to have been near Craven, which was possibly a minor British kingdom. As such it was well to the east of other territories of the Britons in Wales and the West Country (\\"i.e.\\" Cornwall and Dumnonia), and to the south of those in the \\"Hen Ogledd\\" (\\"Old North\\"). As one of the southeasternmost Brittonic regions for which there is reasonably substantial evidence, it is notable for having survived relatively late in the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.\\n\\n- Loidis, from which Leeds derives its name, was anciently a forested area of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet. The settlement certainly existed at the time of the Norman conquest of England and in 1086 was a thriving manor under the overlordship of Ilbert de Lacy. It gained its first charter from Maurice de Gant in 1207 yet grew but slowly throughout the medieval and Tudor periods. The town had become part of the Duchy of Lancaster and reverted to the crown in the medieval period, so was a Royalist stronghold at the start of the English Civil War.\\n\\n- Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.\\n\\n- Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere from goats, mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids.\\n\\n- A wind turbine is a device that converts the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power.\\n\\n- West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million.

CAA55 was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of 55 minutes 5 seconds, reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of Digital Audio. Several titles released between 1985 and 1987 were analog audio only due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc (e.g., Back to the Future). By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in CAA60, allowing a total of 60 minutes 5 seconds. Pioneer further refined CAA, offering CAA45, encoding 45 minutes of material, but filling the entire playback surface of the side. Used on only a handful of titles, CAA65 offered 65 minutes 5 seconds of playback time per side. There are a handful of titles pressed by Technidisc that used CAA50. The final variant of CAA is CAA70, which could accommodate 70 minutes of playback time per side. There are not any known uses of this format on the consumer market.;\\nQuestion: What was the maximum length of the CAA60 format?;\\nAnswer:","target":"60 minutes 5 seconds","rationale":"The context states that: \\"By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in CAA60\\".

Admired for the purity of her voice, she originally underwent classical training to become an opera singer before following a career in popular music, and by 1955 had achieved more worldwide record sales than any other female artist. Her 1952 song \\"You Belong to Me\\" topped the charts in the United States and United Kingdom, the record becoming the first by a female artist to reach number one on the U.K. Singles Chart.\\nBorn in Coalinga, California, Stafford made her first musical appearance at age twelve. While still at high school she joined her two older sisters to form a vocal trio named The Stafford Sisters, who found moderate success on radio and in film. In 1938, while the sisters were part of the cast of Twentieth Century Fox's production of Alexander's Ragtime Band, Stafford met the future members of The Pied Pipers and became the group's lead singer. Bandleader Tommy Dorsey hired them in 1939 to perform back-up vocals for his orchestra.\\nIn addition to her recordings with the Pied Pipers, Stafford featured in solo performances for Dorsey. After leaving the group in 1944, she recorded a series of pop standards for Capitol Records and Columbia Records. Many of her recordings were backed by the orchestra of Paul Weston. She also performed duets with Gordon MacRae and Frankie Laine. Her work with the United Service Organizations (USO) giving concerts for soldiers during World War II earned her the nickname \\"G.I. Jo\\". Starting in 1945, Stafford was a regular host of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio series The Chesterfield Supper Club and later appeared in television specials—including two series called The Jo Stafford Show, in 1954 in the U.S. and in 1961 in the U.K. contains an answer for the question: What are the full name of the people that Jo Elizabeth Stafford performed duets with?, what is it ?","target":"Frankie Laine","rationale":"Frankie Laine is the correct answer."},{"source":"Does the sentence \\"It has also been said by many that Sianis put a \\"curse\\" on the Cubs, apparently preventing the team from playing in the World Series.\\" answer the question \\"In what game was the Curse of the Billy Goat allegedly laid upon the Cubs?\\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The answer is no because the sentence does not explicitly mention which game was \\"the Cubs\\" allegedly cursed.

Excavated inscriptions record titles such as Mahapradhana (Chief minister), Sandhivigrahika, and Dharmadhikari (chief justice). Some positions such as Tadeyadandanayaka (commander of reserve army) were specialised in function while all ministerial positions included the role of Dandanayaka (commander), showing that cabinet members were trained as army commanders as well as in general administrative skills.The kingdom was divided into provinces such as Banavasi-12000, Nolambavadi-32000, Gangavadi-96000, each name including the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in Belavola-300. The big provinces were called Mandala and under them were Nadu further divided into Kampanas (groups of villages) and finally a Bada (village). A Mandala was under a member of the royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. Tailapa II himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the Rashtrakuta rule. Chiefs of Mandalas were transferable based on political developments. For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Someshvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000.

While in principle meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms enable agents to learn new skills from small amounts of experience, several major challenges preclude their practicality. Current methods rely heavily on on-policy experience, limiting their sample efficiency. They also lack mechanisms to reason about task uncertainty when adapting to new tasks, limiting their effectiveness in sparse reward problems. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing an off-policy meta-RL algorithm that disentangles task inference and control. In our approach, we perform online probabilistic filtering of latent task variables to infer how to solve a new task from small amounts of experience. This probabilistic interpretation enables posterior sampling for structured and efficient exploration. We demonstrate how to integrate these task variables with off-policy RL algorithms to achieve both meta-training and adaptation efficiency. Our method outperforms prior algorithms in sample efficiency by 20-100X as well as in asymptotic performance on several meta-RL benchmarks.","target":"Sample efficient meta-RL by combining variational inference of probabilistic task variables with off-policy RL","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nSample efficient meta-RL by combining variational inference of probabilistic task variables with off-policy RL."},{"source":"Question: Where could there be people making noise if no one is supervising the people?\\n\\nChoices: \\n- big city\\n- transmission\\n- classroom\\n- bowling alley\\n- in the front yard\\n\\nThe rationale to choose \\"classroom\\" as the answer is that:","target":"a classroom is the only one of these choices that is normally supervised.","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"a classroom is the only one of these choices that is normally supervised.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you're given the title of a five-sentence story, the first four sentences, and two options for the fifth sentence as a and b.

In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM.

Based on these statements it can be inferred that because both parents were alive when they named their son William Sterndale Benett (and not just Mr or Mrs), then only one could have been dead by 1819 meaning that either William's mother had already passed away before he was born or his father had since died between him being named and turning 3 years old.\\nBecause there is no mention of any other family members with the same last name who may have taken care of young William at age three, like grandparents"},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nParagraph :\\n\\nLower temperature and higher salinity yield the densest water.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nNoah compares the density of the water in a pond during a hot July day and a cold winter morning.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

That new notion of nationhood engendered a deep interest in the classical past culminating in the ideas of the Neoplatonist philosopher Gemistus Pletho, who abandoned Christianity. However, it was the combination of Orthodox Christianity with a specifically Greek identity that shaped the Greeks' notion of themselves in the empire's twilight years. The interest in the Classical Greek heritage was complemented by a renewed emphasis on Greek Orthodox identity, which was reinforced in the late Medieval and Ottoman Greeks' links with their fellow Orthodox Christians in the Russian Empire. These were further strengthened following the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461, after which and until the second Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29 hundreds of thousands of Pontic Greeks fled or migrated from the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands to southern Russia and the Russian South Caucasus (see also Greeks in Russia, Greeks in Armenia, Greeks in Georgia, and Caucasian Greeks).","target":"Greeks in Armenia","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"Greeks in Armenia\\"."},{"source":"Premise: Two men wearing yellow caution cones as hats and one is about to get hit with a ball to the head.\\n\\nHypothesis: The men are wearing pans on their heads.\\n\\n.Choose the correct answer: Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The premise mentions that two men are wearing yellow cones, not pans.

They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas. Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush. They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant. Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk.

Either way, I lost feelings for her toward the end when we had a falling out and I realized that I liked the idea of her but  I didn’t like HER (if that makes sense). We made up eventually and planned to move into an apartment together and were gonna share a room for our sophomore year of college. We also planned to share my queen size bed together since it was too much of a hassle for her to buy her own when she didn’t have a car and my car wouldn’t fit a mattress or bed frame (my parents drove up the queen size bed for me).\\n\\nAnyway I start dating a girl, “Ann,” over the summer and things are great and steady. I had told Ann everything about Jen after some time and although she was surprised at first (she had heard of Jen as my best friend but not as my past crush), she didn’t seem to make a big deal of it. After about three months, I had to go back to school (which would make us long distance). I told Ann that Jen and I were going share a bed throughout the year and she didn’t say much about it. She seemed to understand my reasoning about why, so we never discussed it further.\\n\\nI ended up casually telling one of my friends about my living situation (sharing a bed) and he was surprised and said it was weird. He told me to change the genders of the situation, “Imagine if you were a guy and sharing a bed with a previous crush—isn’t that messed up for your gf?” But Ann never said anything about it and she actually met Jen and they got along (at some point the three of us ended up sharing the bed because Ann slept over a few times), so I don’t think it’s a big deal.

Originally described by Carl Stål , the type species is Psaltoda moerens known as the redeye , and P. plaga is a well - known species from eastern Australia , known as the black prince . Fifteen species are recognised . Relationships of the species with each other remains unclear .\\n\\n- The cicadas (or ) are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. It is divided into the Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 1,300 species described from around the world; many undescribed species remain.\\n\\n- Leafhopper is a common name applied to any species from the family Cicadellidae. These minute insects, colloquially known as hoppers, are plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs, or trees. Their hind legs are modified for jumping, and are covered with hairs that facilitate the spreading of a secretion over their bodies that acts as a water repellent and carrier of pheromones. They undergo a partial metamorphosis, and have various host associations, varying from very generalized to very specific. Some species have a cosmopolitan distribution, or occur throughout the temperate and tropical regions. Some are pests or vectors of plant viruses and phytoplasmas. The family is distributed all over the world, and constitutes the second-largest hemipteran family, with at least 20,000 described species.\\n\\n- Angophora is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, described as a genus in 1797. It is endemic to Australia, where species are distributed in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. The centre of diversity is along the northern and central coast of New South Wales.\\n\\n- The Auchenorrhyncha (former synonym: \\"Cicadinea\\") suborder of the Hemiptera contains most of the familiar members of what was called the Homoptera  groups such as cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, and spittlebugs. The aphids and scale insects are the other well-known \\"Homoptera\\", and they are in the suborder Sternorrhyncha. Lesser-known insects largely regarded as Homoptera are the Coleorrhyncha. However, the taxonomic status of the Hemiptera and Homoptera is currently under investigation and discussion. See Heteroptera and Prosorrhyncha for more information.\\n\\n- The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of Hemipteran insects, in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but they are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which encase themselves in froth in springtime.\\n\\n- South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. It covers some of the most arid parts of the country. With a total land area of , it is the fourth-largest of Australia's states and territories. It has a total of 1.7 million people, and its population is the most highly centralised of any state in Australia, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs. Other population centres in the state are relatively small.\\n\\n- Queensland (abbreviated as QLD) is the second-largest and third-most-populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia. Situated in the north-east of the country, it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,750,500, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Often referred to as the \\"Sunshine State\\", Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy. Tourism in the state, fuelled largely by its warm tropical climate, is a major industry.\\n\\n- Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.\\n\\n- The Tettigarctidae, also known as the hairy cicadas, are a small relict (mostly extinct) family of primitive cicadas, containing a single genus Tettigarcta, with two extant species, one in southern Australia (\\"Tettigarcta crinita\\"), and the other in Tasmania (\\"Tettigarcta tomentosa\\"). Fossil taxa include \\"Paratettigarcta zealandica\\" from New Zealand.\\n\\n- Eucalyptus L'Heritier 1789 is a diverse genus of flowering trees and shrubs (including a distinct group with a multiple-stem mallee growth habit) in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. Members of the genus dominate the tree flora of Australia, and include the tallest known flowering plant on Earth. There are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of New Guinea and Indonesia. One species, \\"Eucalyptus deglupta,\\" ranges as far north as the Philippines. Of the 15 species found outside Australia, just nine are exclusively non-Australian. Species of eucalyptus are cultivated widely in the tropical and temperate world, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, China, and the Indian subcontinent. However, the range over which many eucalypts can be planted in the temperate zone is constrained by their limited cold tolerance. Australia is covered by of eucalypt forest, comprising three quarters of the area covered by native forest.\\n\\n- Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.\\n\\n- Psaltoda moerens, commonly known as the redeye, is an Australian species of cicada. It is distributed through the south-east of Australia, from southern Queensland to South Australia, as well as Tasmania. Populations can vary greatly between years; one year they may be present in large numbers and the next they may be entirely absent. They feed primarily on eucalyptus but also on \\"Angophora\\" trees. As they feed on tree sap they expel small droplets of clear waste fluid. When numbers are high, this can form a constant stream.\\n\\n- The Hemiptera or true bugs are an order of insects comprising some 50,000 to 80,000 species of groups such as the cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, and shield bugs. They range in size from to around , and share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts. The name \\"true bugs\\" is sometimes limited to the suborder Heteroptera.

It was opened in five phases between 1980 and 1984, and was Britain's first urban light rail transit system; two extensions were opened in 1991 and 2002. It was developed from a combination of existing and newly built tracks and stations, with deep-level tunnels constructed through Newcastle city centre. A bridge was built across the Tyne, between Newcastle and Gateshead, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. The network is operated by DB Regio on behalf of Nexus and carries over 37 million passengers a year, extending as far as Newcastle Airport, Tynemouth, South Shields and South Hylton in Sunderland. In 2004, the company Marconi designed and constructed the mobile radio system to the underground Metro system.

It's like a super formal black tie mixer party for their current and potential clients, and she said she needs me to be her date. She has severe social anxiety, so I really want to be there for her (although I don't look forward to mingling with people because as I said, I'm antisocial as well).

Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children.\\nIf Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas.\\nCreativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something.\\nUnluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems.\\nIt is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.\\n\\n- A multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments at a professional level. Multi-instrumentalists who play closely related instruments, a practice known as doubling are common in orchestra (e.g., flute players who double on piccolo and percussion players, who play snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, etc.), in jazz (e.g., saxophone players who double on clarinet or flute; or double bass players who also play electric bass); in music theatre pit orchestras (e.g., reed players who are required to play numerous reed instruments); and in other areas of classical music (e.g., church piano players are often expected to play the church's pipe organ or Hammond organ as well). Popular music composers and songwriters are often multi-instrumentalists. In pop and rock, it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be multi-instrumentalists on instruments that are not from the same family: it is common for pop and rock musicians to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording.\\n\\n- Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes.\\n\\n- A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". \\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n- Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: \\"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres  drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\\"\\n\\n- Baduizm is the debut album by American R&B and neo soul singer-songwriter Erykah Badu, released on February 11, 1997 by Kedar Records. After leaving university in order to concentrate on music full-time, Badu then began touring with her cousin, Robert \\"Free\\" Bradford, where she recorded a 19-song demo, \\"Country Cousins\\", which attracted the attention of Kedar Massenburg. He set Badu up to record a duet with D'Angelo, \\"Your Precious Love,\\" and eventually signed her to a record deal with Universal Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during January to October 1996 at Battery Studios in New York City, Sigma Sounds & Ivory Studios in Philadelphia, and Dallas Sound Lab in Dallas.\\n\\n- Erykah Abi Wright (born Erica Abi Wright; February 26, 1971), better known by her stage name Erykah Badu, is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, disc jockey, activist, and actress.

Her first album, \\"Baduizm\\", was released on February 11, 1997. It spawned three singles: \\"On & On\\", \\"Next Lifetime\\" and \\"Otherside of the Game\\". The album was certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\\nBadu's first live album, \\"Live\\", was released on November 18, 1997 and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.\\n\\n- Neo soul is a genre of popular music. The term was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.\\n\\n- Roy Ayers (born September 10, 1940) is an American funk, soul, and jazz composer and vibraphone player. Ayers began his career as a post-bop jazz artist, releasing several albums with Atlantic Records, before his tenure at Polydor Records beginning in the 1970s, during which he helped pioneer jazz-funk. He is a key figure in the acid jazz movement, which is a mixture of jazz into hip-hop and funk, and has been dubbed by many as \\"The Godfather of Neo Soul\\". He is most well known for his signature compositions \\"Everybody Loves The Sunshine\\" and \\"Searchin\\", and is also famous for having more sampled hits by rappers than any other artist.\\n\\n- William \\"Kedar\\" Massenburg is an American record producer and record label executive, who was the president of Motown Records from 1997 to 2004.

It was recorded between 1999 and 2000 at Electric Lady Studios in New York and released on November 21, 2000, by Motown Records. A neo soul album, \\"Mama's Gun\\" incorporates funk, soul, and jazz styles. It has confessional lyrics by Badu, which cover themes of insecurity, social issues and personal relationships. The album has been viewed by critics as a female companion to neo soul artist D'Angelo's second album \\"Voodoo\\" (2000), which features a similar musical style and direction. Critics have also noted that while \\"Baduizm\\" contained its share of cryptic lyricism, \\"Mama's Gun\\" is much more direct in its approach, and places the artist in a subjective position more than its predecessor.\\n\\n- Polydor is a British record label and company, that operates as part of Universal Music Group. It has a close relationship with Universal's Interscope Geffen A&M label, which distributes Polydor's releases in the United States. In turn, Polydor distributes Interscope releases in the United Kingdom. Polydor Records Ltd. was established in 1954 British subsidiary in London by German Deutsche Grammophon GmbH. It was renamed in 1972 to Polydor Ltd.\\n\\n- The vibraphone (also known as the vibraharp or simply the vibes) is a musical instrument in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion family.\\n\\n- Musical collective is a phrase used to describe a group of musicians who collaborate over time to perform, record or compose music.\\n\\n- \`\` Cleva '' is the third and final single from American singer Erykah Badu 's second studio album , Mama 's Gun ( 2000 ) .

The song peaked at number seventy - seven on the Hot R&B / Hip - Hop Songs chart . It includes Roy Ayers on vibraphone .\\n\\n- Jazz-funk is a subgenre of jazz music characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers. The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.\\n\\n- Yasiin Bey (born Dante Terrell Smith; December 11, 1973), best known by his stage name Mos Def, is an American hip hop recording artist, actor and activist from Brooklyn, New York City, New York. Best known for his music, Mos Def embarked on his hip hop career in 1994, alongside his siblings in the short-lived rap group Urban Thermo Dynamics (UTD), after which he appeared on albums by Da Bush Babees and De La Soul. He subsequently formed the duo Black Star, alongside fellow Brooklyn-based rapper Talib Kweli, and released their eponymous debut album in 1998. He was featured on the roster of Rawkus Records and in 1999 released his solo debut, \\"Black on Both Sides\\".

At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century.\\nThey end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth.

I hate him for this.\\n\\n\\n\\nA little background info:\\n\\nMy parents have been divorced since I was 15, I'm 25 now. He cheated on my mother while stationed in South America and married her a year or so after the divorce. He then had a couple children with her, a son and daughter, a little later on. This was obviously upsetting for me, but did not ruin my relationship with him. I still loved him dearly. We didn't talk or see each other much since he got sent to Japan for the majority of the past decade, but he would come back once a year or so and we would spend a couple days together. He retired from the Air Force in late 2017 and began work as a civilian contractor back in the states in February of 2018.\\n\\nI don't know why, but we still rarely talked. The last time I spoke to him was January of 2017. This is now my absolutely deepest regret. I wish so much that I tried to reach out and tell him that I loved him more often...\\n\\nI got a call at 4 am on a Monday morning from his wife telling me that he had shot and killed himself. So I drove over 20 hours to be with her, my very young half siblings, and my grandparents. While there, I learned that my dad and stepmother had gotten into an argument due to him drinking excessively, so he was drunk when he did it. Apparently he would drink quite a bit almost every single night. It escalated into a very heated screaming match. She said she was going to call the cops. Apparently he told her, \\"If you call the cops, then it's all over\\". She ended up locking herself in the bathroom (not to call them, just to calm down) and while she was in there, she heard a gunshot come from the living room. My dad had shot himself in the head with an AK-47. \\n\\nNow to get to the point. \\n\\nI recently expressed to my sister that as much as I love my father and am still absolutely devastated, heartbroken and confused. I also *hate* him for what he's done.

Am I an asshole for bringing these feelings up to my sister?","target":"yes","rationale":"What the author's father did was wrong and unethical. The author is right in feeling angry at his father for committing suicide. Feeling angry and expressing anger is a normal part of grief, so the author should not feel guilty about expressing their feelings to their sister. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"\\"Am I an asshole for thinking this way?\\"\\" is \\"\\"no.\\"\\". However, what happened to the author's dad was very upsetting and it can be difficult for people to understand how others are feeling during these situations. Sometimes it may be best not to talk about how you feel with other people or at least try your best not to judge them if they do not understand you or share your feelings. Therefore, saying that your sister is an asshole because she does not understand how you are feeling probably isn't helpful and can cause more conflict than necessary among family members who are already hurting from losing someone close to them. Therefore, saying that your sister is an asshole for being disappointed that you hate your dad for killing himself is wrong because she may have been judging herself harshly as well in addition to judging others harshly; hence we say 'yes' here.\\""},{"source":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\\nArticle: On Sept. 11, an unseen enemy launched an attack on economic, military and governmental\\nLandmarks  of the United States.\\nBeyond the tremendous  loss of innocent lives and physical property, the attack was clearly aimed at the ideals of America--our values and the economic system that has made the U.S. economy the envy of the world.\\nThose responsible for these acts portray the United States as the embodiment of all that is evil\\nWith globalization and the worldwide economy it has spawned.

According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.

As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.\\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015.\\nThere is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.\\nIn 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally.

The word derives from the Greek , meaning \\"concurrence\\". In some instances a syndrome is so closely correlated with a pathogenesis or etiology that the words \\"syndrome\\", \\"disease\\", and \\"disorder\\" end up being used interchangeably for them. This is especially true of inherited syndromes. For example, Down syndrome, WolfHirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the \\"syndrome\\" nomenclature. In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms.\\n\\n- An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language.

This formulation shows the connection between the standard GAN training process and the primal-dual subgradient methods for convex optimization. The inherent connection does not only provide a theoretical convergence proof for training GANs in the function space, but also inspires a novel objective function for training. The modified objective function forces the distribution of generator outputs to be updated along the direction according to the primal-dual subgradient methods.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6.\\nLépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave.

By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took a back seat to his official duties as a professor of chemistry.\\nOnly Rimsky-Korsakov actively pursued a full-time musical career, and he was under increasing fire from his fellow nationalists for much the same reason as Tchaikovsky had been. Like Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov had found that, for his own artistic growth to continue unabated, he had to study and master Western classical forms and techniques. Borodin called it \\"apostasy\\", adding, \\"Many are grieved at present by the fact that Korsakov has turned back, has thrown himself into a study of musical antiquity. I do not bemoan it. It is understandable....\\" Mussorgsky was harsher: \\"[T]he mighty kuchka had degenerated into soulless traitors.\\"Tchaikovsky's analysis of each of The Five was unsparing. While at least some of his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took.

However, the Church of Rome still regarded 25 March as the equinox (until 342) and used a different cycle to compute the day of the moon. In the Alexandrian system, since the 14th day of the Easter moon could fall at earliest on 21 March its first day could fall no earlier than 8 March and no later than 5 April. This meant that Easter varied between 22 March and 25 April. In Rome, Easter was not allowed to fall later than 21 April, that being the day of the Parilia or birthday of Rome and a pagan festival.The first day of the Easter moon could fall no earlier than 5 March and no later than 2 April.\\n\\nUntil 342 when did the Church of Rome think the vernal equinox fell?","target":"25 March","rationale":"The article mentions that the Roman Catholic Church considered the seasonal drift in the date of Easter undesirable.

This meant that Easter was starting appear earlier or later than it should have been each year based on its original intention being tied to springtime weather events like crops blooming etc..\\nTherefore, at least until 342 when Pope Julius I changed how Rome would calculate their dates around 343-354 AUC"},{"source":"\\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\").

Passage:As the German Sixth Army was encircled in Stalingrad, the Red Army undertook a series of wider attacks against the rest of Army Group South. These culminated on 2 January 1943 when the Red Army launched Operation Star and Operation Gallop, which between January and early February broke German defenses and led to the Soviet recapture of Kharkov, Belgorod, Kursk, as well as Voroshilovgrad and Izium. The Soviet victories caused participating Soviet units to over-extend themselves, though this was largely due to Manstein's strategy of controlled retreat towards the Dneiper. Freed on 2 February by the surrender of the German Sixth Army, the Red Army's Central Front turned its attention west and on 25 February expanded its offensive against both Army Group South and Army Group Center. Months of continuous operations had taken a heavy toll on the Soviet forces and some divisions were reduced to 1,000–2,000 combat effective soldiers. On 19 February, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein launched his Kharkov counterstrike, using the fresh II SS Panzer Corps and two panzer armies. Manstein benefited greatly from the massive air support of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen's Luftflotte 4, whose 1,214 aircraft flew over 1,000 sorties per day from 20 February to 15 March to support the German Army, a level of airpower equal to that during the Case Blue strategic offensive a year earlier.\\n Links: a. 6th Army (Wehrmacht) b.

In males, FSH stimulates sperm maturation, which is inhibited by the hormone inhibin. The steroid hormone testosterone, a type of androgen, is released in response to LH and is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of the male reproductive system, as well as the development of male secondary sex characteristics. In females, FSH promotes egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone. Both of these hormones are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system, as well as maintaining pregnancy. The placenta develops during early pregnancy, and secretes several hormones important for maintaining the pregnancy.\\n\\n\\nQ: The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) produced by what gland?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"pituitary","rationale":"The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

While we can't go back, we certainly can offer our sons and daughters our best advice to help them make the right choices in college. Hopefully, they will have fewer regrets than we do. Following are five guidelines parents can share with their college-bound kids to put the whole experience in perspective.\\nEDUCATION IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY\\nAs soon as you arrive on campus, there will be competing interests. Feel free to check them out but always remember that you are there first and foremost for your education. Go to class prepared and on time. Be engaged during class. Make sure your professor knows you and realizes that you care.\\nBE RESPONSIBLE\\nThere are many layers of responsibility. Do what you say you will do and, if you can't, own up to it early and communicate clearly. But being responsible isn't just about meeting your commitments; it is also about taking care of you, your body, and your friends. For example, more than 1800 college students die annually from alcohol-related injuries. Look out for yourself and other people. Make moderate, sensible decisions so you aren't reeling from the consequences later.\\nTAKE THE OPPORTUNITY\\nIncredible opportunities will present themselves: studying abroad, interning at a unique place, trying new things. Don't let fear prevent you from taking advantage of them. There may never be so much time or as many resources devoted to your betterment again in your life. Say yes to opportunities that will help you grow.\\nFIND AND BE A MENTOR\\nSome of the best lessons available to us can come outside of the classroom in the form of a mentor. One of the most powerful growth opportunities is being a mentor. Early on, find someone on campus who you feel can help you grow and develop a relationship with him or her.

She asks Clarence if the chalkboard looks blurry and he says that it looks clear to him. Molly will ask her mom about it when she gets home from school today.\\n\\nHint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.","target":"Molly","rationale":"The paragraph indicates that Clarence, in contrast to Molly, has no problem seeing what is on the board. Therefore it can be inferred that only one of them must have difficulty reading things from afar and thus suffer nearsightedness.

It also seems probable for kids who spend a lot of time doing close visual work such as reading or working at a computer may become more prone towards developing issues like myopia than others since they would strain their eyes too much while doing so.

By the end of the century, King Harald Fairhair  managed, mainly due to the military superiority gained by his alliance with Sigurd Ladejarl of Nidaros, to subjugate these mini-kingdoms, and he created a unified Norwegian state. This alliance came apart after Harald's death. The jarls of Lade and various descendants of Harald Fairhair would spend the next century interlocked in feuds over power. As well as power politics, religion also played a part in these conflicts, as two of the descendants of Harald Fairhair, Hakon the Good and Olaf Tryggvason attempted to convert the then heathen Norwegians to Christianity. In the year 1000, Svein  and Erik  of Lade took control over Norway, being supported by the Danish King Svein. In 1015, Olaf Haraldsson, representing the descendants of Harald Fairhair, returned from one of his Viking trips and was immediately elected as King of Norway.  In June 1016, he won the Battle at Nesjar against the Jarls of Lade. Olav Haraldsson's success in becoming King of Norway was helped by the Danes being kept occupied with the ongoing fighting in England. In the year 1028, the Danish King Cnut the Great made an alliance with the Lades, and Olaf had to go into exile in Kievan Rus .

Additionally, he's worked 27 years of his live to support the marriage and is currently retired at 59. Since I'm 16, I have trouble remembering exactly how far this goes back, but I remember that at least over the last 4 years my mom has been abusive. We think that she's developed some form of bipolar disorder but we can't be sure because she refuses to get herself assessed. She's been in denial over the state of my parents' marriage, called my dad a drunk loser and harassed him when he was struggling with his alcohol addiction, falsely accused him many times of having an affair with absolutely no substantial reason to believe so, and refuses to accept that she's wrong (one time yelling at us because we disagreed with her about Jell-O being healthy). Moreover, she's said that hitting her kids makes her \\"feel like she's doing her motherly duty\\" and one time pushed my dad to the floor (when he was 58). I feel like for the majority of my life my dad has been the only one I can turn to because he can understand me and my brother and manages to be rational. My dad has been nothing but a selfless giver to my family, and my mom still complains about what he provides and calls him manipulative.

The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set the rules and regulations that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With the exception of a few who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.\\nWell-to-do men wore the Petha or Kulavi, a tall turban made of silk and decorated with gold. As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used by men and women and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of rose water, civet musk, musk or sandalwood.

All other Alien movies had titles that end with the word death. Aliens (1986): The Name of the Planet: Death; Alien³ (1992): Final Solution: Death; Alien: Resurrection (1997): The Resurrection of Death. Bolaji Badejo who plays the Alien in the movie, was a graphic artist, who was discovered at a pub by one of the casting directors. He was seven feet one inch tall with thin arms, just what they needed to fit into the Alien costume. The Alien Quadrilogy box set was released December 2, 2003, with both versions of the film included along with a new commentary track featuring many of the film's actors, writers, and production staff, as well as other special features and a documentary entitled The Beast Within: The Making of Alien. Each film was also released separately as a DVD with both versions of the film included. Sigourney Weaver on Alien sequel: 'There's more story to tell' The actor, who played Ripley in four Alien movies, has said that she would like to return to the iconic character Ben Beaumont-Thomas In the years since the release of Alien, the Alien has become one of the world's most recognized movie monsters and a popular-cultural icon. In 2003, the Alien was voted as the 14th most memorable screen villain by the American Film Institute. The Alien Quadrilogy is a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the four Alien films. Although previously available on DVD as the Alien Legacy, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. The American Film Institute ranked Alien as the sixth most thrilling American movie and seventh-best film in the science fiction genre, and in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list, Ripley was ranked eighth among the heroes, and the Alien was fourteenth among the villains. Aliens is a sequel to Alien (1979), which was based on an original screenplay by Dan O'Bannon. The screenplay for Aliens was written by Canadian-American film-maker James Cameron, who also directed the movie. There have since been four sequels: Alien³ (1992) (1992), Alien: Resurrection (1997) (1997), AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) (2004), and AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem (2007)) (2007).

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century \\nWhat neologism can be applied to Madame White Snake? \\nWould it be good to answer \\"One could call Madame White Snake a liberated woman\\"?","target":"No","rationale":"No choice is correct. \\nThe text simply asked the question: \\"What neologism can be applied to Madame White Snake?"},{"source":"Read the following article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: Some school officials  want to change class time from 8:00am to 9:00am.What do you think?\\nJill----\\"I think it's a good idea!

However, to say that the LNM was an all-Muslim organization would be a gross oversimplification. Its main ideological positions were: the abrogation of sectarianism, political and social reforms, the clear proclamation of the Arab identity of Lebanon, and increased support for the Palestinians. In order to coordinate the military and political actions of the LNM an executive structure, the Central Political Council – CPC (Arabic: Majliss Tajammu al-kinda) or Bureau Politique Central (BPC) in French was set up shortly after the outbreak of the hostilities at the town of Aley, a mountain tourist resort in the Chouf District, which became the military Headquarters of the Front. The Council was presided since its inception by Kamal Jumblatt of the PSP, with Muhsin Ibrahim of the OCAL appointed as Executive Secretary; after Kamal's death in 1977, he was replaced by his son Walid Jumblatt, who continued to lead the LNM until 1982.","target":"b","rationale":"The question asks for the age at death of the leader of \\"The Council\\", which is mentioned directly in the passage as \\"Kamal Jumblatt\\".
