She was an associate professor of history at Nassau Community College (1994-2007) and now teaches at The New School in New York City. Hecht has seven published books, her scholarly articles have been published in many journals and magazines, and her poetry has appeared in The New Yorker, The New Republic, Ms. Magazine, and Poetry Magazine, among others. She has also written essays and book reviews for The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The American Scholar, The Boston Globe and other publications.\\n\\nHecht believes that, \\"the basic modern assumptions about how to be happy are nonsense.\\" In a review of her book, The Happiness Myth for The New York Times, Alison McCulloch summed it up, \\"What you think you should do to be happy, like getting fitter and thinner, is part of a 'cultural code' -- 'an unscientific web of symbolic cultural fantasies' -- and once you realize this, you will perhaps feel a little more free to be a lot more happy.\\" Similarly, in an interview on the Point of Inquiry podcast in 2007, she said \\"I'm not trying really to get somebody out of depression, but I sure am trying to get people to not be so worried, so anxious over things that really don't matter.\\"  She has written against agnosticism, calling \\"philosophically silly\\" the argument that because you can't prove a negative we have to allow for the possibility of God. \\"Either you doubt everything to the point where you can't speak, or you make reasoned decisions.\\"  Hecht is an anti-suicide advocate, writing an entire book (Stay: A History of Suicide and the Philosophies Against It) arguing against it. She believes not only that \\"Suicide is delayed homicide\\", but also \\"that you owe it to your future self to live\\". She does not believe in life-after-death, urging that we should remember death and remember that it's the end. \\"I think this world is extraordinary and I also think it's a pain in the ass. And I'm happy to be here and I'm ok with not being here forever.\\"  She believes that morality is not magical, it is the attempt to do right. And rather than either being handed to us by God or just made up by each person, is inherent in human groups. \\"There are deep rules of morality that we as human beings, in human groups, 'invented' on biological and social and intellectual lines.\\"  Her poetry and philosophy often intersect, and she has taught a course called \\"Poets and Philosophy\\" at the New School for many years. Her own taste is for poets who are concerned with philosophical or religious questions. \\"Leopardi's misery makes me as happy as Schopenhauer's does, though I am ever aware of the equal cacophony of birth and pleasure that shadow their admittedly much more deafening symphony of death and suffering.

Hopkins has a few rhyming hunks of pure passion, frustrated but wild, which I love with a love that is more than a love, but which only go so far. Donne is deep and great company, but he leans too much into comforting delusions for me, often when he is at his best in poetic chops and pyrotechnics.

This may have resulted from Alfred Burges's engineering firm, Walker, Burges and Cooper, having undertaken work on the East Bute Docks in Cardiff for the second Marquess. The 3rd Marquess became Burges's greatest architectural patron; both were men of their times; both had fathers whose industrial endeavours provided the means for their sons' architectural achievements, and both sought to \\"redeem the evils of industrialism by re-living the art of the Middle Ages\\".On his succession to the Marquessate at the age of one, Bute inherited an income of £300,000 a year, and, by the time he met Burges, he was considered the richest man in Britain, if not the world. Bute's wealth was important to the success of the partnership: as Burges himself wrote, \\"Good art is far too rare and far too precious ever to be cheap.\\" But, as a scholar, antiquarian, compulsive builder and enthusiastic medievalist, Bute brought more than money to the relationship and his resources and his interests allied with Burges's genius to create what McLees considers to be \\"Bute's most memorable overall achievement.\\"\\nHowever occasioned, the connection lasted the rest of Burges's life and led to his most important works. To the Marquess and his wife, Burges was the \\"soul-inspiring one\\". The architectural writer Michael Hall considers Burges's rebuilding of Cardiff Castle and the complete reconstruction of the ruin of Castell Coch, north of the city, as representing his highest achievements. In these buildings, Crook contends that Burges escaped into \\"a world of architectural fantasy\\" which Hall describes as \\"amongst the most magnificent the Gothic Revival ever achieved.\\" contains an answer for the question: What specific meeting may have resulted from Alfred Burges's engineering firm having undertaken work on the East Bute Docks in Cardiff for the second Marquess?, what is it ?","target":"Burges met John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute","rationale":"The paragraph contains the following line: \\"This may have resulted from Alfred Burges's engineering firm, Walker, Burges and Cooper, having undertaken work on the East Bute Docks in Cardiff for the second Marquess.\\" This implies that a meeting occurred which was likely to be related to this project.

Heterogeneity was assessed using the I statistic. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were planned according to study design, specific steroid, and mean gestational age at birth. A single course of antenatal corticosteroids was associated with reduced risk for cerebral palsy (seven studies; treated: 390 of 5,199, untreated: 146 of 1,379; RR 0.678, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.564-0.815), psychomotor development index less than 70 (two studies; treated: 783 of 3,049, untreated: 258 of 969; RR 0.829, 95% CI 0.737-0.933), and severe disability (five studies; treated: 1,567 of 4,840, untreated: 475 of 1,211; RR 0.787, 95% CI 0.729-0.850).

In other words, Keats's fear is that death is a 'nothingness' that will arrive before he can finish his life's work or find his true love.\\nDonne has a different attitude toward death, and so the imagery in his poem is different, too.To Donne, death should 'be not proud,' because it is not 'mighty and dreadful.' Unlike Keats, Donne sees death as weak and merely a 'slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men.' He also says that death is like 'rest and sleep'.Donne believes that we will all wake from the sleep of death to everlasting life, just as we wake from our normal sleep to our everyday lives.In fact, Donne believes that it is death itself that will die: 'One short sleep past, we wake forever,/ And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.'\\nKeats and Donne both know that death is a prat of life, and both poets use powerful imagery to talk about that difficult theme.The differences in this imagery show two very different attitudes toward the subject, one of...\\nQuestion: According to the passage,   _   makes Keats's life worth living.\\nYes or no, is the answer \\"expressing his grand passion for poetry\\"?","target":"No","rationale":"The answer is \\"No\\".

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success.\\nDue to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success.

Passage:After the war he spent another eight years organising tourist services between Iraq, Persia (now Iran) and Syria for the Mesopotamian Trading Agency of Ashar, Basrah. His wife may have joined him in 1924. He returned to South Australia in 1926 with the intention of setting up a regular service between Adelaide and Darwin via Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. He conducted a demonstration run with eight men and four women in three Studebaker cars and a Thornycroft truck, leaving Adelaide on 18 May and arrived in Darwin on 3 June; left there on 7 June and returned to Adelaide on 25 June, travelling via Camooweal, Queensland and Marree, South Australia, publicised by Duncan and Fraser (agents for both Thornycroft and Studebaker) and as they were equipped with a short-wave transceiver, gave nightly reports on radio 5CL. Despite a second successful round trip that year, Bagot abandoned his idea of regular service when the Commonwealth Government turned down his application for a subsidy. He found employment with General Motors and in 1930 \\"Captain Bagot\\" as he was called by admirers (or \\"'Alphabetical Bagot' as he was known to the many who disliked him), founded the Citizens' League of South Australia, which opposed Unionism, Communism and the White Australia Policy as benefiting the working classes, yet also opposing Fascism. This was the time of the Great Depression and he also supported the Young People's Employment Council and the Rev. Samuel Forsyth's (1881–1960) Forsyth Industrial Colony \\"Kuitpo Colony\\" near Kuitpo Forest, which was training boys as farm workers. The Citizen's League attempted political influence by promising support to political candidates, and was a factor in the election of the Independent candidate George Connor to the Assembly seat of Alexandra in 1934.","target":"b","rationale":"The question only asks for the age of George Connor when he was elected to the Assembly seat of Alexandra.

The Texans would add onto their lead in the second quarter as quarterback Matt Schaub completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to Slaton and a 42-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels. However, the 49ers began to rally in the third quarter with quarterback Alex Smith hooking up with tight end Vernon Davis on a 29-yard touchdown pass.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\nQuestion: Which historical event was compared to releasing prisoners from Cuba?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.","target":"One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews","rationale":"The context describes the Crusades, a series of wars between Christians and Muslims for control over Palestine.

Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication.

Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin.

These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently.

This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used ,2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (,80%) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual's home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic's final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments.

Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.\\n\\n- The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe.

Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides numerical information about the sensitivity and specificity of flow cytometry (FCM) for detecting bladder carcinoma. The false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for conventional cytology was 40.9%. Therefore, there are some values in this abstract that represent measurements or results from experiments. So the answer is “Yes”."},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was listed at his job on the time sheets as \\"Elephant?\\"\\n\\nPaul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham.

As well as minting circulating coins for use domestically and internationally, the mint also produces planchets, commemorative coins, various types of medals and precious metal bullion. The mint exports to an average of 60 countries a year, making up 70% of its total sales. Formed over 1,100 years ago, the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England, all of Great Britain and eventually most of the British Empire. The original London mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor was established in 886 AD and operated within the Tower of London for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court where it remained until the 1960s.

Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture.

I never really wanted children, but K was very insistent about wanting a child, and I decided to put her needs above mine on this issue, given how important it is to her. \\n\\nSo we had a son 2 years ago, and I've thrown myself into it completely - the kid is great, and I put in a ton of effort trying to be a good dad. Essentially I work a full day every day, spend \\\\~3 hours hanging out with my son after I come home, then jump back on my laptop to do more work after he goes down to bed. I carry my weight in terms of diaper changing, putting him to bed, feeding him, playing with him, daycare drop-off, etc.\\n\\nThe issue that's arisen is my wife's work travel schedule. She's in a really demanding job, and in 2015 - 16 (before our son was born), she was put on a project that required her to be away from home / out of state quite frequently. At the time it was happening, she assured me that this was a pretty atypical project, and that I shouldn't expect her to be away from home so frequently in the future.\\n\\nFast forward to 2018, and another project related to the 2015 - 2016 one arises, so she ends up traveling quite a bit. This is in addition to a decent amount of social travel, as she has 3 separate friend groups she goes on out-of-town trips with once or twice a year. In total, between work and social, she's been gone about \\\\~60 days total in the past year. On those days, I've been left to fend for myself with our son. I love him, but it's a ton of work taking care of him 1:1 for long stretches, and it's started to really bother me from the standpoint that I've already stuck my neck out / completely rearranged my life to make K happy by having a kid (even though it's not something I'd have wanted on my own), I've fully embraced the role of being a dad, and now on top of that I feel like I'm having my goodwill exploited by her leaving me as a solo parent for 2 months out of the year. Full disclosure: I'm away for work \\\\~30 days out of the year, so I do this to her sometimes, but 1) that's a full month less than she's gone; 2) I've significantly cut down on discretionary social travel since our son was born; and 3) again, despite how much I adore our son, we had a child specifically to make her happy, and specifically at the expense of a life I was completely happy with.\\n\\nSo things came to a head a few days back, when she (on one day's notice) told me she had to go on another 2-day work trip. I told her we needed to talk about this, as I was unhappy about how frequently she's been gone, and I didn't want the rest of my life to be like this. She alternated between 1) getting super upset with me and saying stuff to the effect of \\"fine, I'll just find another job\\" in a pissed-off, passive-aggressive manner; 2) arguing with me that her travel schedule won't be as bad once this project ends this spring; and 3) insisting that she hadn't been away from home much more than I had in 2018.\\n\\nWith regard to 1), I'd honestly be thrilled if she found another job, and I told her that. The problem is she absolutely loves her current job and is good at it. There are other, related jobs she could move into that would have better work-life balance and fewer travel requirements. The downside is that they'd pay less and be less personally fulfilling to K. My sense is that she thinks my desire for her to change jobs is tantamount to my wanting her to be barefoot and in the kitchen, which is a little ridiculous - if she were to change jobs, she'd still be in a role that is very well respected (certainly more well respected than mine) and would still be paid quite well (albeit not as well as she currently is). \\n\\nWith regard to 2), it's possible that her travel schedule will normalize after this project is over, but that's what she told me in 2015 - 16 as well, and here we are in the present.

Meanwhile, she's taken this to mean that I'm strong-arming her into finding a new job, and so she's started putting out feelers while also acting incredibly pissed off toward me (snapping at me occasionally, sleeping in the guest bedroom) for the last several days. I'm debating whether I'm going to cave in and just tell her to stay at her current job (since I'm kind of a softie and really do care about her happiness), even if it potentially causes me to be miserable for the rest of my life, or whether I'm going to stay silent on the issue and see how it plays out.\\n\\nIn any case, I know the point here is not to ask for advice.

This something is someone now: Pope Francis. In a strong, apparently unscripted move on his recent visit to Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, on Sunday the pontiff suddenly waved to the driver of his Popemobile, asking to get out. Surrounded by guards and by children waving Palestinian flags, he got out, walked over to the wall that separates Israel from its Palestinian neighbors, and he did something remarkably simple but with astonishing power: He prayed. This symbolic gesture occurred at a well-known portion of the wall, a segment covered with graffiti. Somebody had spray-painted a message in black: \\"Pope we need some 1 to speak about justice Bethlehem look like Warsaw ghetto.\\" In bold red letters the Pope could read: \\"Free Palestine.\\" While Israeli guards looked anxiously down from a nearby tower, wondering what on Earth was going on, Francis touched the wall with his right hand, bent his head, and prayed for several minutes.

The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores. A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the 'cydippids' are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.

Pendulum originally formed in the city of Perth, Western Australia by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen, and Paul \\"El Hornet\\" Harding. The band was later expanded to include members, Ben Mount, Peredur ap Gwynedd, and KJ Sawka. Members Swire and McGrillen also formed the electro house duo Knife Party.\\n\\nWhen Pendulum was formed, their musical style was considerably more drum and bass sounding than the work they were known for later in their career. Signature tunes such as \\"Masochist\\", \\"Vault\\", \\"Back 2 You\\" and \\"Voyager\\", which were released on labels such as Uprising Records, 31 Records, Renegade Hardware and Low Profile Records, have a darker, more amelodic air to them which is substantially absent from their later productions. The band's newer work is regarded as generally leaning heavily towards a mainstream, dance-driven sound. Early work such as \\"Another Planet\\" seems to indicate an early affinity with a more global sound, similar to other Breakbeat Kaos artists such as DJ Fresh and Adam F.  The group has produced various remixes of other artists also; one of the best-known being the remix of \\"Voodoo People\\", originally by The Prodigy. In 2008-2010, they covered/remixed songs including Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\", Linkin Park's \\"The Catalyst\\", Calvin Harris's \\"I'm Not Alone\\", Coldplay's \\"Violet Hill\\", and Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\". Pendulum's versions of \\"I'm Not Alone\\" and \\"Master Of Puppets\\" both exist as studio recordings but have not been officially released, and are only previewed during DJ sets. The original live version of \\"Master of Puppets\\" was played as an instrumental introduction for \\"Slam\\", and was featured on their first live album/DVD. During their American tour as the supporting band for Linkin Park, the song was played in its entirety, with Rob doing vocals. Pendulum have also remixed their own music and, on occasion, television theme songs, such as Australian television's \\"ABC News Theme\\" in May 2010. The remix proved to be immensely popular with listeners of Australian youth radio station Triple J, polling at number 11 in the 2010 Triple J Hottest 100 countdown.  Pendulum's musical style consisted of a fusion of drum and bass (along with other electronic genres), alternative rock and heavy metal, with the inclusion of acoustic instruments. This creates a sound reminiscent of electronic rock, albeit with much more prominent drum and bass and, more recently, dubstep influences. Some songs, such as \\"Slam\\", \\"Propane Nightmares\\" and \\"Witchcraft\\" are synth-led, whilst others, such as \\"Showdown\\", \\"The Tempest\\" and \\"Comprachicos\\", are guitar-led. Bassist Gareth McGrillen stated in an interview on Channel 4 that they use 13 computers during the live performances, all of which are mixing the sounds produced by the instruments in real time. Rob Swire stated in issues of TJECK magazine and Rock Sound magazine that he would like to begin producing songs with a punk style to them, which Gareth clarified to mean \\"A raw, aggressive, less polished method of producing\\".

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state.

There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health.

Known as Emesa at the start of the first century AD, the city was at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire, and ruled by the Emesene dynasty, a client kingdom of the Romans. Nearly 2,000 years later, the looters—digging near the former site of a monument to Sampsiceramus—found a complex of rich tombs, and removed the grave goods. Their looting was uncovered because small golden plaques, adorning the burial shroud of the body in tomb 11, flaked off when disturbed. The next morning, children noticed these gold flakes mixed in with the earth and brought them to a bazaar, where it came to the attention of the police; it ultimately led to the arrest of the looters, and the confiscation of the grave objects. The objects, including the helmet, were then secured for the state collection by Emir Djaafar Abd el-Kader, curator of the National Museum of Damascus—even as merchants, eager to capitalise on the stories, hawked modern forgeries and unrelated ancient objects said to come from the tombs of Emesa.The prompt intervention of el-Kader, who investigated the finds and interrogated the looters, allowed the finds to be recovered and well-understood.

We get along exceptionally well, me and the family, and I'm basically a second son to them. I help out whenever possible (biggest thing I'm doing for them is assisting her husband with renovations at his MIL's house, which hes been needing for a good while) and do my best to be a good house guest. From my conversations with them, they enjoy having me over. Specifically relevant to this story, however, is that they bred a dog for me 3 years ago and so I live with them and my dog, who they assist in caring for along with 2 other dogs.\\n\\nSo I got my dog a $180 pet bed. Why? He tears up any and all beds he gets EXCEPT this one because the cover is durable. So I get a text this morning from her saying that the covers zipper got stuck and she decided to still put it down on the ground, leading to my dog eating a good chunk of the corner. I didnt read the bit about the corner getting chewed, so I was absolutely chill about it, figured it wasnt a problem, and called the pet bed sellers who sent me the warranty email and told me that the cover should be replaceable, all they need is a picture. I go downstairs to get a pic and I notice that the bed is tore up...still usable, just that the corner is now opened up and missing a bit of volume. I call my friends mom up and ask her what happened and she tells me that she decided to put the bed on the ground knowing that the zipper was broken because \\"it was so cold I had to\\". The thing that frustrates me about this is that she knows my dog chews up all the beds we get him (she had gotten 2 beds recently from Costco and I had gotten him one from Target before getting the new one...all of them he tore up) and she also knows that the beds cover was the SOLE reason why this bed has survived for so long without damage, so to just set it down knowing that it was busted and hoping for the best, in my opinion, was stupid. My other reason for being upset is that we didnt split the bill on this: I paid for the entirety of that bed. I dont have much money as it is (currently looking for work, just recently got let go from the military), but she was going to go out and buy another bed that was guaranteed to get eaten up, so I wanted to eat that cost for her and just get a bed I know he wont destroy, so to hear her be so nonchalant about the damage (her reasoning is that the warranty should cover the bed as well, when we dont know if it will) was pretty upsetting when I made a decision basically for both of us (she insists on taking care of the dog alongside me, however I can see someone pointing out that I'm an asshole for even having her help me care for my dog at all). \\n\\nI really dont have much room to be upset, considering they feed me and provide me shelter and are very loving and caring towards me, but I still FEEL like I have some room to be upset, as this was, frankly, a very stupidly easy to avoid situation that she could have seen from a mile away, and my ideal resolution is to have a conversation about it and plan out what to do if it happens again.

When I was in middle school, if you didn’t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for ‘after school help.’ It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter.\\nNow, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, “well Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.” This fellow student knew I didn’t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week’s assignment. He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week’s assignment required 6–7 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any ‘after school help!’\\nThis was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough. I know none of that is allowed these days, but those were both good deterrents for me!!\\nWhat happened before Scott was in utter disbelief?\\n\\nA. not enough information\\n\\nB.

When the Germans launched their winter offensive on 16 December 1944, the 9th, with no real combat experience, suddenly found itself engaged in heavy fighting. The Division saw its severest action at St. Vith, Echternach, and Bastogne, its units fighting in widely separated areas. Its stand at Bastogne held off the Germans long enough to enable the 101st Airborne Division to dig in for a defense of the city. After a rest period in January 1945, the Division prepared to drive across the Roer River. The offensive was launched on 28 February 1945 and the 9th crossed the Roer to Rheinbach, sending patrols into Remagen. On 7 March 1945, elements of the 9th Armored found that the Ludendorff Bridge was still standing. When German demolition charges failed to bring the bridge down, they crossed it, disarming and removing the remaining charges, which could have exploded at any time.

The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.\\n\\n- Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million.\\n\\n- Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism.\\n\\n- Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a \\"transitional\\" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe.\\n\\n- A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile.\\n\\n- Bosnia and Herzegovina (or ; B&H; Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: \\"Bosna i Hercegovina\\" / a   ), sometimes called Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH), and, in short, often known informally as Bosnia, is a country in Southeastern Europe located on the Balkan Peninsula. Sarajevo is the capital and largest city. Bordered by Croatia to the north, west, and south; Serbia to the east; Montenegro to the southeast; and the Adriatic Sea to the south, with a coastline about long surrounding the city of Neum. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland is a geographically larger region and has a moderate continental climate, with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a Mediterranean climate and plain topography.\\n\\n- A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.\\n\\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\\n\\n- Montenegro (or or ; Montenegrin: \\"Crna Gora\\" /   , meaning \\"Black Mountain\\") is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\").\\n\\n- The aftermath of World War II was the beginning of an era defined by the decline of the old great powers and the rise of two superpowers: the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States of America (USA), creating a bipolar world. Allied during World War II, the USA and the USSR became competitors on the world stage and engaged in what became known as the Cold War, so called because it never boiled over into open war between the two powers but was focused on espionage, political subversion and proxy wars. Western Europe and Japan were rebuilt through the American Marshall Plan whereas Eastern Europe fell in the Soviet sphere of influence and rejected the plan. Europe was divided into a US-led Western Bloc and a Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. Internationally, alliances with the two blocs gradually shifted, with some nations trying to stay out of the Cold War through the Non-Aligned Movement. The Cold War also saw a nuclear arms race between the two superpowers; some argue part of the reason that the Cold War never became a \\"hot\\" war was that the Soviet Union and the United States had nuclear deterrents against each other, leading to a mutually assured destruction standoff.\\n\\n- The Yugoslav Wars were a series of ethnically-based wars and insurgencies fought from 1991 to 2001 inside the territory of the former Yugoslavia. These wars accompanied and/or facilitated the breakup of the Yugoslav state, when its constituent republics declared independence, but the issues of ethnic minorities in the new countries (chiefly Serbs, Croats and Albanians) were still unresolved at the time the republics were recognized internationally. The wars are generally considered to be a series of separate but related military conflicts which occurred in, and affected, most of the former Yugoslav republics.\\n\\n- Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana.\\n\\n- The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFR Yugoslavia or SFRY) was the Yugoslav state that existed from its foundation in the aftermath of World War II until its dissolution in 1991 amid the Yugoslav Wars. It was a socialist state and a federation made up of six socialist republics: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia. In addition, it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia: Kosovo and Vojvodina.\\n\\n- Kosovo  is a disputed territory and partially recognised state in Southeast Europe that declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 as the Republic of Kosovo. Kosovo is landlocked in the central Balkan Peninsula. Its capital and largest city is Pristina. It is bordered by the Republic of Macedonia and Albania to the south, Montenegro to the west, and the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east. While Serbia recognises administration of the territory by Kosovo's elected government, it still continues to claim it as its own Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.\\n\\n- Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora.\\n\\n- The Croatian War of Independence was fought from 1991 to 1995 between Croat forces loyal to the government of Croatia -- which had declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) -- and the Serb - controlled Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) and local Serb forces , with the JNA ending its combat operations in Croatia by 1992 . In Croatia , the war is primarily referred to as the Homeland War ( Domovinski rat ) and also as the Greater - Serbian aggression ( Velikosrpska agresija ) . In Serbian sources , War in Croatia ( Rat u Hrvatskoj ) is the most commonly used public term . A majority of Croats wanted Croatia to leave Yugoslavia and become a sovereign country , while many ethnic Serbs living in Croatia , supported by Serbia , opposed the secession and wanted Croatia to remain a part of Yugoslavia . Most Serbs effectively sought a new Serb state within a Yugoslav federation , including areas of Croatia and Bosnia - Herzegovina with ethnic Serb majorities or significant minorities , and attempted to conquer as much of Croatia as possible . In 2007 , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) returned a guilty verdict against Milan Marti , one of the Serb leaders in Croatia , for having colluded with Slobodan Miloševi and others to create a \`\` unified Serbian state '' . Between 2008 and 2012 , the ICTY had prosecuted Croatian generals Ante Gotovina , Mladen Marka and Ivan ermak for alleged involvement in the crimes related to Operation Storm . ermak was acquitted outright , and the convictions of Gotovina and Marka were later overturned by an ICTY Appeals Panel . The International Court of Justice dismissed Croatia and Serbia genocide claims in 2015 . While it reaffirmed that serious crimes against civilians were committed by both sides and that these acts constitute some basic elements of genocide , it ruled that the genocidal intent was not present . The JNA tried to keep Croatia within Yugoslavia by occupying all of Croatia .

The song, written by Scott English and Larry Weiss, had previously been recorded by an all-female band known as the Shape and had been a hit on the UK Singles Chart for the British group Amen Corner. It had also been recorded by The Outsiders after they had reached the top ten with \\"Time Won't Let Me\\" in 1966. Contributing to the success of the American Breed's version of \\"Bend Me, Shape Me\\" was the excellent arrangement of the song by the band's record producer, Bill Traut, who added horns among other changes.

But since the Earth does rotate, the Coriolis force deflects these winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Keep Reading Below In the Northern Hemisphere, this deflection causes the wind flow around high pressure systems to go clockwise while flow around low-pressure systems travels counterclockwise. Global winds. Earth’s orbit around the sun and its rotation on a tilted axis causes some parts of Earth to receive more solar radiation than others. This uneven heating produces global circulation patterns. offsite link For example, the Since aircraft cover large distances in a short period of time, pilots must also take its influence into account when charting the paths for their flights. For instance, a plane headed from Miami (where the Earth's rotation is more pronounced) to New York would end up in the Atlantic Ocean if the pilot ignored the effects of the Earth's rotation. 1 2 How do temp & salinity affect the formation of deep currents The colder the temp of water is the higher amound of salinity in the water which makes the water more dense Disasters caused by el niño These global wind patterns drive large bodies of air called air masses. Air masses are thousands of feet thick and extend across large areas of the Earth. The location over which an air mass forms will determine its characteristics. For example, air over the tropical ocean becomes exceptionally hot and humid. Global winds. Earth’s orbit around the sun and its rotation on a tilted axis causes some parts of Earth to receive more solar radiation than others. This uneven heating produces global circulation patterns.offsite link For example, the abundance of energy reaching the equator produces hot humid air that rises high into the atmosphere. With a high-pressure system, air gets forced outward and the Earth's eastward spin creates a clockwise flow. In the Southern Hemisphere, the opposite takes place: Wind around low-pressure systems circles clockwise while wind around high-pressure systems circles counterclockwise.

His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker, where he made several high-profile and sometimes controversial covers. He is married to designer and editor\\n\\nHired by Tina Brown as a contributing artist in 1992, Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years. Spiegelman's first cover appeared on the February 15, 1993, Valentine's Day issue and showed a black West Indian woman and a Hasidic man kissing. The cover caused turmoil at The New Yorker offices. Spiegelman intended it to reference the Crown Heights riot of 1991 in which racial tensions led to the murder of a Jewish yeshiva student. Spiegelman had twenty-one New Yorker covers published, and submitted a number which were rejected for being too outrageous.  Within The New Yorker's pages, Spiegelman contributed strips such as a collaboration titled \\"In the Dumps\\" with children's illustrator Maurice Sendak and an obituary to Charles M. Schulz titled \\"Abstract Thought is a Warm Puppy\\". An essay he had published there on Jack Cole, the creator of Plastic Man, called \\"Forms Stretched to their Limits\\" was to form the basis for a book in 2001 about Cole called Jack Cole and Plastic Man: Forms Stretched to their Limits.  The same year, Voyager Company published a CD-ROM version of Maus with extensive supplementary material called The Complete Maus, and Spiegelman illustrated a 1923 poem by Joseph Moncure March called The Wild Party. Spiegelman contributed the essay \\"Getting in Touch With My Inner Racist\\" in the September 1, 1997 issue of Mother Jones.  Spiegelman's influence and connections in New York cartooning circles drew the ire of political cartoonist Ted Rall in 1999. In an article titled \\"The King of Comix\\" in The Village Voice, Rall accused Spiegelman of the power to \\"make or break\\" a cartoonist's career in New York, while denigrating Spiegelman as \\"a guy with one great book in him\\". Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded by sending a forged email under Rall's name to thirty professionals; the prank escalated until Rall launched a defamation suit against Hellman for $1.5 million. Hellman published a \\"Legal Action Comics\\" benefit book to cover his legal costs, to which Spiegelman contributed a back-cover cartoon in which he relieves himself on a Rall-shaped urinal.  In 1997, Spiegelman had his first children's book published: Open Me... I'm a Dog, with a narrator who tries to convince its readers that it is a dog via pop-ups and an attached leash. From 2000 to 2003 Spiegelman and Mouly edited three issues of the children's comics anthology Little Lit, with contributions from Raw alumni and children's book authors and illustrators.

(Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.There were two friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary was founded in the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh sometime before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars.

Her mother died when she was a child and her father is not around. As a student she has financial problems, so she is surprised when the couple Joan and Stuart Quinn (Connie Sellecca and David Dukes) decide to take her in their house for a small amount of rent. Little does Amy know that Joan is following her every step through secret cameras, and that she has a hidden agenda for her. Initially, Amy is very content living with the Quinns, believing that she has found the family she has never had. When she loses the university's financial aide through an administration error, Joan immediately steps in to take care of her. They both drink a large amount of wine, and then Joan announces that because she is infertile, they are looking for a surrogate mother.

She then agrees when the Quinns propose to pay for her college fees if she helps them out.\\nWhen Amy is a few months pregnant, Joan starts to show strange behavior. Amy feels smothered by Joan's overbearing attitude, feeling that she is being treated like a ten-year-old child.

If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age.

It is one of the most gene- and disease-rich chromosomes in the human genome. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 11 likely contains between 1,300 and 1,700 genes. A recent study shows that 11.6 genes per megabase, including 1,524 protein-coding genes and 765 pseudogenes can be found on chromosome 11.

They correspond to specific points on the DNA chain and refer to either an entire gene or part of one. The term can also be used to describe regions of the genome that have no genetic function but are still identifiable by their physical location. For example, there are eleven pairs of chromosomes in humans; each pair has two copies which may match each other completely or partially. It is possible for different versions (alleles) of a single gene to occur at the same locus; this condition is known as heterozygosity or heterozygousity..\\n- If you change \\"band\\" into \\"line\\", you will come up with \\"[Chromosome 11 (human)] has the same line as what genetic code with an end greater than [43898388]?\\".

In this study, several monoclonal antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein have been generated to examine distribution of the nucleocapsid in virus-infected cells and to study antigenic regions of the protein. Confocal microscopic analysis identified nucleocapsids packaged in vesicles in the perinuclear area indicating viral synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The monoclonal antibodies bound to the central and carboxyterminal half of the nucleocapsid protein indicating prominent exposure and immunogenicity of this part of the protein. Antibodies recognised both linear and conformational epitopes. Predictions of antigenicity using mathematical modelling based on hydrophobicity analysis of SARS nucleoprotein could not be confirmed fully. Antibody binding to discontinuous peptides provides evidence that amino acids 274-283 and 373-382 assemble to a structural unit particularly rich in basic amino acids. In addition, amino acids 286-295, 316-325 and 361-367 that represent the epitope recognised by monoclonal antibody 6D11C1 converge indicating a well-structured C-terminal region of the SARS virus nucleocapsid protein and functional relationship of the peptide regions involved. Alternatively, dimerisation of the nucleocapsid protein may result in juxtaposition of the amino acid sequences 316-325 and 361-367 on one nucleoprotein molecule to amino acid 286-295 on the second peptide.

The first which was released in promotion of the album was Dance Gavin Dance's cover of That's What I Like originally performed by Bruno Mars, it was released on June 1, 2017 alongside the announcement of the Punk Goes Pop Vol. 7, it was accompanied by a music video. The second single to be released off the album was The Amity Affliction's cover of Can't Feel My Face originally performed by The Weeknd, it was released on June 22, 2017. It was also accompanied by a music video depicting zombie teenagers walking around eating people in a school and a group of people trying to kill them.

After that they are blown away by the lead singer of Grayscale with a leaf blower and the audience begins to dance around.

It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.\\n\\n- A music video game, also commonly known as a music game, is a video game where the gameplay is meaningfully and often almost entirely oriented around the player's interactions with a musical score or individual songs. Music video games may take a variety of forms and are often grouped with puzzle games due to their common use of \\"rhythmically generated puzzles\\".\\n\\n- Cordless Recordings is a netlabel owned by Warner Music Group. The label was founded in 2005 by Jac Holzman, who also founded Elektra Records and Nonesuch Records.\\n\\n- New wave is a genre of rock music popular from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with ties to 1970s punk rock. New wave moved away from smooth blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop music that incorporated electronic and experimental music, mod and disco. Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct, genre. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synthpop, college rock and gothic rock.\\n\\n- Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.\\n\\n- Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"\\n\\n- \`\` Brainpower '' is a song by the synthpop band Freezepop . It is the sixth track on the non limited edition of the band 's third album , Future Future Future Perfect , and seventh on the limited edition of the album . The song appears as a bonus track in the music video game Rock Band According to Liz Enthusiasm , the song is a true story , and is based on a time she became drunk and decided that \`\` Brainpower '' would be a good idea for a band name , only to then change her mind . According to Sean T. Drinkwater , there is allegedly an allegory in the song . The music video for the song was directed by Mega64 and posted on YouTube on March 4 , 2008 . In it , the band performs the song live on a low - budget cable show while a young viewer ( portrayed by Frank Howley ) uses a special remote to alter the reality of the performance on his TV .\\n\\n- Krautrock (sometimes called \\"kosmische Musik\\") is a broad genre of experimental rock that developed in Germany in the late 1960s. The term \\"krautrock\\" was originated by English-speaking music journalists as a humorous name for a diverse range of German bands whose music drew from sources such as psychedelic rock, avant-garde electronic music, funk, minimalism, jazz improvisation, and world music styles. Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and new-age music. Important acts of the scene include Can, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Faust.\\n\\n- Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.\\n\\n- Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.\\n\\n- Future Future Future Perfect is the third full-length studio album by Freezepop. It was released on September 25, 2007 by Cordless Recordings.\\n\\n- Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.\\n\\n- Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.\\n\\n- Freezepop is an American electronic band from Boston, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 by Liz Enthusiasm, Sean T. Drinkwater, and The Duke of Pannekoeken (an alias for Kasson Crooker). Since December 2009, the current lineup includes Enthusiasm, Drinkwater, Robert John \\"Bananas\\" Foster, and Christmas Disco-Marie Sagan. The band is named after the frozen snack, and they have described their music as \\"sweet and cold and fruity and plastic-y\\".\\n\\n- Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'brainpower ' has the relation 'record label' with?","target":"cordless recordings","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"cordless recordings\\""},{"source":"In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

The Garden Grove woman answered a series of questions to create and print a form to file with the court. \\"It's easy,\\" said Adams, 25. \\"I thought I'd have all kinds of questions and have to take the forms home.\\" A University of California, Irvine, study released Wednesday found an interactive computer system effectively helps people fill out paperwork for restraining orders, eviction defense, small-claims cases and requests for filing-fee waivers. Not only does the system make life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer, but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms, which are printed out when completed, are easy to read and are being filled out correctly, the study found. Since the program started in 2000, more than 6,000 people have used the free system, located in public buildings throughout Orange County. The system was developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County with about $800,000 in grants. The program avoids legal jargon, offers a courthouse video tour and sticks to a fifth-grade vocabulary. Users can choose English, Spanish or Vietnamese. Kiosks are in courthouses in Fullerton and Orange, the district attorney's family-support office, the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana, Irvine City Hall and the San Juan Capistrano Library. The program is also available online. Bob Cohen, executive director of Legal Aid, said the study should clear the way for expansion throughout California.

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form.\\n\\nA muscle strain (or pulled muscle) is an overstretched or torn muscle. Back strain is the most common cause of back pain, especially lower back pain. Muscle strain is often caused by overuse of a muscle or overloading a muscle. When a muscle is stressed beyond its limits, injury occurs. However, you risk a pull if you don’t warm up properly before you exercise and stretch a muscle past its limit, train longer than what your body can handle, or if you push a past muscle injury too far before the muscle has had adequate time to heal. You will know a muscle is pulled typically within 24 to 48 hours of the injury, as the area will become stiff, sore, you may experience loss of movement and muscle spasms, and bruising or swelling will often develop around the injured muscle. If you suffer a pulled muscle, here are ten ways to help speed the healing and soothe the pain and inflammation… 1. Ice. Icing a muscle strain as quickly as possible will do its part to reduce swelling and soothe pain. Ice applications can be administered in ice pack form or you can wrap ice cubes in a towel and cover the area frequently throughout the day for no more than 15-minutes each time. A grade-three injury is the most severe and also the least common type of strain injury. It refers to a complete tearing of a muscle or tendon, and it often occurs where the muscle is attached to the tendon above or below the joint. This kind of strain is accompanied by weakness, which means a person can no longer use that muscle. Cast immobilization and surgery are sometimes necessary. Due to the injury’s severity, recovery generally takes three to six months or longer. Back muscle strain is a common cause of lower back pain. Muscle strain can be caused by overuse of a muscle or overloading a muscle. A strain is a muscle or tendon injury; a sprain is a ligament injury. Relief from pain and inflammation from pulled back muscles / ligaments can be obtained by applying ice to the injury (wrap ice in cloth - do not apply ice directly to skin) for 15 to 20 minutes every 4 hours for two or three days. The cold helps reduce pain and inflammation and is also a distraction from the back pain. For a mild muscle strain, it takes around three to six weeks to recover with basic home care, according to an article by Healthline. Severe strains may take months to properly heal.... For a mild muscle strain, it takes around three to six weeks to recover with basic home care, according to an article by Healthline. Severe strains may take months to properly heal. Most people with a strained muscle usually experience full recovery with proper treatment, explains Pietrangelo. 10 Ways to Help Heal Pulled Muscles. A muscle pull (or strain) occurs when you twist, pull, or tear your muscle or tendon, the strong elastic cord that connects your muscle to the bone. As we age we are more susceptible to muscle pulls. The recovery time of muscle pull depends on the grade of muscle strain as described below: 1  Healing Time for Grade I Muscle Strain: This is minor condition, where only a small percentage of muscles are affected. This type of pulled muscle normalizes within a few weeks. Like back strain, back sprains may trigger back muscle spasms. Healing time depends on the severity of the sprain. Most back sprains heal in six to eight weeks but it can take several months for complete recovery from a severe back sprain. Ligaments take longer to heal than muscles. In most of the cases, how long will the muscle pull last depends on the location of the muscle and it also depends on the impact and severity of the injury. Under normal circumstances, symptoms of mild back muscle pull show improvement in about one to two weeks and show complete recovery in about 4 to 6 weeks. Moderate to mild pulled muscle in legs take about 8 to 10 weeks to heal completely. Symptoms of severe pulled muscle (usually grade III strain) persist until the tear in the muscle is surgically repaired. In some cases, the symptoms may persist even after the repair is done.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt.

There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans.

According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.\\n\\n- British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language.

It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts.\\n\\n- Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\\nRights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\".\\n\\n- The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. John Locke defined freedom under the rule of law as follows:\\n\\n- Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"\\n\\n- Human rights are moral principles or norms, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \\"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,\\" and which are \\"inherent in all human beings\\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.\\n\\n- A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\".

The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat).

We previously identified a fusion inhibitory peptide (HR2P-M2) targeting the MERS-CoV S2 protein HR1 domain and a highly potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody (m336) specific to the S1 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, m336 was found to have reduced efficacy against MERS-CoV strains with mutations in RBD, and HR2P-M2 showed low potency, thus limiting the clinical application of each when administered separately. However, we herein report that the combination of m336 and HR2P-M2 exhibited potent synergism in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with or without mutations in the RBD, resulting in the enhancement of antiviral activity in contrast to either one administered alone. Thus, this combinatorial strategy could be used in clinics for the urgent treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients. Viruses 2019, 11, 31 2 of 12 between viral and cellular membranes through the interaction between its HR1 and HR2 domains and entry of the viral genetic materials into the host cell [5] [6] [7] [8] . Thus, both the RBD in S1 subunit and HR1 domain in S2 subunit can serve as important targets for development of antiviral agents against MERS-CoV infection. Recently, we identified a peptide derived from the HR2 domain of MERS-CoV S protein S2 subunit, designated HR2P, which could interact with the HR1 domain of S protein S2 subunit to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) complex and block viral fusion and replication with IC 50 s ranging from 0.6 to 1 µM [5]. By replacing amino acid residues at the i to i + 4 positions with a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., E) and a positively charged amino acid (e.g., K) in HR2P for introduction of intramolecular salt-bridges, the resultant peptide HR2P-M2 exhibited improved solubility, stability, and anti-MERS-CoV activity [5, 9] . However, its potency is still not strong enough to warrant clinical development. By screening an extra-large phage-displayed antibody Fab library, Ying et al. identified a human neutralizing monoclonal antibody (hmAb), m336, which is specific for the RBD in the S protein S1 subunit. It exhibited highly potent neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection, both in vitro and in vivo [10] [11] [12] [13] . X-ray crystallography has shown that the binding epitope of m336 on MERS-CoV S protein almost completely overlaps with the binding site of DPP4 [14] . However, the future clinical application of m336 could be limited by its inability to neutralize MERS-CoV strains with mutations in RBD, like the mouse neutralizing mAb Mersmab1 with similar weakness [15, 16] . In this study, we compared the sensitivity of a pseudotyped MERS-CoV wild-type strain with that of strains with key mutations, including D509G, D510G, Q522H, and I529T, which were detected in the RBD of some MERS-CoV strains isolated from different regions and at different times throughout the course of the MERS outbreak from 2012 to 2015 [17, 18] . We found that these strains with mutations in RBD were significantly less sensitive than the wild-type strain to the neutralizing activity of m336, while the pseudoviruses with or without mutations showed equal sensitivity to the fusion inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2. Interestingly, when m336 was combined with HR2P-M2, a strong synergism emerged against MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in RBD, suggesting that this combinational therapy could be further developed for clinical use to treat patients infected by the MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in RBD. \\n Title: Combining a Fusion Inhibitory Peptide Targeting the MERS-CoV S2 Protein HR1 Domain and a Neutralizing Antibody Specific for the S1 Protein Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) Showed Potent Synergism against Pseudotyped MERS-CoV with or without Mutations in RBD","target":"False","rationale":"The title is too long and the words are not very specific, so it is not a good title for this research paper.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire.

At the point thetrains turned their freight, mail, and passengers over to steamboats, wagons, and stagecoaches. This meant that wagon freighting, stage coaching, and steam boating did not come to an end when the first train appeared; rather they became supplements or feeders. Each new \\"end of track\\" became a center for animal drawn or waterborne transportation. The major effect of the railroad was to shorten the distance that had to be covered by the older, slower, and more costly means. Wagon freighters continued operating throughout the 1870's and 1880's and into the 1890's. Although over constantly shrinking routes, and coaches and wagons continued to crisscross the West wherever the rails had not yet been laid. The beginning of a major change was foreshadowed in the later 1860's, when the Union Pacific Railroad at last began to build westward from the Central Plains city of Omaha to meet the Central Pacific Railroad advancing eastward from California through the formidable barrier of the Sierra Nevada. Although President Abraham Lincoln signed the original Pacific Railroad bill in 1862 and a revised, financially much more generous version in 1864, little construction was completed until 1865 on the Central Pacific and 1866 on the Union Pacific. The primary reason was skepticism that a Railroad built through so challenging and thinly settled a stretch of desert, mountain, and semiarid plain could pay a profit. In the words of an economist, this was a case of \\"premature enterprise\\", where not only the cost of construction but also the very high risk deterred private investment. In discussing the Pacific Railroad bill, the chair of the congressional committee bluntly stated that without government subsidy no one would undertake so unpromising a venture; yet it was a national necessity to link East and West together.\\nQuestion: The word \\"subsidy\\" in line 27 is closest in meaning to  _  .\\n- persuasion\\n- financing\\n- explanation\\n- penalty","target":"financing","rationale":"A subsidy is a financial benefit given by the government to individuals or organizations.

Habitat adaptation of fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra), as found in Middle Europe (Germany), can be framed in an explicit phylogeographic framework that allows for the evolution of habitat adaptation between distinct populations to be traced. Typically, females of S. salamandra only deposit their larvae in small permanent streams. However, some populations of the western post-glacial recolonization lineage use small temporary ponds as larval habitats. Pond larvae display several habitat-specific adaptations that are absent in stream-adapted larvae. We conducted mate preference tests with females from three distinct German populations in order to determine the influence of habitat adaptation versus neutral genetic distance on female mate choice. Two populations that we tested belong to the western post-glacial recolonization group, but are adapted to either stream or pond habitats. The third population is adapted to streams but represents the eastern recolonization lineage.', 'Despite large genetic distances with FST values around 0.5, the stream-adapted females preferred males from the same habitat type regardless of genetic distance.

The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after  Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were sold for as much as $500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956.

Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building.

While the Depression had several causes, one most relevant to Minnesota was that United States businesses in the 1920s had improved their efficiency through standardizing production methods and eliminating waste.  Business owners were reaping the benefits of this increase in productivity, but they were not sharing it with their employees because of the weakness of organized labor, nor were they sharing it with the public in the form of lowered prices.

The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound.\\n\\n- Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.\\n\\n- American English (variously abbreviated AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), also called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the \\"de facto\\" language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico. Under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory.\\n\\n- In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.\\n\\n- Agon (Classical Greek ) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece.\\n\\n- A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic.\\n\\n- Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.\\n\\n- Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.\\n\\n- Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912  January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.\\n\\n- Prop comedy is a comedy genre in which performers use humorous objects, or conventional objects in humorous ways. The stages and films term \\"prop\\", an abbreviation of \\"property\\", refers to any object an actor handles in the course of a performance. Though some form of prop comedy has likely existed as long as there have been comedians, the genre reached its zenith in the vaudeville era. The vaudeville team Olsen and Johnson used prop comedy extensively in their long running Broadway revue \\"Hellzapoppin\\".\\n\\n- Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") \\n\\n- Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.\\n\\n- Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.\\n\\n- Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.\\n\\n- Amusement is the state of experiencing humorous and entertaining events or situations while the person or animal actively maintains the experience, and is associated with enjoyment, happiness, laughter and pleasure.\\n\\n- Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek  (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from  (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\").\\n\\n- A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\\n\\n- A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means. Linguist Robert Hetzron offers the definition:\\n\\n- The desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people  or the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem  is called public opinion. \\nThe English term \\"public opinion\\" dates back to the seventeenth century work by John Locke, \\"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\\", which contains an early consideration of the importance of public opinion in the ordering of politics. The term was derived from the French word \\"l'opinion\\", which was first used in 1588 by Michel de Montaigne.\\n\\n- A comedian is one who entertains through comedy , such as jokes and other forms of humour . Following is a list of comedians , comedy groups , and comedy writers .\\n\\n- Humour (or humor in American English) is the tendency of particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (Latin: \\"humor\\", \\"body fluid\\"), controlled human health and emotion.\\n\\n- Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational.\\nVerbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.\\n\\n- Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\".\\n\\nParagraph: Ten reference genes were investigated for normalization of gene expression data in the shell gland of laying hens. Analyses performed with geNorm revealed that hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) were the two most stable reference genes in response to post-oviposition time alone (POT) or with nicarbazin treatment (POT+N) of laying hens. NormFinder analyses showed that the two most stable reference genes in response to POT and POT+N were 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and HMBS, RPL4, respectively. BestKeeper analyses showed that 18S rRNA, RPL4 and HPRT1, HMBS were the two most stable reference genes for POT, and POT+N, respectively. Of the ten reference genes, all except B2M showed geNorm M <0.5, suggesting that they were stably expressed in the shell gland tissue. Consensus from these three programs suggested HPRT1 and HMBS could be used as the two most stable reference genes in the present study. Expression analyses of four candidate target genes with the two most and the two least stable genes showed that a combination of stable reference genes leads to more discriminable quantification of expression levels of target genes, while the least stable genes failed to do so. Therefore, HMBS and HPRT1 are recommended as the two most stable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data at different stages of eggshell formation in brown-egg laying hens. Available statistical programs for reference gene ranking should include more robust analysis capability to analyse the gene expression data generated from factorial design experiments.

Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures.","target":"Coronary Disease","rationale":"The abstract discusses how right ventricular function relates to coronary artery disease, mitral and aortic valvular disease, congestive heart failure, systemic hypertension etc. However, the majority of the abstract is focused on coronary artery disease (CAD).

No history of facial or trigeminal pain had been obtained during life in these subjects. The technique of intravascular injection, which allowed good visualization and evaluation of the neurovascular relationships, is described. A total of 42 examples of contact with the root entry zone and 10 examples of compression were identified. In 30 of the examples of contact, the finding could be related to an artery; in the other examples, it appeared to be due to veins. Of the arterial compressions, the superior cerebellar artery was responsible in 53.8%, the anterior inferior cerebellar artery was responsible in 25.6%, and pontine branches of the basilar artery were responsible for the remaining 20.6%. Only one instance of unequivocal compression by a vein was found. Other anatomical observations of interest are reported. The absence of a history of trigeminal neuralgia in the 7% of examined nerves in which root entry zone showed arterial compression is in marked contrast to the finding of 80% or more in the operative series for trigeminal neuralgia.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it.

If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer.

It all started out 4 years ago when my Uncle who owns a couple of event planning companies asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get in to my own place. At first I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise. After being promoted I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally I and a few others had had enough. I complained to my Uncle and his best friend who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue. Finally I tried to quit several times but was quilted into staying on the job. Then over the course of one week I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me.

It follows that mechanisms that protect against HIV infection are likely operative at the genital mucosa. In HIV-resistant Kenyan sex workers who are highly exposed to HIV infection yet remain uninfected, protection correlates with HIV-specific immune responses and genetic factors. However, these factors do not entirely explain this model of natural immunity to HIV. We hypothesized that protection may be mediated by innate immune proteins in the genital tract of HIV-resistant sex workers.', 'The genital proteome of mucosal secretions from HIV-resistant women was examined using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Cervical lavage samples were collected from 315 HIV-resistant, HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected commercial sex workers.', 'Univariate analysis identified a 6 kDa biomarker of HIV resistance in genital secretions from these women. This protein was identified by tandem mass spectrometry as elafin and was found to be overexpressed in HIV-resistant women compared with HIV-uninfected (P = 0.001) and infected (P = 0.002) women.

It's insanely awkward to be given D but instructed to charge E, then to try to get the till to accept E as payment for X instead of C(X) whilst rendering D-E in change. And then all you're going to do is put D-C(X) in a little jar anyway. At best it takes a moment to figure out; at worst it ruins the end-of-day take calculations when a take of T is no longer equal to C(X)*N(X) across all items X. It could even throw off a stock check if executed sufficiently poorly by front-line staff. Even worse, bosses could start to suspect misconduct from staff fiddling the money they've been given by customers, and it would be difficult to prove your innocence from video-only surveillance. Just make your transaction like a normal person, paying D for X and getting D-C(X) as change in return then say \\"here, keep this; I have enough shrapnel as it is!\\", make an audible awkward chuckle, smile, and walk away.","target":"no","rationale":"The answer suggests a variety of options, which is not an acceptable answer."},{"source":"Two analogies that relate places/locations to the associated travel mode is given in the form \\"A : B.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.\\nFrom the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.\\n\\n- The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.\\n\\n- The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.\\n\\n- Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces, police, intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex.\\n\\n- A field officer, field grade officer, or senior officer is an army, marine, or air force commissioned officer senior in rank to a company officer but junior to a general officer. In most armies this corresponds to the ranks of major, lieutenant colonel and colonel, or their equivalents. Some countries also include brigadier in the definition.\\n\\n- The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.\\n\\n- The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large.\\n\\n- Major is a military rank of commissioned officer status, with corresponding ranks existing in many military forces throughout the world. When used unhyphenated, in conjunction with no other indicators, Major is one rank senior to that of an army Captain, and one rank subordinate or below the rank of Lieutenant colonel. It is considered the most junior of the field officer ranks.\\n\\n- Thomas Buchanan McGuire , Jr. ( August 1 , 1920 -- January 7 , 1945 ) was a United States Army major who was killed in action while serving as a member of the Army Air Forces during World War II and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . He was one of the most decorated American fighter pilots and the second highest scoring American ace of the war . McGuire was memorialized by the renaming of Fort Dix Army Air Force Base in Burlington County , New Jersey , to McGuire Air Force Base in 1948 .\\n\\n- The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790.\\n\\n- An army (from Latin \\"arma\\" \\"arms, weapons\\" via Old French \\"armée\\", \\"armed\\" (feminine)) or ground force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include other branches of the military such as the air force via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. They differ from army reserves who are activated only during such times as war or natural disasters.\\n\\n- The Army of the United States or Armies of the United States is the legal name of the \\"land forces of the United States\\" (United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001) and has been used in this context since at least 1841, as in the title: \\"General Regulations for the Army of the United States\\". The Army, or Armies of the United States includes: the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve, (as well as any volunteer or conscripted forces). \\n\\n- The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.\\n\\n- A fighter pilot is a military aviator trained to engage in air-to-air combat while in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft. Fighter pilots undergo specialized training in aerial warfare and dogfighting (close range aerial combat). A fighter pilot with at least five air-to-air kills becomes known as an ace.\\n\\n- The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'thomas mcguire' exhibits the relationship of 'occupation'.

Anyone can start a blog, and they can write about anything they like. There are millions of blogs on the Internet today. They provide news, information,advertisements, advice and ideas for many people who read them. They contain links to other Web sites. And they provide a place for people to write about their ideas and react to the ideas of others.\\nA research company called Perscus has studied more than 300 Web logs. It says that blogs are most popular with teenage girls. They use them to let their friends know what is happening in their lives. The study also says that more than 100,000 bloggers stopped taking part in the activity after a year.\\nHowever, some people develop serious blogs to present political and other ideas. For example, the Republican and Democratic parties in the southern state of Kentucky recently started their own blogs. And American companies are beginning to use blogs to advertise their products. At the same time, some long-standing blogs have ended. Last week, blogging leader Dave Winer closed his free blog service \\"weblogs. com\\". He says the site became too costly to continue. He started the blog four years ago. And thousands of people had written on it. They are now upset because they did not know that the site was closing. One blog that is still going strong is called Rebecca's Pocket. Rebecca Blood created the Web-site in 1999. She wrote about the history of blogs on the site.

Newer nonionic contrast agents have been shown to have fewer adverse hemodynamic, inotropic, and rheologic effects compared with ionic media and it has been suggested that they might not substantially affect coronary blood flow. Six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. Intracoronary injections of iohexol (300 mg/ml iodine) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function. Two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml/sec; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml/sec. The 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31% (p less than .01) and 77% (p less than .001). The 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml/sec 77% (p less than .001) and 69% (p less than .001). The magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose, and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection. Decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19% to 29%. The effects on regional myocardial function were independent of contrast volume.

Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body of still water. In this case, a delta forms. A delta is shaped like a triangle. It spreads out into the body of water. \\n\\nQuestion: Are larger sediments dropped in steeper or less steep areas than smaller sediments in the same stream?\\nI found this answer \\"Steeper\\".

Excavated inscriptions record titles such as Mahapradhana (Chief minister), Sandhivigrahika, and Dharmadhikari (chief justice). Some positions such as Tadeyadandanayaka (commander of reserve army) were specialised in function while all ministerial positions included the role of Dandanayaka (commander), showing that cabinet members were trained as army commanders as well as in general administrative skills.The kingdom was divided into provinces such as Banavasi-12000, Nolambavadi-32000, Gangavadi-96000, each name including the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in Belavola-300. The big provinces were called Mandala and under them were Nadu further divided into Kampanas (groups of villages) and finally a Bada (village). A Mandala was under a member of the royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. Tailapa II himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the Rashtrakuta rule. Chiefs of Mandalas were transferable based on political developments. For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Someshvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000. Women from the royal family also administered Nadus and Kampanas.

He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. He is considered by some as one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time. More recently an aviation entrepreneur, he has founded and run two airlines (Lauda Air and Niki).\\n\\nAfter an unsuccessful start to the 1970s culminating in a disastrous start to the 1973 season, Ferrari regrouped completely under Luca di Montezemolo and were resurgent in 1974. The team's faith in the little-known Lauda was quickly rewarded by a second-place finish in his debut race for the team, the season-opening Argentine Grand Prix. His first Grand Prix (GP) victory - and the first for Ferrari since 1972 - followed only three races later in the Spanish Grand Prix. Although Lauda became the season's pacesetter, achieving six consecutive pole positions, a mixture of inexperience and mechanical unreliability meant Lauda won only one more race that year, the Dutch GP. He finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship and demonstrated immense commitment to testing and improving the car.  The 1975 F1 season started slowly for Lauda; after no better than a fifth-place finish in the first four races, he won four of the next five driving the new Ferrari 312T. His first World Championship was confirmed with a third-place finish at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza; Lauda's teammate Regazzoni won the race and Ferrari clinched their first Constructors' Championship in 11 years; Lauda then picked up a fifth win at the last race of the year, the United States GP at Watkins Glen. He also became the first driver to lap the Nurburgring Nordschleife in under seven minutes, which was considered a huge feat as the Nordschleife section of the Nurburgring was two miles longer than it is today. Lauda famously gave away any trophies he won to his local garage in exchange for his car to be washed and serviced.  Unlike 1975 and despite tensions between Lauda and Montezemolo's successor, Daniele Audetto, Lauda dominated the start of the 1976 F1 season, winning four of the first six races and finishing second in the other two. By the time of his fifth win of the year at the British GP, he had more than double the points of his closest challengers Jody Scheckter and James Hunt, and a second consecutive World Championship appeared a formality. It would be a feat not achieved since Jack Brabham's victories in 1959 and 1960. He also looked set to win the most races in a season, a record held by the late Jim Clark since 1963.

However, starting from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could become a Polish–Lithuanian monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents—the Pacta conventa (\\"agreed pacts\\")—a confirmation of the king's pre-election promises, and Henrican articles (artykuły henrykowskie, named after the first freely elected king, Henry of Valois). The latter document served as a virtual Polish constitution and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:","target":"royal family","rationale":"The question is asking who was eligible to become a Polish-Lithuanian monarch in 1500.

However, starting from 1573 anyone related to royalty could take on this role if they were chosen by the Sejm (the lower house of parliament).

The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August.
