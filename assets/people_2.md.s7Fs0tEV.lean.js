Experiments with an honesty box to collect payments for hot drinks show that people are better at paying up when under the gaze  of a pair of eyes. The surprise was that the eyes were not real, but photographed.\\nResearchers at Newcastle University set up the experiment in secret. They attached a poster to a cupboard of mugs above an-honesty box alongside a kettle ,with tea, coffee and milk. Over 10 weeks, they alternated each week between images of eyes and pictures of flowers.\\nDr. Bateson, a behavioral biologist and leader of the study, said that even though the eyes were not real they still seemed to make people behave more honestly. They effect may arise from behavioral characteristics that developed as early humans formed social groups that increased their chances of survival. Individuals had to co-operate for the good of the group, rather than act selfishly.\\n\\"If nobody is watching us, it is in our interests to behave selfishly.

The name \\"Pinhead\\" is derived from a sobriquet given to him by the crew of the first Hellraiser film; he is first credited as such in Hellbound: Hellraiser II. Nearly thirty years after The Hellbound Heart was published, the character was given the designations the Hell Priest and the Cold Man in the sequels that followed, The Scarlet Gospels and Hellraiser: The Toll. Pinhead is one of the leaders of the Cenobites, formerly humans but transformed into creatures which reside in an extradimensional realm, who travel to Earth through a puzzle box called the Lament Configuration in order to harvest human souls.\\n\\nDescribed by Doug Bradley as stronger than Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Pinhead is an extremely powerful being, and as such, has several supernatural abilities. His preferred method of attack is by summoning hooks and chains to mutilate victims, often pulling said victims in several directions to tear them apart. These chains are subject to his total mental control and he may direct them at will. The chains may even change shape after having attached to a victim. Pinhead is highly resistant to damage and direct assault, being able to resist both gunshots and futuristic energy weapons. His magic is also used for creating objects out of thin air, teleporting, creating explosions at distances and deceiving opponents with illusions. He is capable of creating other cenobites from both living and dead victims.  In order to act in the physical world, Pinhead needs to have been purposely summoned through the Lament Configuration, though this in itself is not usually enough for Pinhead to target the puzzle-solver: in Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Pinhead stops the Cenobites from torturing an emotionally traumatised girl who was manipulated as a proxy into opening the Configuration, remarking \\"...it is not hands that call us, it is desire.\\" In Hell on Earth, he temporarily eliminates these restraints when he is separated from the part of him that is Elliot Spencer, wreaking havoc indiscriminately upon every human subject he encounters until he is finally defeated when Spencer willingly merges with Pinhead once again, the combination binding Pinhead as Spencer keeps his extremes in check. During this incident his powers were apparently expanded beyond their normal limits allowing him to physically warp reality to his will.  Pinhead at first has no memory of his human past, though is reminded of it in Hellbound: Hellraiser II, which results in what screenwriter Peter Atkins described as him being \\"spiritually weakened\\" and subsequently killed by the Chanard Cenobite.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was Pinhead's weaknesses?","target":"eliminates these restraints when he is separated from the part of him that is Elliot Spencer, wreaking havoc indiscriminately upon every human subject he encounters","rationale":"The context says \\"Pinhead\\" was a former human who became transformed into a cenobite.

Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias.\\n\\nFrom 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.  After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year.  Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio.

However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5]\\n\\nRural development is a comprehensive term.

These include Eyrie, created for Adelaide's Hyatt Hotel in 1993, and Magnolia and Palm, commissioned in 1999 by the Sydney Botanical Gardens, as part of the Sydney Sculpture Walk. That same year, Big Feathers was commissioned for the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane. It comprises two large feather-shaped forms suspended above the pedestrian precinct, representing \\"Queen Street's history of parades as well as the mall's connection between earth and sky\\".In 2000, Oliver's piece Entwine was a finalist in the inaugural Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award, while in the following year, Oliver won the University of New South Wales inaugural sculpture commission competition, with her three-metre-high Globe. Other success followed, when Trace was selected for the National Gallery of Australia's 2002 National Sculpture Prize exhibition.In August 2002 she was one of five artists shortlisted by the Australian Government for a project to produce a public artwork celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia.By the 2000s most of Oliver's output constituted commissioned pieces, whether public or private. The most substantial of these is Vine, a 16.5 metre high sculpture installed as part of the $400 million refurbishment of the Sydney Hilton. Taking twelve months to create and requiring a budget of up to half million dollars, the work was completed in 2005.

If you lose the case, you will have the ticket on your record. It may be worth while to look into fighting the ticket or pleading guilty with an explanation, in which case you may see a reduction in fine. In conclusion: Speeding tickets may affect the cost of your car insurance. Insurers may check driving records, and they may consider drivers with speeding tickets a greater insurance risk. That can increase premiums for drivers even if they haven't made a claim. So even if the violation appears on your driving record, it won't impact your total points. For example, Ohio doesn't add a point to your driving record after you're convicted of speeding less than 5 mph above the posted limit. Even if a violation adds zero points, it can still be included in your driving record. Some common examples of minor moving violations: 1  Seat belt violations. 2  Improper turns. 3  Disobeying traffic lights and signals. 4  Speeding tickets (when the speed was not significantly higher than the posted limit) 5  Illegal U-turns. Tickets normally can stay on a Virginia driving record from three years to 11 years, however if you are convicted of a serious violation it will remain on your MVR permanently. So the length of time that a conviction stays on your VA driving record depends on the severity of the violation. Posted on March 25, 2012January 27, 2012 by. A traffic violation will undoubtedly negatively affect your driving record, but it doesn’t mean that you will be blacklisted by insurance companies for your entire life just for a speeding ticket you received when you were sixteen. Thus, a speeding ticket for going 10 miles over the speed limit will affect a 17-year-old much more than it will an established driver with a clean record who’s 60. Note that traffic violation tickets will typically stay on your record for three years from the date that you’re convicted, and not from the date that you received the ticket. Major Tickets. Major tickets are those that include high-speed driving tickets, such as 50 miles or more over the limit, or driving without insurance. One major ticket can cause a significant increase in your insurance premium, usually for the next two to five years. How to Get a Copy of Your Driving Record. 1  Check for online access.

Juliette can kill people with the simplest of touches and because of that it has been almost a year since she had touched anything. Alone and scared Juliette&#8217;s world turns upside down when she is suddenly sharing a cell, and not just anyone, with a boy that may or may not be from her past. When things become even more complicated and Juliette finds out exactly why she has been locked up she must decide who to trust and just what she is willing to do to save her life and those around her.God did I love Juliette.

The official records of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq's invasion in Odisha (1360-1361 CE), for example, describe the destruction of the Jagannath temple as well as numerous other temples, defacing of dancing statues, and ruining of dance halls. This led to a broad decline in Odissi and other religious arts, but there were some benevolent rulers in this period who supported arts particularly through performances at courts. During the Sultanate and Mughal era of India, the temple dancers were moved to entertain the Sultan's family and courts. They became associated with concubinage to the nobility.  The Odissi dance likely expanded in the 17th century, states Alexandra Carter, under King Ramachandradeva's patronage. This expansion integrated martial arts (akhanda) and athletics into Odissi dance, by engaging boys and youth called Gotipuas, as a means to physically train the young for the military and to resist foreign invasions. According to Ragini Devi, historical evidence suggests that the Gotipuas tradition was known and nurtured in the 14th century, by Raja of Khurda.  During the British Raj, the officials of the colonial government ridiculed the temple traditions, while Christian missionaries launched a sustained attack on the moral outrage of sensuousness of Odissi and other Hindu temple dance arts. In 1872, a British civil servant named William Hunter watched a performance at the Jagannath temple in Puri, then wrote, \\"Indecent ceremonies disgraced the ritual, and dancing girls with rolling eyes put the modest worshipper to the blush...\\", and then attacked them as idol-worshipping prostitutes who expressed their devotion with \\"airy gyrations\\".  Christian missionaries launched the \\"anti-dance movement\\" in 1892, to ban all such dance forms. The dancers were dehumanized and stigmatized as prostitutes during the British period. In 1910, the British colonial government in India banned temple dancing, and the dance artists were reduced to abject poverty from the lack of any financial support for performance arts, combined with stereotyping stigma.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Was there any ultimate purpose for the males to learn the dance?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"a means to physically train the young for the military and to resist foreign invasions.","rationale":"It is mentioned in the context that males were engaged to learn dance.

The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources.

His family moved to Tuakau, south of Auckland, in 1920, after his father, who served at Gallipoli with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, was allocated land there. His grandparents had emigrated from Yorkshire to northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century.\\nContext: Hillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960-1961, and 1963-1965. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.  In 1960 Hillary organized an expedition to search for the fabled abominable snowman. Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten. No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope. Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\".  In 1962 he was a guest on the television game show What's My Line?; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin. In 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source. From 1977 to 1979 he commentated aboard Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand. In 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest. This accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as Three Poles Challenge. In January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica as part of a delegation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base.\\nQuestion: What other places did he go?.

Bermuda was settled and claimed by England as a result of the 1609 shipwreck there of the Virginia Company's flagship, and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed Somers Isles Company. The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the crown, thereby founding the Colony of Virginia. The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful. In 1620, Plymouth was founded as a haven for puritan religious separatists, later known as the Pilgrims. Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous trans-Atlantic voyage: Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics (1634), Rhode Island (1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut (1639) for Congregationalists. The Province of Carolina was founded in 1663. With the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in exchange for Suriname. In 1681, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn.

Notable exceptions were found with the ciliary anlage of the embryonic retina and the choroid plexus/leptomeninges, where transcripts from the IGF2 but not the H19 locus could be detected. Moreover, in contrast to the other tissue samples examined, the choroid plexus/leptomeninges expressed both parental IGF2 alleles. Whilst RNase protection analysis revealed a weak activity of the P1 promoter in the choroid plexus/leptomeninges, the P2, P3 and P4 promoters were all active wherever IGF2 was expressed.

For example, while a monopoly \`\`has'' an MC curve it does not have a supply curve. In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller's willing and able to supply at each price -- for each price, there is a unique quantity that would be supplied. The one-to-one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly. With a monopoly, there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity.

The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by King George V and Queen Mary at the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911 at Kingsway Camp on 15 December 1911, during their imperial visit. Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens (Sir Edwin from 1918), who first visited Delhi in 1912, and Herbert Baker (Sir Herbert from 1926), both leading 20th-century British architects. The contract was given to Sobha Singh (later Sir Sobha Singh). Construction really began after World War I and was completed by 1931.

The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.

In 1373, at an specially arranged meeting in Pirna, an imperial mediation attempt took place. Since Magnus did not appear, however, the Imperial Ban against him was renewed and fighting continued. In 1373, Duke Magnus was killed in a battle at Leveste on the Deister on 25 July 1373.

In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. \\n\\n- A diminutive is a word which has been modified to convey a slighter degree of its root meaning, to convey the smallness of the object or quality named, or to convey a sense of intimacy or endearment. A (abbreviated ) is a word-formation device used to express such meanings; in many languages, such forms can be translated as \\"little\\" and diminutives can also be formed as multi-word constructions such as \\"Tiny Tim\\". Diminutives are used frequently when speaking to small children or when expressing extreme tenderness and intimacy to an adult. As such, they are often employed for nicknames and pet names. The opposite of the diminutive form is the augmentative.\\n\\n- Julien Louis Geoffroy (17 August 1743  27 February 1814) was a French literary critic.\\n\\n- Condé Nast (stylized as CONDÉ NAST) is an American mass media company founded in 1909 by Condé Montrose Nast, based at One World Trade Center and owned by Advance Publications.

Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.\\n\\n- A cartoon is a type of two-dimensional illustration. While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to (a) a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic artistic style of drawing or painting, (b) an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor, or (c) a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. An artist who creates cartoons is called a cartoonist.\\n\\n- Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.\\n\\n- Oral literature or folk literature corresponds in the sphere of the spoken (oral) word to literature as literature operates in the domain of the written word. \\n\\n- Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). \\nThe two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.\\n\\n- In linguistics, a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \\"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\\"), or several (\\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are \\"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\\").\\nA complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (\\"rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed\\"), or more than one root in a compound (\\"black-board, rat-race\\"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (\\"a red rock\\"), clauses (\\"I threw a rock\\"), and sentences (\\"He threw a rock too, but he missed\\").\\n\\n- The French Revolution was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.\\n\\n- A critic is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.\\n\\n- Feuilleton ( French pronunciation :  ( fœjt ) ; a diminutive of French : feuillet , the leaf of a book ) was originally a kind of supplement attached to the political portion of French newspapers , consisting chiefly of non-political news and gossip , literature and art criticism , a chronicle of the latest fashions , and epigrams , charades and other literary trifles . The term feuilleton was invented by Julien Louis Geoffroy and Bertin the Elder , editors of the French Journal des débats in 1800 . The feuilleton may be described as a \`\` talk of the town '' , and a contemporary English - language example of the form is the \`\` Talk of the Town '' section of The New Yorker . In English newspapers , the term \`\` feuilleton '' instead came to refer to an installment of a serial story printed in one part of a newspaper . The genre of the feuilleton in its French sense was eventually included in English newspapers , but was not referred to as a feuilleton . In contemporary French , feuilleton has taken on the meaning \`\` soap opera '' . German and Polish newspapers still use the term for their literary and arts sections .\\n\\n- The Journal des débats (French for: Journal of Debates) was a French newspaper, published between 1789 and 1944 that changed title several times. Created shortly after the first meeting of the Estates-General of 1789, it was, after the outbreak of the French Revolution, the exact record of the debates of the National Assembly, under the title \\"Journal des Débats et des Décrets\\" (\\"Journal of Debates and Decrees\\").\\n\\n- Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\\n\\n- Art criticism is the discussion or evaluation of visual art. Art critics usually criticise art in the context of aesthetics or the theory of beauty. A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.\\n\\n- The New Yorker is an American magazine of reportage, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. It is published by Condé Nast. Started as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans.\\n\\n- Aesthetics (also spelled æsthetics and esthetics also known in Greek as , or \\"\\"Aisthtiké\\"\\") is a branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of art, beauty, and taste, with the creation and appreciation of beauty. It is more scientifically defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgements of sentiment and taste. More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as \\"critical reflection on art, culture and nature\\". In modern English, the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the Cubist aesthetic.\\n\\n- Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.\\n\\n- A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.\\n\\n- Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") \\n\\n- A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.\\n\\n- A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. \\n\\n- An art critic is a person who is specialized in analyzing, interpreting and evaluating art. Their written critiques or reviews contribute to art criticism and they are published in newspapers, magazines, books, exhibition brochures and catalogues and on web sites. Some of today's art critics use art blogs and other online platforms in order to connect with a wider audience and expand debate about art.\\n\\n- The Estates-General (or States-General) of 1789 was the first meeting since 1614 of the French Estates-General, a general assembly representing the French estates of the realm: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate). Summoned by King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his government's financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse over the first item on the agenda: whether they should vote by estate, giving the first two estates an advantage, which was the King's choice, or vote all together, giving the Third Estate the advantage. It was brought to an end when the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, inviting the other two to join, against the wishes of the King. This signals the outbreak of the French Revolution.\\n\\n- Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'genre' with the subject 'feuilleton'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- action\\n - adult\\n - art\\n - cartoon\\n - communication\\n - criticism\\n - culture\\n - drama\\n - dramatic\\n - entertainment\\n - fashion\\n - fiction\\n - genre\\n - golf\\n - government\\n - health\\n - history\\n - image\\n - information\\n - journalism\\n - letter\\n - linguistics\\n - literary fiction\\n - literature\\n - magazine\\n - mass\\n - music\\n - narrative\\n - nature\\n - news\\n - novel\\n - novella\\n - philosophy\\n - play\\n - poetry\\n - prose\\n - rock\\n - satire\\n - serial\\n - short story\\n - society\\n - study\\n - symbolism\\n - television\\n - universe\\n - variety\\n - various\\n - video\\n - western\\n - will","target":"satire","rationale":"The feuilleton was originally a form of satire or critique, so it is most closely related to literary fiction.\\n\`;"},{"source":"In this task, you need to count the number of words in a sentence that end with the given letter.

There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase.

However, patients still have to pay a substantial proportion of their annual income for treatment of this disease. This study describes the economic burden on patients with tuberculosis; identifies related factors by comparing two areas with different management models; and provides policy recommendation for tuberculosis control reform in China. There are three tuberculosis management models in China: the tuberculosis dispensary model, specialist model and integrated model. We selected Zhangjiagang (ZJG) and Taixing (TX) as the study sites, which correspond to areas implementing the integrated model and dispensary model, respectively. Patients diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis since January 2010 were recruited as study subjects. A total of 590 patients (316 patients from ZJG and 274 patients from TX) were interviewed with a response rate of 81%. The economic burden attributed to tuberculosis, including direct costs and indirect costs, was estimated and compared between the two study sites. The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to compare the cost differences between the two groups. Potential factors related to the total outof-pocket costs were analyzed based on a step-by-step multivariate linear regression model after the logarithmic transformation of the costs. The average (median, interquartile range) total cost was 18793.33 (9965, 3200-24400) CNY for patients in ZJG, which was significantly higher than for patients in TX (mean: 6598.33, median: 2263, interquartile range: 983-6688) (Z = 10.42, P < 0.001). After excluding expenses covered by health insurance, the average out-of-pocket costs were 14304.4 PLOS ONE | Education Institutions (PAPD). The funders had no CNY in ZJG and 5639.2 CNY in TX.

Under the current \\"free of diagnosis and treatment\\" policy, the financial burden remains heavy on tuberculosis patients.

The main drawbacks in their development and use have been reliance on an unpredictable method of attenuation and the potential for evolutionary reversion to high virulence. Methods of genetic engineering now provide many safer alternatives to live vaccines, so if live vaccines are to compete with these alternatives in the future, they must either have superior immunogenicity or they must be able to overcome these former disadvantages. Several live vaccine designs that were historically inaccessible are now feasible because of advances in genome synthesis. Some of those methods are addressed here, with an emphasis on whether they enable predictable levels of attenuation and whether they are stable against evolutionary reversion. These new designs overcome many of the former drawbacks and position live vaccines to be competitive with alternatives.

Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats.

For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursynów).

Both the theory and the ideal gas law predict that gases compressed to very high pressures and cooled to very low temperatures should still behave like gases, albeit cold, dense ones. As gases are compressed and cooled, however, they invariably condense to form liquids, although very low temperatures are needed to liquefy light elements such as helium (for He, 4.2 K at 1 atm pressure). Liquefaction can be viewed as an extreme deviation from ideal gas behavior. It occurs when the molecules of a gas are cooled to the point where they no longer possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome intermolecular attractive forces. The precise combination of temperature and pressure needed to liquefy a gas depends strongly on its molar mass and structure, with heavier and more complex molecules usually liquefying at higher temperatures. In general, substances with large van der Waals acoefficients are relatively easy to liquefy because large a coefficients indicate relatively strong intermolecular attractive interactions. Conversely, small molecules with only light elements have small a coefficients, indicating weak intermolecular interactions, and they are relatively difficult to liquefy. Gas liquefaction is used on a massive scale to separate O2, N2, Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe. After a sample of air is liquefied, the mixture is.\\n\\n\\nQ: Liquefaction ccurs when the molecules of a gas are cooled to the point where they no longer possess sufficient kinetic energy to overcome what?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"intermolecular attractive forces","rationale":"The answer is intermolecular attractive forces."},{"source":"Fill in the response.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\\n\\nA situation that comes to mind as one that was striking and memorable happened around 2 weeks ago.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis.

A detailed description of Las Meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (\\"the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age\\") in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the  records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue.

They initially signed to Tracklacers production company New Track City and then went on to become runners-up of the fifth series of the ITV reality talent show The X Factor in 2008, coming second to Alexandra Burke. Following their appearance on The X Factor, JLS signed to Epic Records. Their first two singles \\"Beat Again\\" and \\"Everybody in Love\\" both went to number one on the UK Singles Chart.\\n\\nAs well as appearing on numerous TV programmes for promotion of their albums/singles, JLS have had two special TV shows of their own broadcast. The first was an hour-long documentary for ITV2, titled JLS Revealed, which first aired on 7 November 2009. The documentary followed them in the year after they had finished second in The X Factor, capturing them as they toured with Lemar, released their singles and attended the MOBO Awards amongst other highlights. The second show was an hour-long entertainment show for ITV titled This Is JLS, which first aired on 11 December 2010 before the first show of that year's X Factor final. Filmed before a live studio audience, the band performed all of their hits, tracks from the Outta This World album and a special duet with Kylie Minogue on her hit song \\"All the Lovers\\", as well as partaking in surprise hidden camera stunts for lucky fans who had been invited to be in the audience for the show.  The group have also released their own documentary film titled JLS: Eyes Wide Open 3D, making them the first British music act to release a 3D film. Filmed at The O2 Arena during the tour for their second album Outta This World in December 2010/January 2011, and incorporated with documentary footage shot by Ben Winston and Andy Morahan, it was shown exclusively for three days only from 3 June 2011 in over 300 UK cinemas. Due to many cinemas selling out tickets for the initial weekend, additional screenings were made in cinemas for the following weekend from 10 June 2011, thus, more tickets were available to buy online or on the day of screening. It opened at number 5 in the UK Box Office chart, raking in PS463,914 from three June weekend screenings alone. A DVD of the film was released on 5 December 2011.

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end.

Homeward bound, she died at Dresden on 19 April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died \\"gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet drew my attention to her.\\" After placing Žofie with Kateřina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, by Liszt's pupil Peter Cornelius. This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, and fell in love with Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiová, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10 July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.Meanwhile, the defeat of Franz Joseph's army at Solferino in 1859 had weakened the Habsburg Empire, and led to the fall from power of von Bach. This had gradually brought a more enlightened atmosphere to Prague, and by 1861 Smetana was seeing prospects of a better future for Czech nationalism and culture. Before deciding his own future, in September Smetana set out on a concert tour of the Netherlands and Germany. He was still hoping to secure a reputation as a pianist, but once again he experienced failure. Back in Prague, he conducted performances of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp in the Žofín Island concert hall in January 1862, to a muted reception. Critics accused him of adhering too closely to the \\"New German\\" school represented primarily by Liszt; Smetana responded that \\"a prophet is without honour in his own land.\\" In March 1862 he made a last brief visit to Gothenburg, but the city no longer held his interest; it appeared to...","target":"Smetana","rationale":"As we can see, the passage is talking about Smetana.

Many politicians, including the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are of the view that a political party's performance in Istanbul is more significant than its general performance overall. This is due to the city's role as Turkey's financial centre, its large electorate and the fact that Erdoğan himself was elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. In the run-up to local elections in 2019, Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.Historically, Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general election, with 41.74% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election on 24 June 2018. Erdoğan, the AKP's presidential candidate, received exactly 50.0% of the vote in the presidential election held on the same day. Starting with Erdoğan in 1994, Istanbul has had a conservative mayor for 25 years, until 2019. The second largest party in Istanbul is the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also the country's main opposition. The left-wing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is the city's third largest political force due to a substantial number of Kurdish people migrating from south-eastern Turkey.\\nMore recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the 2014 mayoral election where the centre-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the 2017 constitutional referendum, where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country....\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the first name of the person who lost the vote in 2019 with 48.61%?","target":"Binali","rationale":"The first question in the context is about political issues and elections.\\nIt states that for 25 years, Istanbul voted for a conservative mayor until 2019.

David has to find out which tips are most useful for him.\\n\\nHint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles.

Following elections in 2006 and the subsequent Gaza conflict between the Fatah and Hamas parties, its authority had extended only in areas A and B of the West Bank. Since January 2013, the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority uses the name \\"State of Palestine\\" on official documents.\\n\\n- The West Bank (\\"\\" \\"HaGadah HaMa'aravit\\") is a landlocked territory near the Mediterranean coast of Western Asia, forming the bulk of the Palestinian territories. The West Bank shares boundaries (demarcated by the Jordanian-Israeli armistice of 1949) to the west, north, and south with Israel, and to the east, across the Jordan River, with Jordan. The West Bank also contains a significant section of the western Dead Sea shore.\\n\\n- The Palestinian Authority Government of November 2003 was a government of the Palestinian National Authority ( PA ) from November 2003 to February 2005 . It was headed by Ahmed Qurei , the Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority . The new 24 - member was approved by Parliament on 12 November with 46 votes to 13 , with 5 abstentions .\\n\\n- Hamas (', an acronym of ' Islamic Resistance Movement) is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist organization. It has a social service wing, Dawah, and a military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and, since 2007, has been the governing authority of the Gaza Strip.\\n\\n- The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'palestinian authority government of november 2003' and '2006'?","target":"end time","rationale":"The rationale to choose the answer could be: \\"end time\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you need to count the number of words in a sentence that start with the given letter.

Following Ancheta's guilty plea, Klausner sentenced Ancheta to 57 months in prison for various botnet-related crimes. In 2016, Klausner presided over a copyright case filed by the estate of Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe against Led Zeppelin founders Robert Plant and Jimmy Page. The estate of Wolfe alleged that Wolfe was entitled to a writing credit for the song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"; Klausner ruled in April 2016 that a jury could find \\"substantial similarity\\" between the elements of the two songs. In another copyright case arising from the Star Trek fan film Prelude to Axanar, Klausner rejected various motions by both parties in January 2017, setting the stage for a civil trial on the matter to go forward.

In amniotes that lay eggs, the shell of the egg provides protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The albumin, or egg white, provides the embryo with water and protein, whereas the fattier egg yolk is the energy supply for the embryo, as is the case with the eggs of many other animals, such as amphibians. However, the eggs of amniotes contain three additional extra-embryonic membranes: the chorion, amnion, and allantois (Figure 29.20). Extra-embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo. While the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself, the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac. The chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the egg’s external environment. The amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration. The allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration.

The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened.

In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor.

According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting.

By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere\\nSo Daniel's car would create less pollution"},{"source":"We would like you to classify each of the following sets of argument pairs (discussing Death Penalty)  into either SIMILAR or NOT SIMILAR.

A macroscopic spatial analysis of HCV infection that can provide scientific information for further intervention and disease control is lacking. Methods: All geo-referenced HCV cases that had been recorded by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) during 2005-2011 were included in the study. In order to learn about the changes of demographic characteristics and geographic distribution, trend test and spatial analysis were conducted to reflect the changing pattern of HCV infection. Results: Over 770,000 identified HCV infection cases had specific geographic information during the study period (2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011). Ratios of gender (Male/Female, Z-value = 218.53, P,0.001), age group (#30 years old/$31 years old, Z-value = 2 51.03, P,0.001) and diagnosis type (Clinical diagnosis/Laboratory diagnosis, Z-value = 2130.47, P,0.001) declined. HCV infection was not distributed randomly. Provinces Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Jilin reported more than 40,000 HCV infections during 2005 to 2011, accounting for 43.91% of all cases. The strength of cluster of disease was increasing in China during the study period. Overall, 11 provinces had once been detected as hotspots during 7 years, most of which were located in the central or border parts of China. Tibet, Qinghai, Jiangxi were the regions that had coldspots. The number of clustering of HCV infection among older adults increased in recent years.

Known as Emesa at the start of the first century AD, the city was at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire, and ruled by the Emesene dynasty, a client kingdom of the Romans. Nearly 2,000 years later, the looters—digging near the former site of a monument to Sampsiceramus—found a complex of rich tombs, and removed the grave goods. Their looting was uncovered because small golden plaques, adorning the burial shroud of the body in tomb 11, flaked off when disturbed. The next morning, children noticed these gold flakes mixed in with the earth and brought them to a bazaar, where it came to the attention of the police; it ultimately led to the arrest of the looters, and the confiscation of the grave objects. The objects, including the helmet, were then secured for the state collection by Emir Djaafar Abd el-Kader, curator of the National Museum of Damascus—even as merchants, eager to capitalise on the stories, hawked modern forgeries and unrelated ancient objects said to come from the tombs of Emesa.The prompt intervention of el-Kader, who investigated the finds and interrogated the looters, allowed the finds to be recovered and well-understood.

Today it's also one of the most written languages online. And with so many Chinese people interested in learning English, it couldn't be easier to find a friend for language learning. You just have to know where to look for them.\\nThe really good place to look for them is QQ. QQ has the same status  in China as AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) does in the US. It is reported that at any moment, up to 9,000,000 people are using QQ. They're at work, or in a web cafe , or at home, and the information of the users can be found. If you sign on with your address set to \\"abroad\\", you'll soon find that many thousands of them are interested in speaking to you!

This provides an opportunity for cultural exchange between English speakers and native Chinese speakers online.\\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided by this passage, we can infer that the writer wrote this passage mainly to tell a way of learning Chinese through language exchange partners found via QQ chatrooms; option A reflects the main purpose of writing accurately and thus should be selected as your answer."},{"source":"See the conversation.

The possible adverse effects of a medial tear documented histologically and produced during balloon angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in 30 fully heparinized (100 U/kg body weight) normal pigs. Scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial denudation and extensive platelet deposition in all dilated arterial segments. Visible macroscopic mural thrombus was present within an hour of the procedure in 29 (91%) of the 32 arteries that had a medial tear documented by histologic study; the tear produced an indium-111-labeled platelet deposition of 116.4 +/- 26.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (mean +/- SE) and total thrombotic occlusion in 2 arteries (4%). None of the 24 arteries without a medial tear had a thrombus, and the mean platelet deposition in that group was 7.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (p less than 0.0008). In 12 pigs scanned with a gamma camera, visible thrombus was associated with platelet deposition in excess of 20 X 10(6)/cm2 in 12 arteries, 9 of which had a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram. Thus, arterial angioplasty causes deep arterial injury, which appears to be a major cause of mural thrombosis, heavy platelet deposition, a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram and acute arterial occlusion. A positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram was always associated with macroscopic thrombus of at least 20 > 10(6) platelets/cm2 and underlying deep arterial injury.","target":"Deep arterial injury during experimental angioplasty: relation to a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram, quantitative platelet deposition and mural thrombosis","rationale":"The title should contain the following key ideas: (1) deep arterial injury, (2) experimental angioplasty, (3) positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram and thrombosis.

Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions, and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in popular music history. Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals.\\n\\nIn 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting the building into a recording studio and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.  The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for \\"Dogs\\", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part \\"Pigs on the Wing\\". Wright commented: \\"It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there.\\" Mason recalled: \\"Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately.\\" Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: \\"Animals... wasn't a fun record to make ... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me.\\"  Released in January 1977, the album peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three. NME described the album as \\"one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music\\", and Melody Maker's Karl Dallas called it \\"[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific\\".  Pink Floyd performed much of the album's material during their \\"In the Flesh\\" tour. It was the band's first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band. Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. At the Montreal Olympic Stadium, a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them. The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish.

Some modern research argues that these figures may be too high. Firstly, a list of British soldiers killed, compiled for a fund to aid the families of dead soldiers, listed just 530 names. Secondly, professor Louis Cullen, through an examination of depletion of the population in County Wexford between 1798 and 1820, put the fatalities in that county due to the rebellion at 6,000. Historian Thomas Bartlett therefore argues, \\"a death toll of 10,000 for the entire island would seem to be in order\\". Other modern historians believe that the death toll may be even higher than contemporary estimates suggest as the widespread fear of repression among relatives of slain rebels led to mass concealment of casualties. By the centenary of the Rebellion in 1898, conservative Irish nationalists and the Catholic Church would both claim that the United Irishmen had been fighting for \\"Faith and Fatherland\\", and this version of events is still, to some extent, the lasting popular memory of the rebellion. A series of popular \\"98 Clubs\\" were formed. At the bicentenary in 1998, the non-sectarian and democratic ideals of the Rebellion were emphasised in official commemorations, reflecting the desire for reconciliation at the time of the Good Friday Agreement which was hoped would end \\"The Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland. The popular Irish ballad The Rising of the Moon recounts the loss of the United Irishmen.

The couple had met during World War II in Raleigh, North Carolina, when Allman was on leave from the U.S. Army, and were later married. Their first child, Duane Allman, was born in Nashville in 1946. On December 26, 1949, Willis offered a hitchhiker a ride home and was subsequently shot and killed in Norfolk, Virginia.\\n\\nAfter the dissolution of the Allman Brothers, Allman kept busy performing music with his solo band, releasing the live album Gregg Allman Live: Back to Macon, GA in 2015. In 2016, he received an honorary doctorate from Mercer University in Macon, presented by former President Jimmy Carter. However, his health problems remained; he had atrial fibrillation, and though he kept it private, his liver cancer had returned. \\"He kept it very private because he wanted to continue to play music until he couldn't\\", his manager Michael Lehman said. He attempted to keep a light schedule at the advice of doctors, who warned that too many performances might amplify his conditions. His last concert took place in Atlanta at his own Laid Back Festival along with ZZ Top at Lakewood Amphitheatre on Saturday October 29, 2016, and he continued to cancel concerts citing \\"serious health issues\\". He denied reports that he had entered hospice care, but was resting at home on doctor's orders.  Allman died at his home in Richmond Hill, Georgia, on May 27, 2017, due to complications from liver cancer. He was 69 years old. His funeral took place at Snow's Memorial Chapel in Macon on June 3, and was attended by once-estranged bandmate Dickey Betts, his ex-wife Cher, and former President Carter, among others. According to Rolling Stone, the mourners dressed casually in jeans per Allman's request, and \\"hundreds of fans, many wearing Allman Brothers shirts and listening to the band's music, lined the route along the funeral procession.\\" He was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, beside his brother Duane, and fellow band member Berry Oakley.  Before his death, Allman recorded his last album, Southern Blood, with producer Don Was at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The album was recorded with his then-current backing band. The album was released on September 8, 2017, and received critical acclaim.  In My Cross to Bear, Allman reflected on his life and career:  Music is my life's blood. I love music, I love to play good music, and I love to play music for people who appreciate it. And when it's all said and done, I'll go to my grave and my brother will greet me, saying, \\"Nice work, little brother--you did all right.\\" I must have said this a million times, but if I died today, I have had me a blast.\\n\\nwas that album popular","target":"The album was released on September 8, 2017, and received critical acclaim.","rationale":"The last sentence of the given context states: The album was released on September 8, 2017, and received critical acclaim.\\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: Yes"},{"source":"The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions \\"to show full co-operation\\" Clinton said.\\n\\nQuestion with options: Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The paragraph states that the United States \\"would like to see\\" U.N. weapons inspectors return (implies they are not there currently).

It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ... I couldn't begin to describe – above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to a blaze of light, affected me with an excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since. This was not Liszt—perhaps less perfect, technically—but it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving ...\\"The biographer of Chopin, Frederick Niecks, sought Alkan for his recollections in 1880 but was sternly denied access by Alkan's concierge – \\"To my ... enquiry when he could be found at home, the reply was a ... decisive 'Never'.\\" However, a few days later he found Alkan at Érard's, and Niecks writes of their meeting that \\"his reception of me was not...","target":"d'Indy","rationale":"From the article, we learn that Vincent d'Indy was a young man who listened to Alkan and was \\"riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing\\".\\nAlkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata at which point d'Indy has said: \\"What happened to ...

The Quran is considered an inimitable miracle by Muslims, effective until the Day of Resurrection—and, thereby, the central proof granted to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status. The concept of inimitability originates in the Quran where in five different verses opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: \\"If men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this Quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another.\\" So the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the Quran, come forward and create something like it.

Medieval Muslim scholars including al-Jurjani (d. 1078) and al-Baqillani (d. 1013) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran. Others argue that the Quran contains noble ideas, has inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations in individual level and in the history. Some scholars state that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"fly","rationale":"The context says that most bird species are able to fly.

She was fun and I knew from that time she already struggled with anxiety to the point of not being able to do some tests out of nervousness, but it was getting worse each year.\\n\\nWhen school ended we both went to college we kept hanging out. We would go to clubs, bars and the beach, always by her proposal. It wasn't really my thing, I rarely had fun at those outings and I would much prefer staying home alone in my computer. I knew she couldn't stand to stay home alone because she'd get anxiety attacks so I usually accepted it just to keep her company.\\n\\nBut I was getting more and more annoyed by wasting my time and money in places I did not enjoyed. Going out with her was tiring. And even when we'd stay in, she always wanted to do something I was not in the mood for and I counted the seconds until she left.\\n\\nSo I decided to turn down every proposal to hang out with her, hoping she would eventually stop trying. That went on for months and during that time, I found out she was doing much worse with her anxiety and now depression. It was paralyzing her life and I tried to offer some comfort through texts. I knew her she wasn't well, but I can't say I actually felt bad for her, my only concern was not being too much of an asshole by saying \\"I don't want to be your friend anymore\\", specially now that she was struggling with her mental health. I dreaded that conversation and the awkwardness of running into her after that.\\n\\nI kept texting her because I didn't mind it. But now her invitations were loaded with guilt-tripping about her wanting to hurt herself if she stayed home so she really needed me to go out with her. That's when I got repulsed and wanted to cut thing off as soon as possible.\\n\\nI struggled with finding words not to hurt her. So a basically said I did not feel comfortable hanging out with her anymore because we had grown apart and that if she ever wanted to vent or wanted advise, she could still talk to me. As I expected, she was really hurt to hear this and, to my surprise, she said she considered me her best friend, she was also a little offended by the offer to talk to her when she was bad as it would feel like I was doing it out of pity.\\n\\nShe vented about it to all of our mutual friends and some of them gave me the benefit of the doubt but when they asked me to explain, they were even more astonished by my coldness. I didn't lose lose any other friend because of this, but I'm sure they lost any admiration they ever had for me.\\n\\nAt the time I felt I really needed to do it but now I can't justify this behavior anymore.","target":"answerable","rationale":"The woman in this story has already cut off contact with the friend, and she seems to be feeling guilty about it. The friend is struggling with anxiety and depression, and relies on socializing with friends to help her feel better.

She waited months before doing so because she knew that it would hurt her friend's feelings. However, by continuing to hang out with her when she was not enjoying herself, she was making things worse for both of them. There is no mention of any effort from the woman in this story to talk openly and honestly about their friendship or how either of them might improve things between them. Instead, by waiting months before cutting off contact entirely without explanation or warning (and after a period of rejecting all invitations), the woman in this story acted selfishly and callously towards a person who needed support during an especially difficult time in their life.

In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to explore differences in the intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The results revealed that the small intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets infected with PEDV showed low diversity and was dominated by Proteobacteria (49.1%). Additionally, the composition of the small intestinal microbiota of sucking piglets infected with PEDV showed marked differences from that of the uninfected piglets. Some of the taxa showing differences in abundance between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with PEDV were associated with cellular transport and catabolism, energy metabolism, the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and amino acid metabolism as determined through the prediction of microbial function based on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Therefore, adjusting the intestinal microbiota might be a promising method for the prevention or treatment of PEDV.","target":"Differences in the intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","rationale":"The title should reflect the differences between the small intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets infected with PEDV and those of uninfected piglets.

The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'main subject' with the subject 'the deadly bees'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- actor\\n - company\\n - computing\\n - detective\\n - english\\n - history\\n - insects\\n - london\\n - music\\n - police\\n - science\\n - technology\\n - television","target":"insects","rationale":"The information provided in the question describes a series of different topics, including bees (insects), forensic science, movies and television shows that include The Deadly Bees as well as actors Boris Karloff and Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\nIn this example, you have to choose from all 12 options which entity has the relation 'main subject' with \\"the deadly bees\\".

And while the number of activities we delay doing in any given week varies from person to person, it's fair to say that none of us is super-efficient 100 percent of the time.\\nA study revealed that we spend about 218 minutes procrastinating every day, which amounts to 55 days of lost time each year. We might not think these figures particularly worthy of worry, but when we look at the overall impact of procrastination on our lives, _ Not only does this cost financial loss, it also affects peace of mind. And procrastination isn't just a money thief ---- it steals time too. In general, people who continually put things off are unhappier, as well as being less wealthy and healthy.\\nSo why do we do it? \\"When we avoid taking action, we're really avoiding pain,\\" explains psychiatrist   Phil Stutz. For most of us, pain avoidance isn't limited to one situation. It applies to almost anything that's painful. Most of us try our best never to leave a comfort zone.

The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003.\\n\\nSupernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Supernature debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and \\"Ooh La La\\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S's commercial in 2013.  \\"Ooh La La\\", the album's lead single, became Goldfrapp's first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single \\"because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album\\". \\"Ooh La La\\" became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. \\"Number 1\\" was released as the album's second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album's third single \\"Ride a White Horse\\" was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. \\"Fly Me Away\\" was released as the album's fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors.

Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach.

Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and Santino Rice, who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season 8, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, and all stars 1, and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging has been provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (better known as Billy B), Mike Ruiz, Jeffrey Moran (Absolut Vodka marketing executive), or Lucian Piane.

Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, at the time of its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.\\nAlthough Watts received many offers to buy the painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it would be inappropriate not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.\\nAs cheap reproductions of Hope, and from 1908 high-quality prints, began to circulate in large quantities, it became a widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion.

Classical Palmyra had a distinctive culture, based on a local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome. To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or in addition to a second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a \\"boule\\" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.\\nThe culture of Persia influenced Palmyrene military tactics, dress and court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern cities such as Edessa or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was Cassius Longinus.Palmyra had a large agora. However, unlike the Greek Agoras (public gathering places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used in some of the tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar to that used in Ancient Egypt.","target":"Eastern caravanserai","rationale":"The context of the paragraph is about Palmyra, a historic city in Syria. The first sentence states that it was most affiliated with western Syria and heavily influenced by Greek and Roman culture. It then goes on to describe its agora as resembling an \\"Eastern caravanserai.\\" A caravanserai is an inn where travelers can rest, so this implies that the agoras were not very public spaces or open gathering places like those found in Greece - they instead acted more as places for commerce than social interaction.

Roche's rise coincided with that of fellow Irishman Sean Kelly. Although one of the finest cyclists of his generation and admired for his pedalling style, he struggled with knee injuries and never contended in the Grand Tours post-1987.\\n\\nRoche scored his first professional victory by beating Bernard Hinault in the Tour of Corsica. Less than a month later he won Paris-Nice (where he became the first, and still the only, new pro to win Paris-Nice) despite illness following the descent from Mont Ventoux and finished his debut season with victories in the Tour de Corse, Circuit d'Indre-et-Loire and Etoile des Espoirs races with a second place behind Hinault in the Grand Prix des Nations. In total, his debut yielded 10 victories.  In 1982 his best performance was second in the Amstel Gold Race behind Jan Raas, but his rise continued in 1983 with victories in the Tour de Romandie, Grand Prix de Wallonie, Etoile des Espoirs and Paris-Bourges. In the 1983 Tour de France, Roche finished 13th and he finished the 1983 season with a bronze medal in the world cycling championship at Alterheim in Zurich.  In 1984, riding for La Redoute following contractual wrangles with Peugeot (the settlement of which led Roche to sport Peugeot shorts for two years before winning a court action against Velo Club de Paris Peugeot) he repeated his Tour de Romandie win, won Nice-Alassio, Subida a Arrate and was second in Paris-Nice. He finished 25th in that year's Tour de France.  In 1985, Roche won the Criterium International, the Route du Sud and came second in Paris-Nice and third in Liege-Bastogne-Liege.

Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.\\n\\nIn the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.\\n\\nWould Kenya have less or more organic matter stored in the \\"O horizon\\" than Tanzania?","target":"less","rationale":"The passage states that due to the frequent occurrence of fires in grasslands, combined with relatively high acidity levels under forests, organic matter is stored primarily within the forest floor (O horizon) and A Horizon.

Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: The Jones family went jogging  last Saturday.

He signed for Dundee United in 1979 and spent his entire professional playing career with the club until his retirement in 2000. With him United were Scottish champions in 1983 and Scottish Cup winners in 1994. European runs there included reaching the 1983-84 European Cup semi final and the 1987 UEFA Cup Final.\\n\\nAfter retiring as a player, Malpas assumed full-time coaching duties at Tannadice, having been acting as player/coach since 1991. He was part of the temporary management team following the dismissal of Alex Smith in October 2002, but left the club in January 2003.  He initially joined Motherwell as assistant manager to former coaching colleague Terry Butcher. Malpas became Motherwell manager in May 2006, following Butcher's departure to coach Sydney FC. He left the club in June 2007 after one season in charge, having taken the team from a comfortable mid-table position to one that narrowly avoided relegation. Malpas became caretaker manager of the Scotland under-21 team in August 2007, but missed out on the permanent position to Billy Stark.  In January 2008, Malpas became manager of Swindon Town after the takeover of the club by local businessman Andrew Fitton, replacing former Dundee United teammate Paul Sturrock. Malpas was sacked by chairman Andrew Fitton on 14 November 2008 after a poor run of results and shock exits in the FA Cup to Histon and in the Football League Trophy within a week. He joined Terry Butcher again as assistant, this time at SPL club Inverness Caledonian Thistle. In 2013, Malpas moved with Butcher to Hibernian, rejecting the chance to manage Inverness. Butcher and Malpas both left Hibernian in June 2014, after the club had been relegated from the Scottish Premiership.  Malpas became director of football at Raith Rovers on 26 December 2014. He left Raith Rovers on 22 May 2015 and was inducted to the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in October 2015.

She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives.\\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\\nThat’s right, you STOP!\\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\\nThis isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).\\nWho wrote the book \\"Come As You Are\\"?\\n- A student\\n- Emily Nagoski\\n- An anonymous author\\n- not enough information","target":"Emily Nagoski","rationale":"The text briefly introduces Emily Nagoski and her book \\"Come As You Are\\".\\nEmily is a researcher who has studied human sexuality.

These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.The satirical single \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' \\"Paperback Writer\\". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.\\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was a dry run for the band's next album Face to Face, which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and harpsichord.

This idea soon went out of fashion, but was brought back by a Japanese television host named Toshitaka Nomi in the 1970s. The belief is still strong in Japan and is increasingly popular in neighboring countries. _ A recent study showed 76 percent of Koreans aged between13 and 64 believing in the blood-type personality connection. Though most Asians might believe in the blood-type theory, for many it seems harmless and not something to be taken too seriously.\\nIs the belief true? The scientists in Asia largely think the belief as a modern-day superstition . Most studies have failed to find any strong connection between blood and personality. Generally, scientists are against making predictions or important decisions based on this questionable theory.\\nQuestion: Which of the following is true according to the passage?\\nOptions: A: Most scientists in Asia don't believe in the theory.\\nB: The blood-type theory began in Japan in the 1970s.\\nC: The blood-type personality theory is about blood type.\\nD: People don't change their personality to match the theory.","target":"A","rationale":"The paragraph states that the blood-type personality theory was originally developed by a Japanese scientist in 1927.

Perhaps yes. Scientists have found the gene that determines skin color1.\\n    The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 percent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 percent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of science.\\n    Scientists have changed the color1 of a dark-striped zebrafish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebrafish skin color1 is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanin  . The number, size and darkness of melanin per pigment cell determine skin color1.\\n    It appears that, like the golden zebrafish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation   in the gene for melanin production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebrafish genes.\\n    Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun , which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng.\\n    \\"Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin color1,\\" said Cheng.\\n    The new discovery could lead to medical treatments for skin cancer. It also could lead to research into ways to change skin color1 without damaging it like chemical treatment did on Michael Jackson. ks5u\\nQuestion: Scientists have done an experiment on a dark-striped zebrafish in order to   _  .\\nOptions: A: find the different genes of humans'\\nB: prove the humans' skin color1 is similar to that of zebrafish in its formation\\nC: find out the reason why the Africans' skin color1 is dark\\nD: find out the ways of changing people's skin color1","target":"B","rationale":"Here is an example of a question that can be solved by looking back and picking the correct answer based on what we know about genes.

In addition, we noticed a cumulative prolongation of bleeding time by a combination of quinidine and aspirin. We postulated that because both quinidine and aspirin inhibit epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, a cumulative effect of the two drugs might be responsible for the hemostatic defect. In studies using normal human platelets, we confirmed a marked reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation by the combination of these two agents. To further study the potential mechanism of this cumulative effect, platelet lysates were incubated with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist tritiated yohimbine in the presence of quinidine and aspirin. On the basis of the radioligand binding data, the dissociation constant (KD) of alpha 2-adrenoceptors was observed to increase in the presence of quinidine as well as aspirin. The combination of these two agents caused a marked increase in the KD of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors without alteration in the number of receptor sites. These data suggest that the cumulative effects of quinidine and aspirin on platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor KD may relate to the significant reduction in epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation. This phenomenon, coupled with other well-known effects of aspirin on the platelet release reaction and arachidonate metabolism, may lead to bleeding problems in some patients receiving this combination. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Cumulative effects of quinidine and aspirin on bleeding time and platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors: potential mechanism of bleeding diathesis in patients receiving this combination. option2: Late intracranial metastasis from esthesioneuroblastoma: case report and review of the literature.","target":"Cumulative effects of quinidine and aspirin on bleeding time and platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors: potential mechanism of bleeding diathesis in patients receiving this combination","rationale":"The abstract summarizes the results of a study investigating the effects of quinidine and aspirin on bleeding time and platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors.

She had no hypertension or other signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. Plasma cortisol levels were greatly elevated and did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Cortisol binding to transcortin was normal. Plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels were also increased, but 17-hydroxyprogesterone and aldosterone levels were normal. Further studies revealed an increased cortisol production rate, increased 24-h urinary cortisol excretion, increased plasma ACTH levels, a normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol at an elevated level, and normal increments of plasma ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The father and two brothers also had increased plasma cortisol levels, which did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Chronic therapy with dexamethasone (at first 1 and later 0.5 mg, three times daily) for more than 30 weeks resulted in decreased hirsutism, normalization of scalp hair and menstrual cyclicity, and normal plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels.

In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.\\n\\nIn which case the reactants concentration would increase, case A or case B?\\n\\nHint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.","target":"case B","rationale":"In case A forward reaction is favored and in case B reverse reaction was favored.

Mangroves cover between more than 600 km2  of the Thai shores of Malay Peninsula whereas seagrass meadows occupy an area of 79 km2 .:25-26 Mangroves are largely responsible for the high productivity of the coastal waters - their roots trap soil and sediment and provide shelter from predators and nursery for fish and small aquatic organisms.

They were partly replanted after that, but their area is still gradually decreasing due to human activities.:6-7 Other important sources of nutrients in the Andaman Sea are seagrass and the mud bottoms of lagoons and coastal areas. They also create a habitat or temporal shelter for many burrowing and benthic organisms. Many aquatic species migrate from and to seagrass either daily or at certain stages of their life cycle. The human activities which damage seagrass beds include waste water discharge from coastal industry, shrimp farms and other forms of coastal development, as well as trawling and the use of push nets and dragnets.

His parents, Lewis Hochberg and Mary Ricing, were Yiddish-speaking Orthodox Jews who had emigrated from Russia.  He later adopted the name Edgar Harburg, and came to be best known as Edgar \\"Yip\\" Harburg. He attended Townsend Harris High School, where he and Ira Gershwin, who met over a shared fondness for Gilbert and Sullivan, worked on the school paper and became lifelong friends. According to his son Ernie Harburg, Gilbert and Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw taught his father, a \\"democratic socialist, [and] sworn challenger of all tyranny against the people, that 'humor is an act of courage' and dissent\\".  After World War I, Harburg returned to New York and graduated from City College (later part of the City University of New York), which Ira Gershwin had initially attended with him, in 1921. After Harburg married and had two children, he started writing light verse for local newspapers. He became a co-owner of Consolidated Electrical Appliance Company, but the company went bankrupt following the crash of 1929, leaving Harburg \\"anywhere from $50,000 - $70,000 in debt,\\" which he insisted on paying back over the course of the next few decades. At this point, Harburg and Ira Gershwin agreed that Harburg should start writing song lyrics.  Gershwin introduced Harburg to Jay Gorney, who collaborated with him on songs for an Earl Carroll Broadway review (Earl Carroll's Sketchbook): the show was successful and Harburg was engaged as lyricist for a series of successful revues, including Americana in 1932, for which he wrote the lyrics of \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" to the tune of a lullaby Gorney had learned as a child in Russia.

Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for \\"industrial fluctuations\\" based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates.

However, the time course of these acute effects and whether they are sustained during chronic exposure to the NSAIDs are unknown. Accordingly, using standard clearance and balance techniques, we investigated the effects of acute (zero to four hours) and chronic (five days) oral administration of two different NSAIDs on renal function in patients with stable, mild to moderate chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and in normal subjects. In patients, acute oral administration of ketoprofen (K) and indomethacin (I) resulted in significant decreases in GFR (K: from 36 +/- 3 to 20 +/- 4 ml/min, P = 0.001; I: from 37 +/- 6 to 30 +/- 7 ml/min, P = 0.032; in RPF (K: from 194 +/- 21 to 146 +/- 21 ml/min, P = 0.002; I: from 222 +/- 33 to 147 +/- 18 ml/min, P = 0.016); and in urinary PGE2 excretion (K: from 0.60 +/- 0.25 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 ng/min, P = 0.05; I: from 0.34 +/- 0.06 to 0.18 +/- 0.06 ng/min, P = 0.042).

Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).\\n\\n- Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.\\n\\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor.

The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.\\n\\n- Rayon is a manufactured regenerated cellulose fiber. It is made from purified cellulose, primarily from wood pulp, which is chemically converted into a soluble compound. It is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments which are chemically solidified, resulting in synthetic fibers of nearly pure cellulose. Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber. Specific types of rayon include viscose, modal and lyocell, each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product.\\n\\n- Tiddlywinks is an indoor game played on a flat felt mat with sets of small discs called \`\` winks '' , a pot , which is the target , and a collection of squidgers , which are also discs . Players use a \`\` squidger '' ( nowadays made of plastic ) to shoot a wink into flight by flicking the squidger across the top of a wink and then over its edge , thereby propelling it into the air . The offensive objective of the game is to score points by sending your own winks into the pot. The defensive objective of the game is to prevent your opponents from potting their winks by \`\` squopping '' them : shooting your own winks to land on top of your opponents ' winks . As part of strategic gameplay , players often attempt to squop their opponents ' winks and develop , maintain and break up large piles of winks . Tiddlywinks is sometimes considered a simpleminded , frivolous children 's game , rather than a strategic , adult game . However , the modern competitive adult game of tiddlywinks made a strong comeback at the University of Cambridge in 1955 . The modern game uses far more complex rules and a consistent set of high - grade equipment .\\n\\n- Acrylonitrile is an organic compound with the formula CHCHCN. It is a colorless volatile liquid, although commercial samples can be yellow due to impurities. In terms of its molecular structure, it consists of a vinyl group linked to a nitrile. It is an important monomer for the manufacture of useful plastics such as polyacrylonitrile. It is reactive and toxic at low doses.

Since this is the case for scientist A, it can be inferred that Scientist B did not make substantial improvements to his theory and may have even replaced or dismissed key parts of previous theories in favor of new ones. \\n\\nSo, based on these inferences made from the question's background information and paragraphs, we predict that scientist A might not have improved an earlier idea while scientist B did so; hence our answer would be Scientist A"},{"source":"Article: When I was about 10 one day, I was walking down the street with my mother. She stopped to speak to Mr. Lee. I knew I could see Mr. Lee anytime around the neighborhood, so I just stood there. After we passed him, my mother stopped and said something unforgettable, \\"You let that be the last time you ever walk by somebody you know without opening your mouth to speak, because even a dog can wag its tail when it passes you on the street.\\" That sentence sounds simple but it made me become who I am.\\nAt work, I used to say hello to the president of the company and ask him how our business was doing. But I also spoke to the people in the cafe and people who cleaned the buildings, and asked them how their children were doing, for every single person deserves to be accepted, no matter how humble  they are. I remember that after a few years of passing by the president, I had the courage to ask him for a chat. We had a great talk. At some point, when I asked him how far he thought I could go in his company, he said that if I wanted to, I could get all the way to his seat.\\nI've become vice-president, but that hasn't changed how I treat people. I speak to people wherever I am. Speaking to people creates a pathway into their world, and it lets them come into mine, too.\\nThe day you speak to someone who has his head down and then see him lift it up and smile, you will realize how powerful it is just to open your mouth and say hello.\\nQuestion: For the writer, saying hello to others  _  .\\nYes or no, is the answer \\"has become a habit and a way of life.\\"?","target":"Yes","rationale":"For the writer, saying hello to others has become a habit and a way of life. This is implied in the first paragraph when he says that his mother's comment about dogs wagging their tails made him become who he was.
