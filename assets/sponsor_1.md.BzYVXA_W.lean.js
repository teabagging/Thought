Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood. \\"It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,\\" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. \\"There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.\\n\\nParagraph: Two students studied animal behavior for the biology class.

She begs Ginny to let her live with them, but Ginny leaves it up to Humpty, who angrily kicked her out when she married her mobster boyfriend Frank and threw away her college education and chance for a better life. Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI. Humpty lets her stay on the condition that she save money to return to college and better her life. Ginny gets her a waitressing job where she works.\\nGinny used to be an actress and was happily married, but her infidelity caused her husband to divorce her. She and Humpty are raising her young son Ritchie, a troubled boy who habitually gets into trouble by setting fires.

They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be. The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison's \\"critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music\\" and for his having \\"advanced society's comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music\\". Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\".In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as \\"one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced\\", was among the performers of Monty Python's \\"Lumberjack Song\\". The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.In 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh.

Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875.\\nThe company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford.

It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed. When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \\"Dunstable, New Hampshire\\" was renamed \\"Nashua\\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \\"Indian Head\\".

For much of her career, Hedren's year of birth was reported as 1935. In 2004, however, she acknowledged that she was actually born in 1930 (which is consistent with the birth registration index at the Minnesota Historical Society). Her paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants, while her maternal ancestry is German and Norwegian.\\nContext: The Birds (1963) was Hedren's screen debut. Hitchcock became her drama coach, and gave her an education in film-making as she attended many of the production meetings such as script, music or photography conferences. Hedren said, \\"I probably learned in three years what it would have taken me 15 years to learn otherwise.\\" She learned how to break down a script, to become another character, and to study the relationship of different characters. Hedren portrayed her role of Melanie Daniels as Hitchcock requested. She said, \\"He gives his actors very little leeway. He'll listen, but he has a very definite plan in mind as to how he wants his characters to act. With me, it was understandable, because I was not an actress of stature. I welcomed his guidance.\\"  During the six months of principal photography, Hedren's schedule was tight, as she was only given one afternoon off a week. At first, she found the shooting \\"wonderful\\". Hitchcock told a reporter, after a few weeks of filming, that she was remarkable, and said, \\"She's already reaching the lows and highs of terror.\\" Nonetheless, Hedren recalled the week she did the final bird attack scene in a second-floor bedroom as the worst of her life. Before filming it, she asked Hitchcock about her character's motivations to go upstairs, and his response was, \\"Because I tell you to.\\" She was then assured that the crew would use mechanical birds. Instead, Hedren endured five solid days of prop men, protected by thick leather gloves, flinging dozens of live gulls, ravens and crows at her (their beaks clamped shut with elastic bands). In a state of exhaustion, when one of the birds gouged her cheek and narrowly missed her eye, Hedren sat down on the set and began crying. A physician ordered a week's rest. Hitchcock protested, according to Hedren, saying there was nobody but her to film. The doctor's reply was, \\"Are you trying to kill her?\\" She said the week also appeared to be an ordeal for the director.  Universal's executives, who did not back Hitchcock's decision to hire Hedren in the first place, were impressed with her performance and Wasserman described it as \\"remarkable\\". While promoting The Birds, Hitchcock was full of praise for his new protegee, and compared her to Grace Kelly. \\"Tippi has a faster tempo, city glibness, more humor [than Grace Kelly]. She displayed jaunty assuredness, pertness, an attractive throw of the head. And she memorized and read lines extraordinarily well and is sharper in expression.\\" The film was screened out of competition in May at a prestigious invitational showing at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. Hedren's performance was praised in Variety's review: \\"Aside from the birds, the film belongs to Hedren, who makes an auspicious screen bow. She virtually has to carry the picture alone for the first forty-five minute stretch, prior to the advent of the first wave of organized attackers from the sky. Miss Hedren has a star quality and Hitchcock has provided her with a potent vehicle to launch her career\\". Hedren received the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, tied with Elke Sommer and Ursula Andress.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.”\\nLarisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...\\nWhat is most likely going to be Larisa's next job?\\n- studying depictions of India\\n- working on medieval tradition\\n- not enough information\\n- working with other manuscripts","target":"working with other manuscripts","rationale":"In this passage, Larisa is studying the illuminations in a medieval manuscript.

Her errant behavior prompts her frustrated boyfriend Tim to break up with her and evict her from their New York City apartment. Forced to move back to her hometown in New England (the fictional Mainhead), Gloria reunites with her childhood friend Oscar, who now runs his late father's bar. Oscar is warm and welcoming to Gloria; he brings her an old television set for her unfurnished house and offers her a job at the bar to help her, which Gloria accepts.\\nWorking at the bar aggravates Gloria's alcohol problem. Each shift, she hangs out and drinks until morning with Oscar and his friends, Garth and Joel, while sleeping it off on a bench near a children's playground. At the same time, a giant reptilian monster appears in Seoul, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Gradually, Gloria realizes that when she walks through the playground at exactly 8:05 am, she causes the monster to manifest and is able to remotely control the monster's movements, which mirror her own.\\nGloria reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends; however, when Oscar steps onto the playground, he causes a giant robot to appear in Seoul. Gloria ultimately tries to make amends by having the monster spell out an apology in Korean, to the delight of the South Koreans and the media, and begins to avoid both the playground and alcohol.\\nAfter spending the night with Joel, Gloria discovers that a drunken Oscar is using the robot to taunt South Korea. After a tense confrontation, Gloria manages to make him leave. Oscar is jealous, believing that something happened between Gloria and Joel. Later that night at the bar, he drunkenly insults his friends and demands that Gloria drinks, then orders her to do so by threatening to return to the playground if she does not. The next morning, a sobered-up Oscar confesses his remorse and pleads with Gloria to forgive him. Gloria accepts his apology, but Oscar's controlling attitude becomes clear.","target":"Gloria","rationale":"The context is about Gloria's life.

Visible light is produced by vibrations and rotations of atoms and molecules, as well as by electronic transitions within atoms and molecules. The receivers or detectors of light largely utilize electronic transitions. We say the atoms and molecules are excited when they absorb and relax when they emit through electronic transitions. Figure 24.16 shows this part of the spectrum, together with the colors associated with particular pure wavelengths. We usually refer to visible light as having wavelengths of between 400 nm and 750 nm. (The retina of the eye actually responds to the lowest ultraviolet frequencies, but these do not normally reach the retina because they are absorbed by the cornea and lens of the eye. ) Red light has the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths, while violet has the highest frequencies and shortest wavelengths. Blackbody radiation from the Sun peaks in the visible part of the spectrum but is more intense in the red than in the violet, making the Sun yellowish in appearance.\\n\\n\\nQ: Visible light is the narrow segment of what, to which the normal human eye responds?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"electromagnetic spectrum","rationale":"The paragraph mentions the components of visible light and its relationship to atoms, molecules, electronic transitions.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. \\nQuestion: What does the abort system include? \\nIs it Thrusters?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abort system will be on top of the capsule.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it.

Moreover, we present a method of fine-tuning vector quantized DNNs to recover the performance loss after quantization.

I use 4-5 good juicy lemons that make about 10 - 12 oz. of juice and refrigerated in a bottle with a small neck.. I can then make lemon, ice and water or other drinks when I'm thirsty or use it for cooking.. Lasts pretty much 2 weeks. For example, if your lemonade recipe calls for 2 cups of fresh-squeezed juice, freeze a few 2-cup packages for that use. For best flavor, thaw the juice overnight in your refrigerator rather than in the microwave. Well-wrapped lemon juice will retain most of its flavor for four to six months. 4. First, warm lemons give more juice than cold lemons. If your lemons are refrigerated, warm them in a bowl of hot water or prick them a few times with a fork and zap them in the microwave for just a few seconds. Second, press down on each lemon with your hand and roll it on the counter a few times. Lemons Expiration Date. Of course, all foods last for a shorter period of time if they are not stored properly. But remember that lemons, like a lot of other fresh fruits, usually do not have a use by date or best before date so you will have to use the date purchased. We juice our lemons and put them in a glass bottle in the refrigerator. We use about 4 oz. a week and it keeps nicely. I also juiced a bunch of limes, put them in ice cube trays ( 1 lime per cube) froze them, wrapped them individually in plastic wrap and put in freezer bag. Fresh lemons can last on the counter for two to four weeks. If the lemons are refrigerated, they stay fresh for one to two months.... Fresh lemons can last on the counter for two to four weeks. If the lemons are refrigerated, they stay fresh for one to two months. Cut lemons that aren't refrigerated must be used the same day. If the lemons are cut and placed in the refrigerator, they stay fresh for two to three days. Lemon juice in a resealable container stays fresh in the refrigerator for four to six months. Fresh-squeezed lemonade should be consumed the same day it is prepared if it is not refrigerated. If the beverage is refrigerated, it can be consumed for up to a week. 2. Refrigerator Storage. A few of the volatile flavor compounds in lemon juice break down within minutes of squeezing, but most will last for a few days. If you plan to use your lemon juice in lemonade, those first few days are the ideal time. Your juice will retain enough of its fresh flavor to be useful in cooking or baking for up to two weeks, though sediment will begin to settle out. After that, although your lemon juice will remain food safe, its flavor deteriorates badly. You can help lemons keep fresh longer by storing them in your refrigerator drawer. If lemons were purchased in a plastic bag, remove them from the bag which could have trapped moisture which will cause the lemons to soften and spoil. How long do lemons last? The shelf life of lemons depends on a variety of factors, since there is not usually a sell by date, so the only date you can go by is the purchased date or picked date.

Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of \\"Homogenic\\" was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. \\"Homogenic\\" was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. \\"Homogenic\\" marked the first of several production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the \\"Billboard\\" 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.\\n\\n- A record chart also called a music chart is a ranking of recorded music according to popularity during a given period of time.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\\n\\n- Medúlla is the fifth solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released on 30 August 2004 by One Little Indian.

Over her four-decade career, she has developed an eclectic musical style that draws on a wide range of influences and genres spanning electronic, pop, experimental, classical, trip hop, IDM, and avant-garde styles. She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single \\"Birthday\\" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. Björk embarked on a solo career in 1993, coming to prominence as a solo artist with albums such as \\"Debut\\" (1993), \\"Post\\" (1995), and \\"Homogenic\\" (1997), while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects. \\n\\n- Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music.

In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government.

Situated in Berlin during the Weimar Republic in 1931, under the presence of the growing Nazi Party, the film is loosely based on the 1966 Broadway musical Cabaret by Kander and Ebb, which was adapted from the novel The Berlin Stories / Goodbye to Berlin (1939) by Christopher Isherwood and the 1951 play I Am a Camera adapted from the same book. Only a few numbers from the stage score were used for the film; Kander and Ebb wrote new ones to replace those that were discarded. In the traditional manner of musical theater, called an \\"integrated musical\\", every significant character in the stage version sings to express his or her own emotion and to advance the plot.\\n\\nRoger Ebert gave a positive review, saying: \\"This is no ordinary musical.

Taking its form from political cabaret, it's a satire of temptations. In a prodigious balancing act, Bob Fosse, the choreographer-director, keeps the period--Berlin, 1931--at a cool distance. We see the decadence as garish and sleazy; yet we also see the animal energy in it--everything seems to become sexualized. The movie does not exploit decadence; rather, it gives it its due.

Without Derek Carr due to a fracture in his back, EJ Manuel started for the Raiders. The Raiders defense again struggled, giving up 365 total yards, 222 through the air. Joe Flacco and Mike Wallace torched the Raider secondary, connecting on three passes of more than 20 yards. A 52-yard pass from Flacco to Wallace set up the first Raven touchdown on their first possession. Trailing 7-0, Raider tight end Jared Cook fumbled on the ensuing possession and Jimmy Smith returned the fumble 47 yards to put the Raiders in 14-0 hole with over 11 minutes remaining in the first quarter. The Raiders marched 61 yards on 12 plays on their next possession, but had to settle for a Giorgio Tavecchio 32-yard field goal. The Ravens extended the lead on their next possession, going 75 yards on 15 plays before Javorius Allen plunged in from one yard out to extend the lead to 21-3 early in the second quarter. EJ Manuel would find Michael Crabtree on a 41-yard touchdown pass following a scramble, but the Ravens added a field goal before the half to move the score to 24-10. In the second half, the Raiders pulled within a touchdown following a Marshawn Lunch three-yard score. However, the Raider offense could muster no more as EJ Manuel was sacked three times in the game and was under constant pressure from the Ravens.

These samples were dried, extracted with chloroform-methanol mixtures, and the lipids chromatographed on silica gel plates in different solvent systems. After spraying with sulfuric acid and charring, lipids were quantified using a scanning densitometer. It was thus possible to determine lipid concentrations in 12 consecutive epidermal layers, extending 96 microns into the skin. The phospholipids that were characterized all decreased in concentration toward the surface, whereas the neutral lipids and ceramides all increased. Glucosylceramide and acylglucosylceramide reached a peak concentration in the stratum granulosum and then decreased in the surface layers. Cholesterol sulfate reached a maximum concentration in the deeper stratum corneum and then abruptly decreased in the surface layer.

A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence.

It is used on occasion by many ethnic minorities who adhere to the Islamic faith in China (mostly the Hui, but also the Dongxiang, and the Salar), and formerly by their Dungan descendants in Central Asia.

Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 220206 BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (13681644).\\n\\n- A mountain pass is a route through a mountain range or over a ridge.

Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign.

By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took a back seat to his official duties as a professor of chemistry.\\nOnly Rimsky-Korsakov actively pursued a full-time musical career, and he was under increasing fire from his fellow nationalists for much the same reason as Tchaikovsky had been. Like Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov had found that, for his own artistic growth to continue unabated, he had to study and master Western classical forms and techniques. Borodin called it \\"apostasy\\", adding, \\"Many are grieved at present by the fact that Korsakov has turned back, has thrown himself into a study of musical antiquity. I do not bemoan it. It is understandable....\\" Mussorgsky was harsher: \\"[T]he mighty kuchka had degenerated into soulless traitors.\\"Tchaikovsky's analysis of each of The Five was unsparing. While at least some of his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that all...\\n\\nGuess a valid title for it!","target":"Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and The Five","rationale":"The given text is about Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and The Five.\\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was a Russian composer whose works included symphonies, concertos, operas, ballets, chamber music and a choral setting of the Russian Orthodox Divine Liturgy.

According to Debrett's, it is always rude to pay more attention to a phone than the people around you, and they should always be put away when you're paying for something in a shop. They should be turned off in theatres, cinemas or any space where silence is required.\\nSmoking e-cigarettes at work\\nAs electronic cigarettes become more popular, questions about whether they are acceptable in the workplace are asked more often. According to Debrett's, they should never be used in a work environment. Smoking e-cigarettes at work shows that you're not focused on your work and may also have a bad influence on your workmates.\\nGiving up your seat on public transport\\nIn a recent university experiment only 20 per cent of London tube passengers are willing to give up their seat to people in need.

One manifestation of this involved women, who became more involved with music on a social level. Women were already engaged in professional roles as singers, and increased their presence in the amateur performers' scene, especially with keyboard music. Music publishers begin to print music that amateurs could understand and play. The majority of the works that were published were for keyboard, voice and keyboard, and chamber ensemble. After these initial genres were popularized, from the mid-century on, amateur groups sang choral music, which then became a new trend for publishers to capitalize on. The increasing study of the fine arts, as well as access to amateur-friendly published works, led to more people becoming interested in reading and discussing music. Music magazines, reviews, and critical works which suited amateurs as well as connoisseurs began to surface.","target":"Music publishers begin to print music that amateurs could understand and play","rationale":"The first sentence of the context talks about an increase in amateur musicians.

LXA and three of its isomers were prepared by total organic synthesis and assayed for activity with human NK cells. Dose-response studies showed that biologically derived LXA and synthetic LXA were equally effective in inhibiting NK cell cytotoxicity. 6S-LXA, with its 6S-OH group in an (S) configuration, proved to be approximately half as potent as LXA. In contrast, 6S-11-trans-LXA and 11-trans-LXA displayed virtually no inhibitory activities. The methyl esters of both LXA and 6S-LXA proved to be more potent than their corresponding free acids. Thus, LXA inhibition of NK cells displays clear-cut stereochemistry. In the absence of putative inhibitors, NK cells bind to their targets to form conjugates. This event is followed by polarization of the NK Golgi apparatus, which moves towards the plasma membrane that is in contact with the target cell. However, in the presence of either the methyl ester or free acid of LXA, the Golgi apparati of NK cells bound to their targets were randomly oriented. In contrast, neither 6S-11-trans-LXA nor the potent NK inhibitor prostaglandin E2 affected the polarization. Furthermore, although prostaglandin E2 resulted in a decrease in NK-target cell binding efficiency, LXA and its isomers failed to affect conjugate formation. Together these results indicate that LXA-induced inhibition of NK cytotoxicity does not act on NK cell binding but may block cytotoxicity by disrupting \\"signals\\" involved in the specific orientation of the Golgi. Thus, this latter event may appear to be important in cytotoxicity. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Lipoxin A-induced inhibition of human natural killer cell cytotoxicity: studies on stereospecificity of inhibition and mode of action. option2: A common mammalian plan of accessory optic system organization revealed in all primates.","target":"Lipoxin A-induced inhibition of human natural killer cell cytotoxicity: studies on stereospecificity of inhibition and mode of action","rationale":"The correct title for the abstract is option1, 'Lipoxin A-induced inhibition of human natural killer cell cytotoxicity: studies on stereospecificity of inhibition and mode of action'.

Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. \\n\\n- A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatmentknown as specialitiesor they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communitiesknown as general practice. Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines (such as anatomy and physiology) underlying diseases and their treatmentthe \\"science\\" of medicineand also a decent competence in its applied practicethe art or \\"craft\\" of medicine.\\n\\n- North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington.\\n\\n- Teesside is the name given to the conurbation in the north east of England around the urban centre of Middlesbrough that is also made up of the towns of Billingham, Redcar, Stockton-on-Tees, Thornaby and surrounding settlements near the River Tees. It was also the name of a local government district between 1968 and 1974the County Borough of Teesside. Teesside remains an important centre for heavy industry, although the number of people employed has declined. Traditional industries, primarily steelmaking (British Steel) and chemical manufacture (Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)), have been replaced to a large extent by high technology activities, science development and service sector roles.\\n\\n- Public health refers to \\"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human health through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.\\" It is concerned with threats to health based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). The dimensions of health can encompass \\"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,\\" as defined by the United Nations' World Health Organization.

Newcastle also houses Newcastle University, a member of the Russell Group, as well as Northumbria University.\\n\\n- Newcastle University (Officially, the University of Newcastle upon Tyne) is a public research university located in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North-East of England. The university can trace its origins to a School of Medicine and Surgery (later the College of Medicine), established in 1834, and to the College of Physical Science (later renamed Armstrong College), founded in 1871. These two colleges came to form one division of the federal University of Durham, with the Durham Colleges forming the other. The Newcastle colleges merged to form King's College in 1937. In 1963, following an Act of Parliament, King's College became the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.\\n\\n- Middlesbrough is a large industrial town on the south bank of the River Tees in North East England, founded in 1830.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.  There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath.

The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the church being \\"governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre\\" and established \\"its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler\\", in the words of historian Richard Huscroft. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome. These changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question.

Mark scoffs at his opponent and says that the only real way to make progress is to make the ozone layer even stronger, not hurt it.\\n\\nWhose proposal will allow less ultraviolet light through the atmosphere?\\n\\nHint: Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.","target":"Mark","rationale":"The UV radiation is a form of electromagnetic energy that comes from the sun. The ozone layer limits the amount of ultraviolet rays that reach earth’s surface, and thus protects living organisms from harmful effects caused by such radiations.

On the other hand, Mark opposes his opponent's idea about eliminating the Ozone Layer because he thinks we need an even stronger protection against those dangerous solar radiations so what would happen if scientist made an effort on increasing its strength?

Furthermore, scientists studying the two cells have recorded that cell X is more metabolically active than cell Z.\\n\\nHint: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .","target":"smaller","rationale":"As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area.

Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted.

By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, reflecting a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career brought them to the attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could \\"have hardly been more supportive\\". Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, \\"their master piece to date\\", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and atmospherics without resorting to glamorisation. Melody Maker's Colin Irwin said it was \\"incredibly exciting and utterly compelling\\".  A dissenter was Neil McCormick of Irish fortnightly Hot Press, who dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk and wondered if the album was \\"meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music.\\"Later, Record Collector described the album as a \\"taut, twitchy and ominous masterclass in DIY post-punk\\", and singled out Smith's lyrics for praise. The Quietus, in 2009, wrote of the album as \\"arguably ...

In 1965, a more extensive excavation was carried out, again under the direction of Van Loon. Between 1971 and 1974, work on the site was resumed by a team of the French Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) directed by Jacques Cauvin. All excavations were part of the larger international – and eventually UNESCO-coordinated – effort to investigate as many archaeological sites as possible in the area that would be flooded by Lake Assad, the reservoir of the Tabqa Dam, which was being built at that time. The filling of Lake Assad eventually led to the flooding of Mureybet in 1976. Although the site is now submerged and no longer accessible, the material that has been retrieved during the excavations continues to generate new research.

Hair graying, a typical sign of aging in mammals, is caused by the incomplete maintenance of melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) with age. Here, we report that irreparable DNA damage, as caused by ionizing radiation, abrogates renewal of MSCs in mice. Surprisingly, the DNA-damage response triggers MSC differentiation into mature melanocytes in the niche, rather than inducing their apoptosis or senescence. The resulting MSC depletion leads to irreversible hair graying. Furthermore, deficiency of Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a central transducer kinase of the DNA-damage response, sensitizes MSCs to ectopic differentiation, demonstrating that the kinase protects MSCs from their premature differentiation by functioning as a \\"stemness checkpoint\\" to maintain the stem cell quality and quantity..

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.\\n\\n- Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.\\n\\n- The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself.

Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth.\\nApproximations employed.\\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.\\n\\n- The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica.

The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.\\n\\n- A World Heritage Site is a landmark which has been officially recognized by the United Nations, specifically by UNESCO. Sites are selected on the basis of having cultural, historical, scientific or some other form of significance, and they are legally protected by international treaties. UNESCO regards these sites as being important to the collective interests of humanity.\\n\\n- The Southwest National Park is a national park located in the south-west of Tasmania, Australia. The park is Tasmania's largest and forms part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.\\n\\n- The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.\\n\\n- The Subantarctic is a region in the southern hemisphere, located immediately north of the Antarctic region. This translates roughly to a latitude of between 46°  60° south of the Equator. The subantarctic region includes many islands in the southern parts of the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, especially those situated north of the Antarctic Convergence. Subantarctic glaciers are, by definition, located on islands within the subantarctic region.

Analysis of about 1500 in vitro translation products on giant two-dimensional gels revealed rapid hormonal influences on only 7 mRNAs, 6 whose translation products have mol wt and pIs identical to those proteins whose synthesis has been found to be increased after the addition of glucocorticoids to thymus cells. The additional mRNA codes for glucocortin, whose induction in thymus as well as other target cells has been reported. mRNA inductions for proteins 1, 2, and 1N are detectable 15-30 min after the addition of dexamethasone to isolated thymus cells and continue to increase until 2 h, whereas the mRNAs for proteins 4 and 5 are not increased until after 1 h. The mRNA for protein 3 is elevated by 1 h, but attempts to quantitate the change at earlier times have failed because this protein focuses poorly. The parallel between these in vitro translation results and the increased synthesis of individual proteins seen in whole cells demonstrates that increased mRNA levels underlie the cellular changes. Other hormones, such as estradiol, testosterone, and T3, at 10(-6) M and deoxycorticosterone at 10(-8) M do not induce these messages. Partial inductions of 1 and 2, but not 1N, are seen with deoxycorticosterone at 10(-6) M, consistent with its classification as a partial glucocorticoid agonist. Cycloheximide does not block the rise in mRNA for the most rapid inductions, 1, 2, and 1N. The results indicate that dexamethasone rapidly and specifically induces 6 thymus cell mRNAs in addition to the one coding for glucocortin. The cycloheximide results suggest that at least 3 of these represent primary steroid hormone responses.","target":"Glucocorticoid-induced messenger ribonucleic acids in rat thymic lymphocytes: rapid primary effects specific for glucocorticoids","rationale":"The title should capture the main finding of the paper, which is that glucocorticoid hormone rapidly and specifically induces several mRNAs in thymus cells.

After being incorporated into the Sui dynasty, its economic richness was used for the Sui dynasty's ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into Korea and Vietnam. The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay), and from Suzhou, and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country.

The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.\\nThe positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture.

The 15th century saw the emergence of Sikhism. In the 16th century, Mughals came from Central Asia and gradually covered most of India.

The band currently consists of Luke Pritchard (vocals/rhythm guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar/synth), Alexis Nunez (drums), and Peter Denton (bass guitar). The original bassist was Max Rafferty, and the founding drummer was Paul Garred. The lineup of the band remained constant until the departure of Rafferty in 2008.\\n\\nAfter they had signed to Virgin Records, the Kooks were reluctant to record an album straight away, stating a desire to focus more on their live performances and songwriting. The band has said embarking on their first live tour instead of recording an album initially helped them develop their style and sound. As Pritchard claimed, \\"We didn't sit down with a blueprint. We just naturally developed and we didn't try to shape or mould ourselves to anything.\\" As a result, they went into the studio with hundreds of songs from a variety of genres, and it took an \\"incredible amount of patience\\" from producer Tony Hoffer to shape the content into what would become the record.  Following their first tour supporting the Thrills, the Kooks recorded their debut album, Inside In/Inside Out, at Konk studios in London in 2005. Though media attention was dominated by the release of the Arctic Monkeys debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not on the same day, Inside In/Inside Out recorded first week sales of 19,098. Later, speaking to NME, Pritchard would thank the Arctic Monkeys for \\"shielding\\" The Kooks from the press' scrutiny. \\"God bless the Arctic Monkeys because if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have been so shielded. We were so overshadowed by the success [of Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not] because it was so monster and we crept in behind everybody's back.\\" Entering the UK Albums Chart at number nine, it would eventually peak at number 2 for two weeks. Singles \\"Eddie's Gun\\", \\"Sofa Song\\", \\"You Don't Love Me\\", \\"Naive\\", \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\" and \\"Ooh La\\" achieved chart success in the UK and Europe, while \\"Naive\\" and \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\" put The Kooks in the top ten for the first time.  Kev Kharas, in his review for Drowned in Sound, viewed the Kooks as \\"a less irreverent and more melodic Art Brut, swapping that band's caustic wit for a far nicer type of honesty.\\" Kharas also noted traces of \\"emo\\" in the band's style. AllMusic's Tim Sendra noted that the band's direction was \\"heavily indebted to classic rock\\", in particular Thin Lizzy and the Dexys, ultimately though Sendra felt \\"the band sounds like the Kooks and no one else\\". Calling the Kooks \\"an important reminder that there are just as many mediocre bands in the UK as there are in the United States\\" reviewer Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone claimed the album was \\"utterly forgettable, shoddily produced retro rock that at its worst sounds like a Brighton-accented version of the Spin Doctors\\". Brian Belardi of Prefix gave a positive review, describing Inside In/Inside Out as \\"An almost-perfect blend of '60s-style Britpop, '90s-style Britpop, and the post-punk of the new millennium\\".  The album went on to be certified quadruple platinum in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) within a year and certified platinum across Europe by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The success of their debut album brought the band into mainstream media attention, winning the award for best UK and Ireland act at the MTV Awards in 2006 and picking up a Brit Awards nomination for \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\", in 2007.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"The Kooks","rationale":"The context describes the history of, and some facts about a music band.

In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangzê was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \\"Head of British Mission Lhasa\\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began.

While the specific definition has changed over time, modern usage refers to (a) a typically non-realistic or semi-realistic artistic style of drawing or painting, (b) an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor, or (c) a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. An artist who creates cartoons is called a cartoonist.\\n\\n- A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising. Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging.\\n\\n- A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics.\\nThere were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'movement' with the subject 'kurt westergaard'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- caricature\\n - comic","target":"caricature","rationale":"The cartoon is the object entity that has a relation of ‘movement’ with the subject, which is kurt westergaard. A caricature describes an image or series of images intended for satire, humor and sometimes political commentary. Since this particular cartoon had caused strong reactions from Muslims worldwide including Western countries and their creator received death threats as well as assassination attempts we can infer that it was indeed meant to be satirical in nature. Therefore, Caricature captures both movement and intent best out of all other options given above so its answer"},{"source":"Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

It was the coldest conditions that Miami had ever played in. Miami scored first on the opening drive with a touchdown by WR Ted Ginn, Jr.. Despite trailing 10-0 early in the game, Tyler Thigpen led the Chiefs to a 28-24 lead by halftime. The Chiefs failed to score a touchdown in the second half of the game, only managing a field goal by Connor Barth. The Dolphins broke a 31-31 tie with a touchdown by TE Anthony Fasano with 4:08 remaining in the game. With just over a minute remaining, Chiefs LB Demorrio Williams forced and recovered a fumble to give the Chiefs another chance to tie the game. A failed drive capped off by Thigpen's third interception helped Miami run out the clock. Thigpen threw a career best 320&#160;yards with two touchdowns, but also threw three interceptions. TE Tony Gonzalez became the first Chiefs player and first NFL tight end to record four 1,000&#160;yard receiving seasons.

Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875.\\nThe company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block.

He is best known for his time in WWE, where he won the WWE Tag Team Championship once with Santino Marella. He is trained in freestyle wrestling, rugby, football, sambo, kickboxing, judo, jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts. Prudius has also worked as a stage and screen actor, notably having a small role in Spike Lee's 25th Hour., and a walk-on role in the second season of the HBO series The Wire.\\n\\nOn the April 4, 2008 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov made his official WWE debut as a villain, with the unique quirk of having no entrance music and no Titantron video - his \\"entrance\\" consisted of complete darkness except for a solitary spotlight following him to the ring. He defeated Matt Bentley in his first match, and over the following weeks, Kozlov would go on to easily win several matches, first against local talent and then established names including Colin Delaney, Funaki, Nunzio, Shannon Moore, Jimmy Wang Yang, Jamie Noble, and Domino. On the July 11 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov debuted an entrance theme and Titantron video as he defeated Stevie Richards.  In the following weeks, as Kozlov continued to easily win matches, he began demanding \\"better competition\\". On the September 12 episode of SmackDown, he started to seek that competition, attacking Jeff Hardy. Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose feud between the three of them over the WWE Championship. On the November 7 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE title at Survivor Series after defeating The Undertaker by disqualification after he was attacked by Jeff Hardy. The match was originally intended to include Kozlov, Jeff Hardy, and Triple H, although Hardy was removed due to a storyline injury. The result of this was the addition of Edge to the match while it was in progress, and ultimately Edge would go on to pin Triple H and win the title.  Continuing his pursuit of the WWE Championship, Kozlov competed in and was unsuccessful in winning a Beat the Clock Challenge match against ECW Champion Matt Hardy for another title shot. This led to the two meeting at Armageddon, where Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating Hardy in a non-title match. Kozlov competed in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, entering as the sixth participant, but was eliminated by Triple H after eliminating The Great Khali, Carlito, and Montel Vontavious Porter. He then qualified to be part of the No Way Out Elimination Chamber match, where he was pinned for the first time after receiving a Last Ride from The Undertaker, though he still remained unpinned in one-on-one competition. Kozlov's undefeated streak in televised singles competition ended on the March 2, 2009 episode of Raw, in which he was defeated by Shawn Michaels; this match was for the opportunity to face The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXV. His first televised singles loss on SmackDown came against The Undertaker himself on March 13.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Vladimir Kozlov","rationale":"The text is about a professional wrestler named \\"Vladimir Kozlov\\", which makes him the entity."},{"source":"Given a paragraph about cooking, and a set of conversational questions and answers about the paragraph, say whether the passage contains sufficient information to answer the follow-up question.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring).

In this study, we focused on one such self-attention network model, namely BERT, which has performed well in terms of stacking layers across diverse language-understanding benchmarks. However, in many downstream tasks, information between layers is ignored by BERT for fine-tuning. In addition, although self-attention networks are well-known for their ability to capture global dependencies, room for improvement remains in terms of emphasizing the importance of local contexts. In light of these advantages and disadvantages, this paper proposes SesameBERT, a generalized fine-tuning method that (1) enables the extraction of global information among all layers through Squeeze and Excitation and (2) enriches local information by capturing neighboring contexts via Gaussian blurring. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in the HANS dataset, which is used to determine whether models have adopted shallow heuristics instead of learning underlying generalizations. The experiments revealed that SesameBERT outperformed BERT with respect to GLUE benchmark and the HANS evaluation set.","target":"We proposed SesameBERT, a generalized fine-tuning method that enables the extraction of global information among all layers through Squeeze and Excitation and enriches local information by capturing neighboring contexts via Gaussian blurring","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe proposed SesameBERT, a generalized fine-tuning method that enables the extraction of global information among all layers through Squeeze and Excitation and enriches local information by capturing neighboring contexts via Gaussian blurring."},{"source":"What is the answer to this question? what episode does sasuke and itachi fight kabuto?","target":"Sibling Tag Team","rationale":"The answer is based on the fact that Sasuke and Itachi fight Kabuto in an episode titled \\"Sibling Tag Team\\" during which they team up against their enemy. \\nThis information can be verified through various credible sources such as Wikipedia.org, http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kabuto_Yakushi#Part_II:_.22Five_Kage_.E2.80.93_Summit_.21%22 .\\nTherefore, the answer should be \\"Sibling Tag Team\\"."},{"source":"Sheila split open and the air was filled with gumballs.

Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today.  Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta.  This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459).

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\".\\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall.\\nWood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music.

Further, proponents of the necessity of the personal apostolic succession of bishops within the Church point to the universal practice of the undivided early Church (up to AD 431), before being divided into the Church of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. Christians of the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Old Catholic, Anglican, Moravian, and Scandinavian Lutheran traditions maintain that 'a bishop cannot have regular or valid orders unless he has been consecrated in this apostolic succession.'

The first stage, known as sensitization, usually starts in childhood, and is marked by the child's becoming aware of same-sex attractions. The second stage, identity confusion, tends to occur a few years later. In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners. In the third stage of identity assumption, which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a self-definition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. In the final stage, known as commitment, the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle. Therefore, this model estimates that the process of coming out begins in childhood, and continues through the early to mid 20s. This model has been contested, and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years.\\n\\nTitle:","target":"Adolescence","rationale":"The article is mainly concerned with the development of homosexual sexual identity.

Born in Leicester and of Nigerian descent, he was capped four times for England. Dublin started his career as a centre-back with Norwich City, but made his name at Cambridge United as a centre-forward. He had spells with Norwich City, Cambridge United, Manchester United, Coventry City, Millwall, Aston Villa, Leicester City and Celtic.\\n\\nDublin was controversially excluded from the England 1998 FIFA World Cup squad, despite being the Premier League's joint top-scorer in the 1997-98 season, alongside Michael Owen and Chris Sutton. However, his exploits at club level were still attracting significant attention and in the autumn of 1998, he chose to move to Aston Villa for PS5.75 million. In his first four games for the club, he would score 7 goals including a memorable hat-trick against Southampton in only his second game for the Villans. As a result, he is one of only six players to score in the first four consecutive games for a Premier League club.  In December 1999, whilst playing for Aston Villa against Sheffield Wednesday, he sustained a life-threatening broken neck, as a result of which he permanently has a titanium plate holding three neck vertebrae together. Just days before suffering this injury, it was reported in the News of the World that Dublin would soon be sold by Aston Villa for a fee of around PS6million as the club looked to finance a fall in its share value as a result of manager John Gregory's heavy expenditure on players.  Incredibly, the injury did not end Dublin's career and he was back in action three months later.  In April 2000, a week after returning to the team, he helped Aston Villa reach their first FA Cup final in 43 years, which they lost 1-0 against Chelsea, scoring a penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Bolton Wanderers. Having regained his fitness, Dublin remained on the Villa Park payroll until 2002.  Faced with competition for a first team place by Juan Pablo Angel and Peter Crouch, Dublin spent several weeks on loan at First Division Millwall. In his time there, he scored two goals, against Stockport County, and Grimsby Town in five league matches to help them into the play-offs where despite Dublin's goal in the first leg of the semi final, Millwall lost to Birmingham City 2-1 on aggregate. Returning to Villa, he found himself again a first choice striker, partnering Darius Vassell up front.

Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires. \\nQuestion: Electricity is the continuous flow of the particles found in the outer most particle of what? \\nIs the correct answer Electrons?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The correct answer is Yes.\\nIn the question, it says \\"Electric current\\" (electricity) flows through wires in which electrons move and change directions of flow continuously.

Passage 1:The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work. A concept album, its themes explore conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating health of founding member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. The group used recording techniques such as multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew, as well as philosophical quotations, were also used. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry, who appears on \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\". The sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson, following keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \\"simple and bold\\" design, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: \\"Money\\" and \\"Us and Them\\".\\n Passage 2:Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana as an only child, he was raised on his grandfather's farm which influenced his affinity for nature and the rural life of Louisiana. His father influenced his decision to become an artist. Elemore Morgan Sr., a full-time photographer, had also worked and farmed with Louisiana architect A. Hays Town. At Louisiana State University and studied art under the tutelage of Caroline Durieux, Ralston Crawford and David LeDoux. For two years he served in the U.S. Air Force as a supply officer during the Korean War. With the help of the GI Bill, Morgan studied art at The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at the University of Oxford in England. In 1957 he returned to Louisiana began working in Lafayette with longtime friend and architect Neil Nehrbass. He served as an associate professor from 1965 to 1998 at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then named the University of Southwestern Louisiana).\\n Passage 3:He started his career with Shrewsbury Town in 1988, and after being voted onto the PFA Team of the Year, moved on to Manchester City for £500,000 in October 1993.

He joined Leyton Orient for £65,000 in March 1997, where he stayed for four years, interrupted by short spells at Wrexham (on loan) and Port Vale. He played for Luton Town between July 2001 and 2003 following a £65,000 transfer, later dropping into non-league football with Harlow Town, Braintree Town, Brentwood Town, and Maldon Town.

This means that molecules have more kinetic energy and move faster at higher temperatures. The reason Gwen's customers feel their ears pop is because air pressure in the sauna is lower than outside of it and there are fewer collisions between gas particles and the walls of her room when they leave (the wall doesn't experience as much force). If she lowers the temperature to 100 K then air molecules will travel slower with less kinetic energy, leading to an increase in pressure inside but not outside of her sauna.

On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo.

The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \\"river\\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters.

Prior to entering politics, Khan played international cricket for two decades in the late twentieth century. Khan was born to a Pashtun family in Lahore, Punjab, in 1952 and educated at Aitchison, Worcester, and later at Keble College, Oxford.\\n\\nAt the height of his career, in 1982, the thirty-year-old Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad. As a captain, Khan played 48 Test matches, out of which 14 were won by Pakistan, 8 lost and the rest of 26 were drawn. He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie.  In the team's second match, Khan led them to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord's. Khan's first year as captain was the peak of his legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder. He recorded the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981-1982. He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat. Later the same year, he put up a highly acknowledged performance in a home series against the formidable Indian team by taking 40 wickets in six Tests at an average of 13.95. By the end of this series in 1982-1983, Khan had taken 88 wickets in 13 Test matches over a period of one year as captain. This same Test series against India, however, also resulted in a stress fracture in his shin that kept him out of cricket for more than two years. An experimental treatment funded by the Pakistani government helped him recover by the end of 1984 and he made a successful comeback to international cricket in the latter part of the 1984-1985 season.  In India in 1987, Khan led Pakistan in its first-ever Test series win and this was followed by Pakistan's first series victory in England during the same year. During the 1980s, his team also recorded three creditable draws against the West Indies. India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 World Cup, but neither ventured beyond the semi-finals. Khan retired from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. In 1988, he was asked to return to the captaincy by the president of Pakistan, General Zia-Ul-Haq, and on 18 January, he announced his decision to rejoin the team. Soon after returning to the captaincy, Khan led Pakistan to another winning tour in the West Indies, which he has recounted as \\"the last time I really bowled well\\". He was declared Man of the Series against West Indies in 1988 when he took 23 wickets in 3 Tests. Khan's career-high as a captain and cricketer came when he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Playing with a brittle batting line-up, Khan promoted himself as a batsman to play in the top order along with Javed Miandad, but his contribution as a bowler was minimal. At the age of 39, Khan took the winning last wicket himself.\\n\\nWhat was he a captain of?","target":"Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad.","rationale":"The answer is \\"Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad\\" because the context states that:\\nAt the height of his career, in 1982, Khan took over the captaincy of Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad."},{"source":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\\nArticle: John wanted to buy some new clothes, so he went to a shop.

In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London.
