At the time of the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'\\"In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry. Fanning was called upon by film-maker Gregor Jordan in 2003 to perform the folk song \\"Moreton Bay\\" (named after the bay of the same name in the Brisbane area) and his own original composition \\"Shelter for My Soul\\" in Jordan's film Ned Kelly.

Kant argues that the human mind creates the structure of human experience, that reason is the source of morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that the world as it is \\"in-itself\\" is independent of humanity's concepts of it. Kant took himself to have effected a \\"Copernican revolution\\" in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolves around the earth.\\n\\nImmanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 in Konigsberg, Prussia (since 1946 the city of Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). His mother, Anna Regina Reuter (1697-1737), was also born in Konigsberg to a father from Nuremberg. (Her name is sometimes erroneously given as Anna Regina Porter.) His father, Johann Georg Kant (1682-1746), was a German harness maker from Memel, at the time Prussia's most northeastern city (now Klaipeda, Lithuania). Immanuel Kant believed that his paternal grandfather Hans Kant was of Scottish origin. While scholars of Kant's life long accepted the claim, there is no evidence that Kant's paternal line was Scottish; it is more likely that the Kants got their name from the village of Kantwaggen (today part of Priekule) and were of Curonian origin. Kant was the fourth of nine children (four of them reached adulthood). Baptized 'Emanuel', he changed his name to 'Immanuel' after learning Hebrew.  Young Kant was a solid, albeit unspectacular, student. Kant was born into a Prussian German family of Lutheran Protestant faith in East Prussia. He was brought up in a Pietist household that stressed religious devotion, humility, and a literal interpretation of the Bible. His education was strict, punitive and disciplinary, and focused on Latin and religious instruction over mathematics and science. Kant maintained a belief in Christianity, in his work Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals he reveals a belief in human immortality as the necessary condition of our continued approach to the highest good possible. However, as Kant was skeptical about some of the arguments used prior to him in defence of Theism and maintained that human understanding is limited and can never attain knowledge about God or the soul, various commentators have labelled him a philosophical agnostic.  Common myths about Kant's personal mannerisms are listed, explained, and refuted in Goldthwait's introduction to his translation of Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime. It is often held that Kant lived a very strict and disciplined life, leading to an oft-repeated story that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. He never married, but seemed to have a rewarding social life -- he was a popular teacher and a modestly successful author even before starting on his major philosophical works. He had a circle of friends whom he frequently met, among them Joseph Green, an English merchant in Konigsberg.  A common myth is that Kant never traveled more than 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Konigsberg his whole life. In fact, between 1750 and 1754 he worked as a tutor (Hauslehrer) in Judtschen (now Veselovka, Russia, approximately 20 km) and in Gross-Arnsdorf (now Jarnoltowo near Morag (German: Mohrungen), Poland, approximately 145 km).\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Immanuel Kant","rationale":"The context is about the life, career and works of Immanuel Kant.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles.\\nIt is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.\\nTeasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse.

Defensive pessimism is a strategy used to manage fear, anxiety and worry. Defensive pessimists prepare for the things by setting low outcomes for themselves. They carefully consider everything that may go wrong and plan for ways to handle these problems. And this gives them a sense of control.

With Dave, a lot of it is psychological. I'll guide him in, and coerce and nurture him, and when the time is right I suppose I'll even shout at him again.\\" When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, \\"A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well.\\" In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had \\"eight tracks\\" ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress.Quaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23 June 2010, aged 66. Two days after the bassist's death, Dave Davies posted a statement on his message board expressing deep sorrow over the passing of his former band mate and stating that Quaife \\"was never really given the credit he deserved for his contribution and involvement [sic] [with The Kinks]\\". Ray Davies dedicated his performance of 27 June at the Glastonbury Festival to Quaife and performed several Quaife-era Kinks songs in tribute to him. Davies told the crowd, \\"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him.\\"In separate interviews early in 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, \\"There's nothing in the pipeline yet, but ... we'll see. It's possible.\\" Each has said that any reunion would be dependent on the other. According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans.

Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach.

Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477. \\n\\nDecide whether \\"Egypt\\" is a valid answer to the following question: Where is the army who over run most of Spain form? .\\nAnswer yes or no.","target":"No","rationale":"The context of this passage discusses the history of Madrid, Spain.

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal.

This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.

His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual.

Siam very much remained a thorn to the stability of Burmese peripheral regions. In the following years, Siam continued to provide support to Mon rebels in the south who raised a major rebellion in 1762 as well as those in Lan Na in the north . The only lasting territorial gain the Burmese achieved was the upper Tenasserim coast, on which they previously had only a nominal claim.  Although the Siamese troops no longer openly intruded the border, the Mon rebels continued to operate from the Siamese territory. In 1764, the Mon governor of Tavoy, who was made governor by Alaungpaya only four years earlier, revolted until it was put down in November 1764. Likewise, the instabilities in Lan Na resumed soon after the Burmese army left in February 1764, forcing the army to return again later in the year.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat.

Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.","target":"sample B","rationale":"The paragraph states that cellular respiration is the conversion of glucose into energy in the presence of oxygen, so an organism without any respiration rate will not be able to produce usable energy.

The opera was first performed by the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences.\\nBizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years.

According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula.

The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife.

Karadžić standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, and Gaj and Daničić standardized the Croatian Latin alphabet, on the basis of vernacular speech phonemes and the principle of phonological spelling.

Since its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to a number of compilations and extended plays. Anal Cunt disbanded in 2011 after the group's founder and frontman, Seth Putnam, died of a suspected heart attack.\\nContext: In April 2010, Putnam announced that the new album was almost completed. The album was delayed due to Josh Martin being in jail (for a third time). The lead guitar tracks were recorded when he was released. On May 11, 2010, Putnam announced that the band decided to split the new recording into two albums. The \\"cock rock songs\\" would be released on an album called Fuckin' A in a style similar to that of Motley Crue's debut Too Fast for Love, and the noisegrind songs would be released on an album called Wearing Out Our Welcome, which would also feature backing vocals from members of The Raunchous Brothers, Vaginal Jesus, and Mudoven. On June 22, 2010, Putnam completed Fuckin' A. The songs \\"Fuck Yeah\\" and \\"Cranking My Band's Demo on a Box at the Beach\\" were released on Myspace Music. On June 24, 2010, Seth Putnam announced on the Anal Cunt Myspace blog that guitarist Josh Martin \\"is out of A.C.\\". Putnam continued by stating that the band would play and record as a two-piece outfit. Fuckin' A was released on January 11, 2011. At the same time, it was announced that Josh Martin was once again back in Anal Cunt, after only two shows performed as a two-piece. In April 2011 Anal Cunt embarked on what would be their final tour. The last show was on April 30, 2011, in Cleveland.  On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder Seth Putnam died of a suspected heart attack, seemingly ending the band.  A compilation CD of obscure Anal Cunt releases was announced in 2009 and was planned to be released by Wicked Sick Records (Seth Putnam's label). In October 2011 it was announced to be a two-CD set entitled The Old Testament. It is a re-release of The Early Years 1988-1991 with a new cover, liner notes penned by Putnam, the band's first demo (which was never before heard by anyone outside Anal Cunt or two girls that visited Putnam's house and were in the room when the recording was made), and tracks from Anal Cunt's final rehearsal session in 1991.

The median age was 27.6 as of 2016. The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361.1 million people.

Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels (210×10^3 m3) per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.\\n\\nWhy do refineries like to buy bitumen instead of synthetic oil?","target":"cost is lower","rationale":"The context provides information about the chemical composition of bitumen and its ease of processing in oil refineries.

Tom tilled his land, while Brad applied the no-till gardening method.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich farmer had a soil that took longer to warm in spring?\\n\\nHint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.","target":"Brad","rationale":"In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates.\\nSo the answer is Brad"},{"source":"Given the Target and Argument texts detect the stance that the argument has towards the topic.

Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20]","target":"2019","rationale":"In 2018, the subtropical ridge was in a position that caused heavy rains. In 2019, on the other hand, it did not have enough strength to cause rain. This means that between these 2 years is when the subtropical ridge moved southwards and became weaker than before (suppressed). Hence 2019 was an extremely dry year with too little rainfall for normal monsoon conditions across SW USA .\\nSo you can answer  “2019” as correct option"},{"source":"Background: Matthew Boulton  (; 3 September 1728 - 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt. In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment.\\nContext: Boulton was widely involved in civic activities in Birmingham. His friend Dr John Ash had long sought to build a hospital in the town. A great fan of the music of Handel, Boulton conceived of the idea to hold a music festival in Birmingham to raise funds for the hospital. The festival took place in September 1768, the first of a series stretching well into the twentieth century. The hospital opened in 1779. Boulton also helped build the General Dispensary, where outpatient treatment could be obtained. A firm supporter of the Dispensary, he served as treasurer, and wrote, \\"If the funds of the institution are not sufficient for its support, I will make up the deficiency.\\" The Dispensary soon outgrew its original quarters, and a new building in Temple Row was opened in 1808, shortly before Boulton's death.  Boulton helped found the New Street Theatre in 1774, and later wrote that having a theatre encouraged well-to-do visitors to come to Birmingham, and to spend more money than they would have otherwise. Boulton attempted to have the theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent, entitled to present serious drama; he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807. He also supported Birmingham's Oratorio Choral Society, and collaborated with button maker and amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore to put on a series of private concerts in 1799. He maintained a pew at St Paul's Church, Birmingham, a centre of musical excellence. When performances of the Messiah were organised at Westminster Abbey in 1784 in the (incorrect) belief it was the centennial of Handel's birth and the (correct) belief that it was the 25th anniversary of his death, Boulton attended and wrote, \\"I scarcely know which was grandest, the sounds or the scene. Both was transcendibly fine that it is not in my power of words to describe. In the grand Halleluja my soul almost ascended from my body.\\"  Concerned about the level of crime in Birmingham, Boulton complained, \\"The streets are infested from Noon Day to midnight with prostitutes.\\" In an era prior to the establishment of the police, Boulton served on a committee to organise volunteers to patrol the streets at night and reduce crime. He supported the local militia, providing money for weapons. In 1794 he was elected High Sheriff of Staffordshire, his county of residence.  Besides seeking to improve local life, Boulton took an interest in world affairs. Initially sympathetic to the cause of the rebellious American colonists, Boulton changed his view once he realised that an independent America might be a threat to British trade, and in 1775 organised a petition urging the government to take a hard line with the Americans--though when the revolution proved successful, he resumed trade with the former colonies. He was more sympathetic to the cause of the French Revolution, believing it justified, though he expressed his horror at the bloody excesses of the Revolutionary government. When war with France broke out, he paid for weapons for a company of volunteers, sworn to resist any French invasion.\\nQuestion: Did he ever volunteer any of his wealth for the community work?. Whats the answer?","target":"\\"If the funds of the institution are not sufficient for its support, I will make up the deficiency.","rationale":"The context mentions that Mr Boulton was involved in various social activities and supported the General Dispensary, where he served as treasurer. \\nHe also said: \\"If the funds of the institution are not sufficient for its support, I will make up the deficiency.\\""},{"source":"In this task you are given a disfluent question, a proper question and a context.

Greg remarks that for too long the ozone layer has been a hindrance to progress and that scientists need to work to eliminate it. Mark scoffs at his opponent and says that the only real way to make progress is to make the ozone layer even stronger, not hurt it.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Whose proposal will allow less ultraviolet light through the atmosphere?","target":"Mark","rationale":"The ozone layer partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light, so it is possible to infer that eliminating this would allow more UV rays through.

Passage:After the success of Walt Disney Productions' first feature-length animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), filmmaker Walt Disney himself made several attempts to adapt the fairy tale \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont into one of the studio's earliest animated feature films during the 1930s and 1950s. However, the project was continuously abandoned due to the fairy tale's \\"static\\" plot and main characters. The filmmaker was also concerned about the \\"unnecessary intensity\\" required to depict Belle's imprisonment. Inspired by the unprecedented success of The Little Mermaid (1989), Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg green-lit another attempt at adapting \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" under the direction of Richard Purdum. However, Katzenberg did not approve of Purdum's dark, somber version of the fairy tale, and ultimately ordered that it be restarted from scratch in favor of creating a Broadway-style musical film starring a strong heroine, more similar to The Little Mermaid. Opting instead for a \\"feminist twist\\" on the original story, largely in response to critics' negative reception to Ariel regarding her pursuit of Eric being her overall character, Katzenberg hired television writer Linda Woolverton, who had never written an animated film before, to write the film's screenplay.\\n Links: a.

Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and isolated mountains, the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75 years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.Wind can also cause plants damage through sand abrasion.

The Eagles struggled in the first half as the offensive line struggled to protect Sam Bradford and the defense gave up big plays in the first half. And after DeMarco Murray's first run went for 30 yards, he only added 6 yards to it for the rest of the game. The defense would hold the Redskins from a TD on the first 2 drives. Kirk Cousins and the Redskins were able to get the ball moving in the first half. New Eagles kicker Caleb Sturgis, who replaced an injured Cody Parkey, missed a short field goal at the end of the first half and an extra point at the beginning of the second half. The Eagles were able to get the chains moving in the third quarter. Touchdowns by veterans Riley Cooper and Brent Celek gave the Eagles a tie, but Washington took the lead back. At the end of the third quarter, Brandon Graham forced a fumble on Jordan Reed, which was recovered by rookie Jordan Hicks. The Eagles would score on the corresponding drive with a Miles Austin touchdown. However, the Eagles made costly mistakes on 3rd down and had to settle for a punt with 5 minutes left in the game. The Redskins then drove down the field and Pierre Gar&#231;on scored the game-winning touchdown. The Eagles attempted to tie or win the game with only 26 seconds left, but the Redskins defense held. The offensive line failed to protect Bradford again and gave up another 2 sacks. With the loss, the Eagles dropped to 1-3 and last place in the NFC East.

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.\\n\\n- Sonic Youth was an American rock band from New York City, formed in 1981.

In their early career Sonic Youth were associated with the no wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound.\\n\\n- The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand.

He is told of his life of sin and the fact that he is doomed to spend eternity at a section called Level 4. However, he is given a chance to save himself by convincing three other people to sell their souls in exchange for his. Max returns to Earth and begins his frantic quest with two months (ending on May 15) to complete his mission. Barney appears frequently throughout the movie to check up on Max's progress as well as both taunt and persuade him to carry out the plans. A running joke is that nobody, except Max, can see or hear Barney.In addition to being temporarily alive, Max soon learns that he casts no reflection when he looks into any mirror. Barney tells Max that by a signed contract his soul belongs to him unless he completes his mission.

Approach The World Health Organization (WHO) package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings was adopted in seven villages throughout Samoa in 2015. The National Steering Committee Members designed and implemented a screening process, and local facilitators and health-care workers collected health and lifestyle data. The WHO/International Society of Hypertension risk assessment was used on villagers older than 40 years to identify people at high risk of noncommunicable disease.    Local setting Samoa is a small island developing state with increasing morbidity and mortality due to noncommunicable diseases. A national representative survey indicated that 50.1% (595/1188) of the Samoan adult population is at high risk of such diseases. High numbers of noncommunicable diseases are undiagnosed or untreated, because of shortage of health-care staff and lack of awareness of risk factors.    Relevant changes The teams collected data from 2234 adults. For people older than 40 years, 6.7% (54/804) were identified as being at high-risk and were encouraged to seek treatment or manage risk factors. Community members developed an awareness programme to improve understanding of lifestyle risk factors.    Lessons learnt Engaging community members was crucial in conducting a successful screening campaign. By identifying those villagers at high risk of developing noncommunicable diseases, early intervention was possible. Education improved awareness of the symptom-free nature of early-stage noncommunicable diseases.","target":"False","rationale":"Sometimes, it's not clear whether a structured or unstructured abstract is better for the article.

Bonding in metallic solids is quite different from the bonding in the other kinds of solids we have discussed. Because all the atoms are the same, there can be no ionic bonding, yet metals always contain too few electrons or valence orbitals to form covalent bonds with each of their neighbors.

Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.\\n\\nEven though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]\\n\\nTwo islands of identical size with similar ecosystems experienced different destinies.

These new cigarette health warnings contains nine different warnings that will increase awareness of the specific health risks associated with smoking, such as death, addiction, lung disease, cancer, stroke and heart disease. These warnings include:\\n\\nParagraph: Dahlia has smoked cigarettes every day for many years. Dahlia's daughter, Samantha, has never smoked a cigarette in her life. Besides this difference, Dahlia and Samantha have similar activity levels and eat a similar diet.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who has a lower risk of developing heart disease?","target":"Samantha","rationale":"According to the paragraph, Dahlia and Samantha have similar activity levels and eat a similar diet. The only difference between them is that Dahlia has smoked cigarettes every day for many years while Samantha has never smoked at all.\\nThe Background gives us information about cigarette health warnings which tell of some of the risks associated with smoking such as lung disease, cancer, stroke and heart disease (the question specifically mentions heart disease). It can be inferred that since both women have similar lifestyles except for one being a smoker, then in this scenario it would seem reasonable to say that Samantha who does not smoke cigarettes will likely experience less risk of developing heart disease than her mother because she does not use tobacco products like her mother does. So given the context provided by these two paragraphs we can conclude that \\"Samantha"},{"source":"Background: Woodrow Wilson Guthrie (; July 14, 1912 - October 3, 1967) was an American singer-songwriter, one of the most significant figures in American folk music; his songs, including social justice songs, such as \\"This Land Is Your Land\\", have inspired several generations both politically and musically. He wrote hundreds of political, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works. His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, Dust Bowl Ballads, is included on Mojo magazine's 100 Records That Changed The World. Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress.\\nContext: Guthrie was born 14 July 1912 in Okemah, a small town in Okfuskee County, Oklahoma, the son of Nora Belle (nee Sherman) and Charles Edward Guthrie. His parents named him after Woodrow Wilson, then Governor of New Jersey and the Democratic candidate soon to be elected President of the United States. Charles Guthrie was an industrious businessman, owning at one time up to 30 plots of land in Okfuskee County. He was actively involved in Oklahoma politics and was a conservative Democratic candidate for office in the county. Charles Guthrie was involved in the 1911 lynching of Laura and L. D. Nelson. Woody Guthrie wrote three songs about the event and said that his father, Charles, was later a member of the revived Ku Klux Klan.  There were three significant fires during Guthrie's early life, including one that caused the loss of his family's home in Okemah. His sister Clara died after setting her clothes on fire during an argument with her mother when Guthrie was seven, and Guthrie's father was severely burned in a fire at home. Guthrie's mother, Nora, was afflicted with Huntington's disease, although the family did not know this at the time. It leads to dementia as well as muscular degeneration. She was committed to the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane. When Nora Guthrie was institutionalized, Woody Guthrie was 14. His father Charley was living and working in Pampa, Texas, to repay his debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. Woody and his siblings were on their own in Oklahoma; they relied on their eldest brother Roy for support. The 14-year-old Woody Guthrie worked odd jobs around Okemah, begging meals and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends.  Guthrie had a natural affinity for music, learning old ballads and traditional English and Scottish songs from the parents of friends. Guthrie befriended an African-American harmonica playing shoeshine boy named \\"George\\". After listening to him play the blues, Guthrie bought his own harmonica and began playing along with him. He used to busk for money and food. Although he did not excel as a student (he dropped out of high school in his fourth year and did not graduate), his teachers described him as bright. He was an avid reader on a wide range of topics. Friends recall his reading constantly.  In 1929, Guthrie's father sent for his son to come to Texas, but little changed for the aspiring musician. Guthrie, then 18, was reluctant to attend high school classes in Pampa and spent much time learning songs by busking on the streets and reading in the library at Pampa's city hall. He was able to gain experience by regularly playing at dances with his father's half-brother Jeff Guthrie, a fiddle player. At age 19, Guthrie met and married his first wife, Mary Jennings, with whom he had three children, Gwendolyn, Sue, and Bill. His mother died in 1930 while in the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane.\\nQuestion: who is woody guthrie?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Guthrie was born 14 July 1912","rationale":"The context clearly identifies Woody Guthrie as the protagonist of this paragraph.

Passage 1:Cungagnaq (; date of birth unknown - d. 1815) is venerated as a martyr and saint (as Peter the Aleut; ) by some jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

He is purported to have been captured by Spanish soldiers near \\"San Pedro\\" and tortured and killed at the instigation of Roman Catholic priests either there or at a nearby location. At the time identified for his death, California was Spanish territory, and Spain was worried about Russian advances southwards from Alaska.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: Almost all surfaces reflect some of the light that strikes them. The still water of the lake in Figure 22.9 reflects almost all of the light that strikes it. The reflected light forms an image of nearby objects. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflected or refracted light. If a surface is extremely smooth, like very still water, then an image formed by reflection is sharp and clear. This is called regular reflection. If the surface is even slightly rough, an image may not form, or if there is an image, it is blurry or fuzzy. This is called diffuse reflection. Both types of reflection are represented in Figure 22.10. You can also see animations of both types of reflection at this URL: [Link] In Figure 22.10, the waves of light are represented by arrows called rays. Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are known as reflected rays. In regular reflection, all the rays are reflected in the same direction. This explains why regular reflection forms a clear image. In diffuse reflection, in contrast, the rays are reflected in many different directions. This is why diffuse reflection forms, at best, a blurry image. One thing is true of both regular and diffuse reflection. The angle at which the reflected rays bounce off the surface is equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface. This is the law of reflection, and it applies to the reflection of all light. The law is illustrated in Figure 22.11 and in the animation at this URL: Mirrors are usually made of glass with a shiny metal backing that reflects all the light that strikes it. Mirrors may have flat or curved surfaces. The shape of a mirrors surface determines the type of image the mirror forms. For example, the image may be real or virtual. A real image forms in front of a mirror where reflected light rays actually meet. It is a true image that could be projected on a screen. A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror. Of course, reflected rays dont actually go behind a mirror, so a virtual image doesnt really exist. It just appears to exist to the human eye and brain. Most mirrors are plane mirrors. A plane mirror has a flat reflective surface and forms only virtual images. The image formed by a plane mirror is also life sized. But something is different about the image compared with the real object in front of the mirror. Left and right are reversed. Look at the man shaving in Figure 22.12. He is using his right hand to hold the razor, but his image appears to be holding the razor in the left hand. Almost all plane mirrors reverse left and right in this way. Some mirrors have a curved rather than flat surface. Curved mirrors can be concave or convex. A concave mirror is shaped like the inside of a bowl. This type of mirror forms either real or virtual images, depending on where the object is placed relative to the focal point. The focal point is the point in front of the mirror where the reflected rays intersect. You can see how concave mirrors form images in Figure 22.13 and in the interactive animation at the URL below. The animation allows you to move an object to see how its position affects the image. Concave mirrors are used behind car headlights. They focus the light and make it brighter. They are also used in some telescopes. The other type of curved mirror, a convex mirror, is shaped like the outside of a bowl. This type of mirror forms only virtual images. The image is always right-side up and smaller than the actual object, which makes the object appear farther away than it really is. You can see how a convex mirror forms an image in Figure 22.14 and in the animation at the URL below. Because of their shape, convex mirrors can gather and reflect light from a wide area. This is why they are used as side mirrors on cars. They give the driver a wider view of the area around the vehicle \\n Question: curving inward like the inside of a bowl","target":"concave","rationale":"The answer should be 'concave' as it is a shortest continous span that answers the question."},{"source":"Who id the most well-known Whitehead scholar?","target":"John B.

Little information is available on the role of major traffic hubs, such as airports, in the transmission of respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza and a pandemic threat. We investigated the presence of respiratory viruses in the passenger environment of a major airport in order to identify risk points and guide measures to minimize transmission. Methods: Surface and air samples were collected weekly at three different time points during the peak period of seasonal influenza in 2015-16 in Finland. Swabs from surface samples, and air samples were tested by realtime PCR for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43).","target":"Deposition of respiratory virus pathogens on frequently touched surfaces at airports","rationale":"The main findings in this study are that the frequency of detection of respiratory viruses on surfaces was relatively low (1.9%), and that there was no evidence for contamination of air samples.

This result indicates that the risk for transmission is mainly from person-to-person contact, rather than from contaminated surfaces or aerosols.

Always a little troubled, in and out of homes, but eventually she was living with her dad, but he was a bit of trouble, so she moved in with her boyfriend (J) and his family, but this meant moving 1.5 hours away from the main friendship group, essentially making her the \\"left out friend\\" (although she made no real effort to come see us). Fast forward about 6 months,  J’s dad received a job offer which forced his parents to move a further 2 hour drive east, so D and J could not do that due to work commitments, so they moved to an inner city apartment. D had no idea how to move her belongings, even refused to hire a truck so she basically begged a bunch of people. I was one of her only friends with a car so I was roped into doing some of the moving, although I didn’t particularly want to. For me it was a 1 hour drive to J’s place, then it was a further 2 hours back to their new apartment, and this trip happened 3 times.  Each time she did pay me $50 though. \\n\\nOne year later, her lease is up and has to move again. During the year contact was sparse with me and D, both busy with various things, then she pulls the same stunt as last year, although after realising how hard moving was, she ordered a truck, but still needed me and another guy to help her move. This time it was only 1 trip, but I was very reluctant to help as I remembered the horrors of last time (for reference she has severe OCD with her things).  So reluctantly I went and helped her, wasting my Friday night that I could have spent out with my friends. This time was not as bad as the other time but it went smooth enough were it wasn’t terrible. 1 hour drive up then a 25 minute drive to her new place, not as bad. But after it’s all said and done, we have a little get together with a few mates the next night and we come to the part where I may be the asshole. So she was just talking about money and debt she owes to people to my friend, and then she mentions that she owes me $50 for the move, then says I should have done it for free as we were friends. This was in reference to the other guy that helped her move, she had known him for about a year and he didn’t accept any payment, just food. I was taken aback a little as I know had the situation been reversed, she would not have helped me and my girlfriend move.

Sixty-three infants underwent coarctation repair by resection between 1960 and 1980, and 62 underwent subclavian angioplasty between 1977 and 1985. The mean age (+/- SEM) at operation for infants with subclavian flap angioplasty was 1.54 +/- 0.93 months and for infants with resection was 2.70 +/- 0.93 months (p = 0.02). There was no difference between the groups in patient weight at initial repair or the proportion of patients with complex anatomy or aortic arch hypoplasia. Follow-up duration for the subclavian flap group was 2.55 +/- 0.51 years (range 0.3 to 8.2), and for the resection group was 7.97 +/- 3.61 years (range 0.6 to 21). Indication for reoperation was the presence of a coarctation gradient at rest of 40 mm Hg or greater and arm hypertension. Reoperation was required in 5 patients in the subclavian flap group and 12 patients in the resection group. The mean reoperation rate after subclavian flap repair was 0.0356 reoperations per patient-year, and after resection was 0.0342 reoperations per patient-year (p = 0.94). To determine an individual's risk of requiring reoperation from these group measures, a reoperation risk model was developed. The risk of reoperation by the fifth postoperative year was found to be 16.3% after subclavian flap repair and 15.7% after resection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aging","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract provides information about a study that investigated the influence of surgical technique on the need for reoperation after coarctation repair in infancy.

Viral metagenomics of cloacal swabs from 50 Neotropical birds collected in French Guiana revealed the presence of four complete astrovirus genomes. they constitute an early diverging novel monophyletic clade within the Avastrovirus phylogeny, representing a putative new astrovirus species (provisionally designated as Avastrovirus 5) according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classification criteria. their genomic organization shares some characteristics with Avastrovirus but also with Mamastrovirus. The pan-astrovirus RT-PCR analysis of the cloacal samples of 406 wild Neotropical birds showed a community-level prevalence of 4.9% (5.1% in passerines, the highest described so far in this order of birds). By screening birds of a remote region, we expanded the known host range of astroviruses to the avian families Cardinalidae, Conopophagidae, Furnariidae, thamnophilidae, Turdidae and Tyrannidae. Our results provide important first insights into the unexplored viral communities, the ecology, epidemiology and features of host-pathogen interactions that shape the evolution of avastroviruses in a remote Neotropical rainforest. The last decades have witnessed a broadening of the global diversity of viruses thanks to rapidly evolving random amplification sequencing technology. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized our knowledge by not only uncovering the diversity of viruses at an unprecedented rate, but also by allowing to gain insight into their ecology and distribution, helping to disentangle the network that connects viruses with their hosts and the geographical scenario in which such interactions take place 1 . However, deciphering the global virome and its structure becomes challenging not just because of the technical difficulties associated with the screening of diverse viruses, but because their many hosts are often understudied, particularly those from remote areas. The Neotropical region is one such example; being among the most biodiverse realms on Earth, Neotropical rainforests are candidates to host and conserve relevant parts of the virosphere diversity 2 . However, the knowledge of Neotropical viral diversity and their hosts is in its infancy. Given that zoonotic viruses are considered the most probable causative agents of emerging diseases 3 and that mammal and avian species are their main hosts 4,5 , the study of the wildlife viral diversity and their ecological context in these remote areas will provide important information for public and animal health to prevent potential new emerging viral epidemics 2,6 .

Entering the game, the Bears were 54-35-5 in season openers, the most wins of any team, and they had not lost an opening game since 2009, the most in the NFC and second-most in the NFL behind the New England Patriots. The Bears were 7-4 against the Bills, with their last meeting being a 22-19 victory in Toronto in 2010, while winning 40-7 in the last game between the two at Soldier Field; the Bears had won all five meetings between the two in Chicago. When comparing the two teams in 2013 statistically, the Bears had the advantage in three offensive categories (points scored, total offense, and passing offense), while the Bills had the second-best rushing offense, compared to the Bears' 16th-ranked rushing game. On defense, the Bears were outmatched in all three categories (total defense, rushing defense, and passing defense), but are one spot higher than Buffalo in turnover ratio (+5 to +3). Scout.com's Jeremy Stoltz writes that one of the players the Bears must contain is the defensive tackle duo of Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus, who had a combined 139 total tackles, 18.0 sacks and two forced fumbles during 2013. While the Bears' offensive line boasted the fourth-least sacks, none of the five starters played in the preseason. As a result, to combat the rush, the Bears need Jay Cutler to release the ball quickly. For the Bears' defense, Stoltz stated all the Bears needed to do was stop Buffalo's running backs Fred Jackson and C. J. Spiller, as the Bills had the second-best rushing attack in the league. The Bears were favored to win by seven points, the third-largest spread of the week. Matt Fort&#233;, Charles Tillman, and Robbie Gould were the captains for the game. David Fales, Kelvin Hayden, Tony Fiammetta, Khaseem Greene, Charles Leno, Jr., David Bass and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the game. The Bears won the coin toss, and elected to kick. After Buffalo punted, Chicago scored on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, which the Bills retaliated with E. J. Manuel's two-yard touchdown run. On the Bears' first drive of the second quarter, Brandon Marshall fumbled, with linebacker Preston Brown recovering; the Bills would score on Dan Carpenter's 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler was intercepted by former Bear Corey Graham after Bennett did not \\"turn to look for the ball in time\\", with the Bills again capitalizing on the takeaway, with Manuel's seven-yard touchdown pass to Spiller, and the half ended with Buffalo leading 17-7. On the Bears' first possession of the third quarter, Gould kicked a five-yard field goal, and on the Bills' first drive of the half, Chris Conte read a pass intended for Marquise Goodwin, stepping in front of the pass to intercept the ball. On Chicago's ensuing drive, the offense rallied to tie the score on Cutler's 11-yard touchdown pass to Marshall. In the fourth quarter, the Bears drove from their own six-yard line to reach the Buffalo 34, but Cutler's forced pass intended for Bennett was intercepted by Kyle Williams; Carpenter would kick a 33-yard field goal, which the Bears responded with Gould's 37-yarder. The Bills would kneel to end regulation with a 20-20 score. After the Bears went three-and-out, the Bills started on their own 22-yard line, but drove to the Bears' 39. On the next play, Jackson found a hole in the line of scrimmage, getting past Lance Briggs. Conte reached Jackson at the 20-yard line, but was stiff-armed; Conte attempted to tackle again, but was knocked down, with Jackson being pushed out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays later, Carpenter kicked the game-winning 27-yard field goal. Four of the Bears' offensive starters suffered injuries during the game: Roberto Garza (right ankle) and Matt Slauson (left ankle) did not play after the first half, Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) departed in the third quarter, while Marshall (right ankle) was hurt after being tackled. Conte received scrutiny after the game for failing to tackle Jackson, but defended himself by saying, \\"It was a play where it's the end of the game - I've got to get the ball out or something. If I hit him, it's a field goal no matter what, so I've got to try and get the ball out.

Passage 1:On 4 November 1877 the Russian army achieved a victory at Uzunahmet, having inflicted heavy casualties on the Turks, which included 3,000 killed and wounded, 1,000 prisoners and 42 artillery pieces left by the panicked gunners, with a loss of only 1,200 men. Although the Turkish troops ceased resistance and were fleeing in disarray, with 4,000 of them deserting the army, a part of their infantry maintained order and retreated to the well-fortified position in Erzurum with 14 guns. The Russians, being miles away and exhausted by the battle, did not chase them and therefore missed a chance to capture Erzurum on the heels of the fleeing enemy. Having developed a plan of assault on the stronghold, the Russian army advanced under the cover of night, but had difficulties of movement control in the dark. A part of their troops from the 153th Infantry Regiment mistook their direction and captured one of the redoubts, Azizieh, all by themselves, without help from the rest of the army, but had to leave it due to the lack of support. All the three Turkish battalions stationed in the Azizieh redoubt were routed, numbering 1,600, whereas the Russians lost 400 or 600 men in this battle. After the Russians left Azizieh, the Turks made an attempt to counterattack them, but were successfully driven back. As the works of Erzurum were too strong to be taken by assault, the siege park was needed at Kars and in the following days the weather set in with a snowstorm, the Russians decided to withdraw their army and instead attack Kars, which they succeeded in capturing. Ahmed Muhtar Pasha, the Ottoman commander during the siege, requested reinforcements from Istanbul and was receiving them all through November. After epidemics broke out, he withdrew his forces to Bayburt for the remainder of the war. Muhtar Pasha was awarded the title Ghazi for his role in the defence of Erzurum, Gedikler and Yahniler. The city of Erzurum would be captured by the Russians a few months later, on 8 February 1878.\\n Passage 2:José Efraín Ríos Montt (; June 16, 1926 – April 1, 2018) was a Guatemalan general, politician, and war criminal who served as President of Guatemala. Born in Huehuetenango, he was a dictator who took power as a result of a coup d'état on March 23, 1982. He was overthrown by his defense minister, Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores, in another coup d'état on August 8, 1983. In the 2003 presidential elections, Ríos Montt unsuccessfully ran as the candidate of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG). In 2007 he returned to public office as a member of Congress, thereby gaining prosecutorial immunity. He was protected from a pair of long-running lawsuits alleging war crimes against him and a number of his former ministers and counselors during their term in the presidential palace in 1982–83. His immunity ended on January 14, 2012, with the end of his term in legislative office. On January 26, 2012, he appeared in court in Guatemala and was formally indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity.\\n Passage 3:Employed from 1807 to 1811 on the staff in North America, Brevet-Colonel Kempt at the end of 1811 joined Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington's army in Spain with the local rank of major general, which was, on 1 January 1812, made substantive. As one of Thomas Picton's brigadiers, Kempt took part in the great assault on Badajoz and was severely wounded. On rejoining for duty, he was posted to the command of a brigade of the Light Division (43rd Regiment of Foot, 95th Rifles, and 3rd Portuguese Light Infantry) in time to fight at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813. He also led his brigade at the Battle of the Pyrenees at the end of July, and at the Battle of the Bidassoa, where his troops stormed French defenses near Mont La Rhune on 7 October.

It’s brash, unspecific and general, but I’m afraid I have a severe lack of knowledge on different syndromes and disabilities and I am unable to specify which disorder her daughter lives with. It does not appear to be a physical disability. \\n\\nA bit of background: I’m a customer assistant at the local shop where I live. I’ve worked here for over a year, and I’m generally praised for my communication skills with our customers and I often receive positive feedback from customers themselves. I like working there and I like the customers (apart from the odd few, but y’know, retail). \\n\\nOur shop is very small and only ever has 2-3 people working a shift at one time. This means we get to know our customers on a reasonably personal level. This woman and her daughter come in to the shop often as they live nearby. They initially made a point of getting to know everyone by name, which I appreciated as it was friendly. But they continued to get closer. The mum will come in with her daughter (who is around 24, and a very sweet girl, but is very attached to her mum and will do anything she says), and will say to her daughter ‘oh look, _____ is working, to give him/her a hug’. This happens very often and not all staff are comfortable with this, particularly some of the males, but we are all often afraid to say no. \\n\\nFurthermore, the mum began asking, on her daughters behalf, if we could add her (the daughter) on Facebook/WhatsApp so she could have friends. One of my colleagues felt too awkward to say no and now the daughter messages her 24/7, comments on all of her Facebook posts, and proceeded to find all other social media through her Facebook. She posts statuses saying ‘_____ is my best friend’ and tags my colleague. The mum will also say ‘there’s your best friend’ or even ‘there’s your sister/brother’ to her daughter and point to members of staff, and I even heard her refer to my boss as her daughters dad. This makes the daughter believe she is much closer to the staff than she really is. \\n\\nHer mum has begun to walk straight into the office at work, which even the customer assistants are not allowed to do, because she believes her and her daughter are on close terms with our staff. We are all far too uncomfortable to tell her no for fear of discrimination. Her mum is also very touchy with staff, for example, stroked my boss’s beard and told him he needed to shave. The next time they were in, her daughter did the same, because she has obviously seen her mum do this and assumed it was appropriate behaviour.\\n\\nToday, they came into the shop, and told me they liked my hair. The mum asked me if I could come round to their house for a ‘girls day’ and do her daughters hair. Her daughter became so excited and asked for my phone number to arrange this. The mum said she’d make lunch and take us out afterward. I understand that it just be hard for her that her daughter doesn’t have friends, but this is not the way to help her make them. I very so awkward and under a lot of pressure, that I claimed I was super busy over the next couple weeks. She asked for my number and my rota of shifts so she could see when I’m free, and I finally broke and told her to stop.

John's father, Henry II, had forced William the Lion to swear fealty to him at the Treaty of Falaise in 1174. This had been rescinded by Richard I in exchange for financial compensation in 1189, but the relationship remained uneasy. John began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties. He refused William's request for the earldom of Northumbria, but did not intervene in Scotland itself and focused on his continental problems. The two kings maintained a friendly relationship, meeting in 1206 and 1207, until it was rumoured in 1209 that William was intending to ally himself with Philip II of France. John invaded Scotland and forced William to sign the Treaty of Norham, which gave John control of William's daughters and required a payment of £10,000. This effectively crippled William's power north of the border, and by 1212 John had to intervene militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal rivals.[nb 16] John made no efforts to reinvigorate the Treaty of Falaise, though, and both William and Alexander remained independent kings, supported by, but not owing fealty to, John.","target":"John, King of England","rationale":"The context is clearly about John, King of England.

Keane took up boxing at the age of nine and trained for a number of years, winning all of his four bouts in the novice league.\\nContext: Keane made headlines again in the 2001 Manchester derby, when five minutes from the final whistle, he was sent off for a blatant knee-high foul on Alf-Inge Haland in what was seen by many as an act of revenge. He initially received a three-match suspension and a PS5,000 fine from The Football Association (FA), but further punishment was to follow after the release of Keane's autobiography in August 2002, in which he stated that he intended \\"to hurt\\" Haland. Keane's account of the incident was as follows:  I'd waited long enough. I fucking hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you cunt. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.  An admission that the tackle was in fact a premeditated assault, it left the FA with no choice but to charge Keane with bringing the game into disrepute. He was banned for a further five matches and fined PS150,000 in the ensuing investigation. Despite widespread condemnation, he later maintained in an interview that he had no regrets about the incident: \\"My attitude was, fuck him. What goes around comes around. He got his just rewards. He fucked me over and my attitude is an eye for an eye\\", and said he would probably do the same thing again.  Haland later implied that the tackle effectively finished his playing career as he never played a full game afterwards. However, Haland did complete the match and played 68 minutes of the following game. He also played a friendly for Norway in between both matches. It was, in fact, a long-standing injury to his left knee that ended his career rather than his right.\\nQuestion: What are some important aspects of the knee-high foul on Alf-Inge?.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success.\\nDue to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success.

The first Quranic manuscripts lacked these marks, therefore several recitations remain acceptable. The variation in readings of the text permitted by the nature of the defective vocalization led to an increase in the number of readings during the 10th century. The 10th-century Muslim scholar from Baghdad, Ibn Mujāhid, is famous for establishing seven acceptable textual readings of the Quran. He studied various readings and their trustworthiness and chose seven 8th-century readers from the cities of Mecca, Medina, Kufa, Basra and Damascus. Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers, rather than six or ten, but this may be related to a prophetic tradition (Muhammad's saying) reporting that the Quran had been revealed in seven \\"ahruf\\" (meaning seven letters or modes). Today, the most popular readings are those transmitted by Ḥafṣ (d.796) and Warsh (d. 812) which are according to two of Ibn Mujahid's reciters, Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud (Kufa, d. 745) and Nafi‘ al-Madani (Medina, d. 785), respectively. The influential standard Quran of Cairo (1924) uses an elaborate system of modified vowel-signs and a set of additional symbols for minute details and is based on ʻAsim's recitation, the 8th-century recitation of Kufa.

Congress readily obliged the President's request, voting to declare war on Germany by a margin of 373-50 in the House and 82-6 in the Senate. This decision of the United States government to enter World War I was backed up with additional legislation imposing military conscription in America to staff the nation's wartime Army and Navy. On May 18, 1917, a draft bill became law. The bill called for all eligible young men nationwide to register for the draft on a single day — June 5, 1917. While isolated hotspots of anti-conscription activity sprang up in some urban centers, the registration process was generally an orderly affair, with the vast majority of young American men accepting their fate with what has been characterized as \\"a calm resignation.\\" On July 20, 1917, a blindfolded Newton D. Baker, the Wilson administration's Secretary of War, drew numbers choosing certain registered young men for mandatory military service. Opponents of American participation in the war continued their efforts to change the country's course, holding meetings and distributing pamphlets. Among the leading organized forces in opposition to conscription and the war was the Socialist Party of America, which at its April 1917 National Convention had declared its \\"unalterable opposition\\" to the war and urged the workers of the world to \\"refuse support to the governments in their wars.\\"\\n\\nQuestion about the article:","target":"How many months passed between the appearance of Woodrow Wilson before Congress and the initiation of the draft?","rationale":"To solve the problem \\"How many months passed between the appearance of Woodrow Wilson before Congress and the initiation of the draft?\\", we need to find out when Woodrow Wilson appeared before Congress and when did he initiate a military conscription.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are touching. Friction can work for or against us. For example, putting sand on an icy sidewalk increases friction so you are less likely to slip. On the other hand, too much friction between moving parts in a car engine can cause the parts to wear out. Other examples of friction are illustrated in Figure 13.7. You can see an animation showing how friction opposes motion at this URL: [Link] Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth. Even surfaces that look smooth to the unaided eye appear rough or bumpy when viewed under a microscope. Look at the metal surfaces in Figure 13.8. The metal foil is so smooth that it is shiny. However, when highly magnified, the surface of metal appears to be very bumpy. All those mountains and valleys catch and grab the mountains and valleys of any other surface that contacts the metal. This creates friction. Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. Thats why we put sand on icy sidewalks and roads. The blades of skates are much smoother than the soles of shoes. Thats why you cant slide as far across ice with shoes as you can with skates (see Figure 13.9). The rougher surface of shoes causes more friction and slows you down. Heavier objects also have more friction because they press together with greater force. Did you ever try to push boxes or furniture across the floor? Its harder to overcome friction between heavier objects and the floor than it is between lighter objects and the floor. You know that friction produces heat. Thats why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer. But do you know why the rubbing produces heat? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It also lets you light a match (see Figure 13.10). On the other hand, heat from friction can be a problem inside a car engine. It can cause the car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts and makes them slippery so there is less friction. There are different ways you could move heavy boxes. You could pick them up and carry them. You could slide them across the floor. Or you could put them on a dolly like the one in Figure 13.11 and roll them across the floor. This example illustrates three types of friction: static friction, sliding friction, and rolling friction. Another type of friction is fluid friction. All four types of friction are described below. In each type, friction works opposite the direction of the force applied to a move an object. You can see a video demonstration of the different types of friction at this URL: (1:07). Static friction acts on objects when they are resting on a surface. For example, if you are walking on a sidewalk, there is static friction between your shoes and the concrete each time you put down your foot (see Figure 13.12). Without this static friction, your feet would slip out from under you, making it difficult to walk. Static friction also allows you to sit in a chair without sliding to the floor. Can you think of other examples of static friction? Sliding friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding over a surface. Sliding friction is weaker than static friction. Thats why its easier to slide a piece of furniture over the floor after you start it moving than it is to get it moving in the first place. Sliding friction can be useful. For example, you use sliding friction when you write with a pencil and when you put on your bikes brakes. Rolling friction is friction that acts on objects when they are rolling over a surface. Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction or static friction. This explains why it is much easier to move boxes on a wheeled dolly than by carrying or sliding them. It also explains why most forms of ground transportation use wheels, including cars, 4-wheelers, bicycles, roller \\n Question: type of friction between an object and a gas or liquid","target":"fluid friction","rationale":"The answer should be a short continous span from the passage.

His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.\\nAs a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.

In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Giants QB Eli Manning completed a 33-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress. In the second quarter, the Rams responded with kicker Josh Brown getting a 54-yard field goal, yet New York answered with kicker John Carney kicking a 39-yard field goal. St. Louis would reply with Brown's 54-yard field goal, yet the Giants answered with Carney nailing a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York increased its lead with Manning completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer. In the fourth quarter, the Rams tried to rally as WR Torry Holt made a 45-yard juggling, circus catch in the end zone from QB Marc Bulger, making the Rams down 20-13 with 10 minutes 46 seconds left to play. However, the Giants pulled away with Manning's 18-yard TD pass to RB Ahmad Bradshaw, DE Justin Tuck's 41-yard interception return for a touchdown, and Bradshaw's 31-yard TD run.

J. Cherryh, published by DAW Books. They concern a time-traveling heroine, Morgaine, and her loyal companion Nhi Vanye i Chya.\\n\\n- A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.\\n\\n- The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.\\n\\n- Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".\\n\\n- Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.\\n\\n- Well of Shiuan is a 1978 science fiction novel written by C. J. Cherryh . It is the second of four books composing the Morgaine Stories , chronicling the deeds of Morgaine , a woman obsessed with a mission of the utmost importance , and her warrior companion , Nhi Vanye i Chya .\\n\\n- Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\\n\\n- DAW Books is an American science fiction and fantasy publisher, founded by Donald A. Wollheim following his departure from Ace Books in 1971. The company therefore claims to be \\"the first publishing company ever devoted exclusively to science fiction and fantasy.\\" The first DAW Book published was the 1972 short story collection \\"Spell of the Witch World\\" by Andre Norton.\\n\\n- Downbelow Station is a science fiction novel written by C. J. Cherryh and published in 1981 by DAW Books. It won the Hugo Award in 1982, was shortlisted for a Locus Award that same year, and was named by \\"Locus\\" magazine as one of the top 50 science fiction novels of all time in 1987.\\n\\n- The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Carolyn Janice Cherry (born September 1, 1942), better known by the pen name C. J. Cherryh, is an American writer of speculative fiction. She has written more than 60 books since the mid-1970s, including the Hugo Award-winning novels \\"Downbelow Station\\" (1981) and \\"Cyteen\\" (1988), both set in her Alliance-Union universe.\\n\\n\\n\\n'well of shiuan' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'publisher'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- ace books\\n - creatures\\n - daw books\\n - faster than light\\n - naturalis\\n - plume\\n - portal\\n - unknown","target":"daw books","rationale":"The information mentions that Well of Shiuan is a 1978 science fiction novel written by C.

We highlight the key challenge is to compute non-additive and context-independent importance for individual words and phrases. We show some prior efforts on hierarchical explanations, e.g. contextual decomposition,  do not satisfy the desired properties mathematically, leading to inconsistent explanation quality in different models. In this paper, we propose a formal way to quantify the importance of each word or phrase to generate hierarchical explanations. We modify contextual decomposition algorithms according to our formulation, and propose a model-agnostic explanation algorithm with competitive performance. Human evaluation and automatic metrics evaluation on both LSTM models and fine-tuned BERT Transformer models on multiple datasets show that our algorithms robustly outperform prior works on hierarchical explanations.

Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately 10,000 ft (3,000 m), tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line to the base of the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant.

When less than the maximum amount of solute is dissolved in a given amount of solute, the solution is unsaturated. These terms are also qualitative terms because each solute has its own solubility. A solution of 0.00019 g of AgCl per 100 g of H2O may be saturated, but with so little solute dissolved, it is also rather dilute. A solution of 36.1 g of NaCl in 100 g of H2O is also saturated but rather concentrated. Ideally, we need more precise ways of specifying the amount of solute in a solution. We will introduce such ways in Section 11.2 \\"Quantitative Units of Concentration\\". In some circumstances, it is possible to dissolve more than the maximum amount of a solute in a solution. Usually, this happens by heating the solvent, dissolving more solute than would normally dissolve at regular temperatures, and letting the solution cool down slowly and carefully. Such solutions are called supersaturated solutions and are not stable; given an opportunity (such as dropping a crystal of solute in the solution), the excess solute will precipitate from the solution. It should be obvious that some solutes dissolve in certain solvents but not others. NaCl, for example, dissolves in water but not in vegetable oil. Beeswax dissolves in liquid hexane but not water. What is it that makes a solute soluble in some solvents but not others? The answer is intermolecular interactions. The intermolecular interactions include London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding (as described in Chapter 10 \\"Solids and Liquids\\").

I’ve known C since I was young, but since he’s older I didn’t talk to him much before now. We’re now good friends.\\n\\nAnyway, last Tuesday I had a breakdown at youth group. Me and this group were watching Hereditary and someone asked if the dog died, and asked someone to google it, so I did.

I have a social disorder and I can’t tell when someone’s being serious or not, as well as anxiety and depression, so I took it seriously. This isn’t the first time this group has made jokes making fun of me; C pretends to bully me and I’m fine with it, but I’ve started to read too much into it.\\n\\nLong story short, I left youth group in tears and didn’t respond to E and C’s texts asking where I went. I later returned after finally talking to E, where she told me I was only noticing the times everyone was saying things about me. I trust and love E and I don’t at all think this was gaslighting or anything, and I think I was reading too much into it. When I got back, everyone acted differently and a lot more gentle with me.\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve broken down in front of these people.

We didn't talk or see each other much since he got sent to Japan for the majority of the past decade, but he would come back once a year or so and we would spend a couple days together. He retired from the Air Force in late 2017 and began work as a civilian contractor back in the states in February of 2018.\\n\\nI don't know why, but we still rarely talked. The last time I spoke to him was January of 2017. This is now my absolutely deepest regret. I wish so much that I tried to reach out and tell him that I loved him more often...\\n\\nI got a call at 4 am on a Monday morning from his wife telling me that he had shot and killed himself. So I drove over 20 hours to be with her, my very young half siblings, and my grandparents. While there, I learned that my dad and stepmother had gotten into an argument due to him drinking excessively, so he was drunk when he did it. Apparently he would drink quite a bit almost every single night. It escalated into a very heated screaming match. She said she was going to call the cops. Apparently he told her, \\"If you call the cops, then it's all over\\". She ended up locking herself in the bathroom (not to call them, just to calm down) and while she was in there, she heard a gunshot come from the living room. My dad had shot himself in the head with an AK-47. \\n\\nNow to get to the point. \\n\\nI recently expressed to my sister that as much as I love my father and am still absolutely devastated, heartbroken and confused. I also *hate* him for what he's done.

Generally, 'prime' indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots. Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.

At this time, too, strong volcanic activity was common on Earth, so it is likely that these first organisms—the first prokaryotes—were adapted to very high temperatures. These are not the typical temperate environments in which most life flourishes today; thus, we can conclude that the first organisms that appeared on Earth likely were able to withstand harsh conditions. Microbial mats may represent the earliest forms of life on Earth, and there is fossil evidence of their presence, starting about 3.5 billion years ago. A microbial mat is a large biofilm, a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes (Figure 13.3a), including mostly bacteria, but also archaea. Microbial mats are a few centimeters thick, and they typically grow on moist surfaces. Their various types of prokaryotes carry out different metabolic pathways, and for this reason, they reflect various colors. Prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a gummy-like substance that they secrete. The first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from hydrothermal vents. A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in Earth’s surface that releases geothermally heated water. With the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy source—sunlight—whereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for food.\\n\\n\\nQ: Before the atmosphere became oxygenated, the planet was subjected to what harmful energy source, meaning the first organisms would have flourished where they were more protected?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- evaporation\\n\\n- conduction\\n\\n- convection\\n\\n- radiation\\n\\nA:","target":"radiation","rationale":"Given the context before and after, we can infer that radiation is what needs to be protected against.

A copy of the transcription regulatory sequence for ORF6 (TRS6) was inserted between the N protein and 3′-UTR to drive the transcription of the EGFP gene and yield a general purpose expression vector. Successful recovery of PRRSV was obtained using an RNA polymerase II promoter to drive transcription of the full-length virus genome, which was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The recombinant virus showed growth replication characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus in the infected cells. In addition, the recombinant virus stably expressed EGFP for at least 10 passages. EGFP expression was detected at approximately 10 h post infection by live-cell imaging to follow the virus spread in real time and the infection of neighbouring cells occurred predominantly through cell-to-cell-contact. Finally, the recombinant virus generated was found to be an excellent tool for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compound screening. The newly established reverse genetics system for PRRSV could be a useful tool not only to monitor virus spread and screen for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compounds, but also for fundamental research on the biology of the virus.","target":"A novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vector system that stably expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein as a separate transcription unit","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nA novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vector system that stably expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein as a separate transcription unit."},{"source":"Read the following context and choose the best option to answer the question.\\nContext: The Canal has been an interest for the last 25 years .

Researchers on the project have yet to devise a system to generate enough power to operate it. When it becomes clear that this weapon has no wartime applications and is intended solely for illegal assassinations, one agent decries the project as immoral and refuses to take part. The remaining agents discuss eliminating the dissenting agent before going to lunch.\\nProfessor Jerry Hathaway (Atherton) meets high school student Mitch Taylor (Jarret) at the school's science fair. He informs Mitch that he has been admitted to Pacific Technical University, where he will room with physics \\"legend\\" Chris Knight (Kilmer). Hathaway is secretly developing the laser for the CIA, but instead of doing the work himself he has his unpaid students do it, while misappropriating the project funding to remodel his house. Arriving on campus, Mitch meets Chris and is disappointed to learn that he is an irreverent slacker who spends his time pulling elaborate high tech pranks (such as covering the dorm floor in ice to go skating). Mitch also meets Jordan (Meyrink), a hyperkinetic female student, \\"Ick\\" Ikagami, a brilliant and affable foil to Chri's antics, and the mysterious Lazlo Hollyfeld (Jon Gries), a middle-aged man who seems to be living in Mitch's closet. Hathaway's sycophantic graduate assistant Kent (Prescott) becomes hostile when Hathaway puts Mitch in charge of the laser project.\\nUnder pressure to get results, Hathaway gives Chris an unrealistic timetable, which Chris dismisses. When Mitch is caught attending Chris' pool party instead of working in the lab, Hathaway berates him. The next day Mitch is mortified when a recording of his tearful phone call to his parents is played over a loudspeaker system during lunch, a prank conceived by Kent and his cronies. Humiliated, Mitch is ready to quit school. Chris convinces him to stay by explaining to him that Lazlo was the top genius at Pacific Tech in the 1970s, but suffered a breakdown when he learned that his theories were being used to build weapons. Chris tells Mitch that if he does not want to \\"crack\\" like Hollyfeld, he must learn to have fun, and the first order of business is to get even with Kent, calling it a \\"moral imperative\\" to do so. They accomplish this by disassembling Kent's car and rebuilding it inside his dorm room. Kent vows revenge.\\nUnder increasing pressure from the CIA, Hathaway berates Chris for failing to solve the laser power problem and promises to fail him and prevent him from graduating. After a pep-talk from Mitch, Chris devotes himself to solving the power problem and achieving a perfect score on Hathaway's final exam. Mitch is accosted by Sherry Nugel (D'arbanville), a beautiful older woman who seeks amorous encounters with the top ten geniuses in the country (which is revealed earlier when she seduces Chris). Mitch turns her down, realizing he's in love with Jordan, and the two become a couple. Though Chris aces Hathway's exam, Chris and Mitch's efforts appear to be ruined when Kent sabotages the laser. In a fit of anger at the laser's destruction, he has an epiphany that solves the power problem. The beam of the redesigned laser has unlimited range and produces an estimated six megawatts of power, exceeding the original requirement.\\nWhile the team celebrates its success, Lazlo insists that the high-energy laser can only be used as a weapon, and in fact that it must have been conceived for this purpose. Chris is devastated. Hathaway has removed the laser from the lab. Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan trick Kent into revealing the date when the laser is going to be tested by placing a microphone in his braces and convincing him that God is talking to him. The group tails Hathaway to a nearby Air Force base.

Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing:\\nSome minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle.

Anthropomorphic figurines have been found in the Balkans from 6000 BC, and in Central Europe by c. 5800 BC (La Hoguette). Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vinča culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vinča signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing. The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300 BC. The megalithic temple complexes of Ġgantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to c. 3600 BC. The Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta.

After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it.

The Delaware River and Schuylkill Rivers served as early boundaries between which the city's early street plan was kept within.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 million barrels (160×10^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.\\n\\nWhat is synthetic crude oil usually called?","target":"syncrude","rationale":"In the text, syncrude is explained as a \\"synthetic crude oil equivalent\\".

She served as the First Lady of the United States from March 1933 to April 1945 during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office, making her the longest serving First Lady of the United States.  Roosevelt served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952. President Harry S. Truman later called her the \\"First Lady of the World\\" in tribute to her human rights achievements.\\n\\nRoosevelt's chief project during her husband's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities. Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where they could make a living by subsistence farming, handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant. She hoped the project could become a model for \\"a new kind of community\\" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for. Her husband enthusiastically supported the project.  After an initial, disastrous experiment with prefab houses, construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt's specifications, this time with \\"every modern convenience\\", including indoor plumbing and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years' time. Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community, the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians. After losing a community vote, Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners. The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken on the issue of racial discrimination.  Roosevelt remained a vigorous fundraiser for the community for several years, as well as spending most of her own income on the project. However, the project was criticized by both the political left and right. Conservatives condemned it as socialist and a \\"communist plot\\", while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes also opposed the project, citing its high per-family cost. Arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority for the federal government until 1941, when the U.S. sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss.  Later commentators generally described the Arthurdale experiment as a failure. Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which she felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered the town a \\"utopia\\" compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people's lives there and stating, \\"I don't know whether you think that is worth half a million dollars.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.","target":"Andy","rationale":"The question asks which researcher learned less about acetogenesis.

Epidermal growth factor receptor and p63 both possess oncogenic properties, including the potential to increase cell proliferation and antagonize apoptosis. ZD1839 (\\"Iressa\\") is an adenosine triphosphate-competitive inhibitor specific to the EGFR tyrosine kinase currently under evaluation as a chemotherapeutic agent in HNSCC. The objective was to investigate whether p63 expression is decreased after treatment of HNSCC cells with ZD1839. Downregulation of p63 by ZD1839 would identify a potential molecular relationship between EGFR signaling and p63 and could provide insight into the mechanism of action of ZD1839.', 'In vitro examination of p63 expression after ZD1839 treatment.', 'A human HNSCC cell line, SCC-012, was treated with varying doses of ZD1839. p63 protein and messenger RNA levels were analyzed by Western and Northern blot analyses.

Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine.\\nEager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971).

Tito's response on 17 May suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June. However, Tito did not attend the second meeting of the Cominform, fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. In 1949 the crisis nearly escalated into an armed conflict, as Hungarian and Soviet forces were massing on the northern Yugoslav frontier. On 28 June, the other member countries expelled Yugoslavia, citing \\"nationalist elements\\" that had \\"managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership\\" of the CPY. The assumption in Moscow was that once it was known that he had lost Soviet approval, Tito would collapse; 'I will shake my little finger and there will be no more Tito,' Stalin remarked. The expulsion effectively banished Yugoslavia from the international association of socialist states, while other socialist states of Eastern Europe subsequently underwent purges of alleged \\"Titoists\\".

At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death.

They are more likely to preserve good feelings and relationships by not saying something that might upset or offend  another person.

In fact, there is a better chance that the implied answer is \\"no\\".\\nOne interesting example of the Western preference for very direct communication can be seen in what Western students are taught about how they should organize their writing. Writers are generally expected to state their point as clearly as possible, generally right at the beginning. Students are taught to begin paragraphs with a \\"topic sentence\\" that states the point of the paragraph. Also, articles should generally begin with a brief statement of the points to be made -and also conclude with a review of those same points.

The 7-play, 91-yard scoring drive was highlighted by a 50-yard reception by Antonio Brown on a tipped ball. After a Zane Gonzalez field goal brought the Browns within 14-10 early in the third quarter, the Steelers drove down the field again. Roethlisberger threw a second touchdown pass to James to put them up by 11, 21-10. The drive was boosted by a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Browns cornerback Jamar Taylor on a deep pass intended for Brown.

In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children. A high number of children also worked as prostitutes.

But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man.

Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.

It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status.

Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs.\\n\\n- The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903.\\n\\n- The Union Association was a league in Major League Baseball which lasted for only one season in 1884 . St. Louis won the pennant and joined the National League the following season . Chicago moved to Pittsburgh in late August , and four teams folded during the season and were replaced . Although the league is conventionally listed as a major league , this status has been questioned by a number of modern baseball historians , most notably Bill James in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract . The league had a number of major league players ( on the St. Louis franchise , at least ) , but the league 's overall talent and organization was notably inferior to that of the two established major leagues . James found that the contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league either . The earliest record he could find of the Union Association as a major league was Ernest Lanigan 's The Baseball Cyclopedia , published in 1922 . For example , the league 's only \`\` star '' player , Fred Dunlap , led the league in batting average with .412 ( 86 points higher than his second - best season and 120 points higher than his career average ) , on - base percentage , slugging percentage , runs scored , hits , total bases , and home runs ( with just 13 , typical for the era ) . After the league folded , Dunlap never hit more than .274 or more than 10 home runs until he retired in 1891 , another measure of the inferior quality of the Union Association . Of the 272 players in the Association , 107 ( 39.34 % ) never played in another major league , while 72 ( 26.47 % ) played very briefly ( less than 300 at bats and / or 50 hits ) in other major leagues , and 79 ( 29.04 % ) had longer careers but little success in other major leagues .

Jurors convicted the seven Wednesday of multiple counts of child exploitation, pornography and obstruction of justice. Members of the organization used Internet news groups to swap and share \\"illegal images and videos depicting prepubescent children, including toddlers, engaged in various sexual and sadistic acts,\\" prosecutors said. An indictment filed in the case detailed interactions between group members as they swapped and commented on images. \\"My thanks to you and all the others that together make this the greatest group of pedos to ever gather in one place,\\" Freeman wrote in response to one posting, according to the indictment. And a posting from Castleman, cited in the indictment, read, \\"Thanks to all for the wonderful material that has been posted.\\" An Australian constable who infiltrated the group in August 2006 was among 50 witnesses testifying at trial. He told the jury that the group traded more than 400,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse before being dismantled by law enforcement, according to the Justice Department statement. Each defendant faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, fines and the possibility of supervised release for the rest of their lives, authorities said. The seven will be sentenced April 14. During the six-day trial, evidence showed the seven participated in what prosecutors called a \\"well-organized criminal enterprise whose purpose was to proliferate child sex abuse images to its membership during a two-year period.\\" \\"This was a wide-scale, high-volume, international trafficking enterprise that used sophisticated computer encryption technology and file-sharing techniques,\\" Matthew Friedrich, acting assistant attorney general, said in the statement.
