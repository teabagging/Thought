With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, carmine, which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto.

Turner.","target":"madder lake","rationale":"The context describes how two pigments were traditionally made from dyes extracted from insects and plants.

They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture).\\nIn the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\".  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.  As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.","target":"surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period","rationale":"The text describes the content of the Catacombs and how it shows a Christian iconography emerging.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John...\\nQuestion: What was done in order to minimize collateral damage in Kandahar in December of 1998?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

I gave 4/5 stars. My reasoning for the 4 stars was that the diagnosis was accurate and the service was good. However, I took off one star because in the time I was waiting, I had to use the restroom urgently, but couldn't find a mens room. There was only a womans restroom and an occupied all-gender restroom, so I ended up waiting ~20 min for someone to come out of the all-gender restroom. In the review I also left a comment where I suggested they make both restrooms all-gender rather than eliminating the men's room. I later received a condescending email from the GM of the dealership apologizing for me \\"being offended by change\\" and that he grew up in an era where men were courteous to women and that was his thought process when implementing the law required all-gender restroom. He also sent me a link to edit my review and basically told me that I could change the review if I wanted to, so I went back and changed it from 4/5 to 3/5 and also added that the GM was condescending. Was I an asshole to do that?","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning if it was appropriate to change their review and add that the General Motors was condescending.\\nIn the post, the author states that they recently received an email from a dealership asking for a review after receiving service. The author gave 4/5 stars and left a comment suggesting that both restrooms should be all-gender rather than just one of them. After doing so, they received an email from the General Motors (GM) of dealership where he apologized for \\"offending\\" them by making one restroom all-gender, which is required by law. He also included a link to edit their review if they wished to do so. The author changed their rating from 4/5 to 3/5 and added that GM was condescending in his response email.\\nBased on this information, we can infer that GM's response seems unprofessional and inappropriate since he stated in his email that customers could change their ratings as desired due to any reason whatsoever or even no reason at all (i.e., just because). This indicates behavior similar to payola where people are encouraged or incentivized for reviewing something favorably or unfavorably based on factors other than quality of service related to those reviews; this is unethical practice in general because it leads reviewers into giving responses not based on factors most relevant for ranking purposes but instead based on self-interests or other personal biases which are irrelevant from customer's perspective such as whether someone would receive free service (in case customer leaves positive feedback)  or credit towards some future purchases (in case customer leaves negative feedback). In addition, this also makes reviews less trustworthy since there is no way consumer can know how reliable these reviews really are since even consumers who leave unfavorable ratings may end up changing those ratings later due to receiving some incentive such as credits towards some future purchase(s).\\\\nBy changing his rating under these circumstances---which were likely artificially influenced---the consumer has acted ethically by leaving accurate rating without being unduly influenced by incentives offered by GM i.e., without being tricked into leaving more favorable rating than what he originally intended because GM offered him something in return had he left more favorable rating compared with what he originally intended; this action protects other potential consumers who may rely upon previous reviews when deciding whether certain product / service deserves consideration prior purchasing decision process; therefore , answer is \\"RIGHT\\"."},{"source":"Write the response.

Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences.\\n\\n- A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet.\\n\\n- Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek  (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from  (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\").\\n\\n- A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. \\n\\n- Recitative (also known by its Italian name \\"recitativo\\") is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition.\\n\\n- Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi (9 or 10 October 1813  27 January 1901) was an Italian opera composer.\\n\\n- A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. \\n\\n- Temistocle Solera (25 December 1815  21 April 1878) was an Italian opera composer and librettist.\\n\\n- Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.\\n\\n- A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral.\\n\\n- An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.\\n\\n- An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage facilities for costumes and set building. While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers.\\n\\n- Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter.\\n\\n- Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.\\n\\n- Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art.\\n\\n- A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir.\\n\\n- The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully.\\n\\n- An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods.\\n\\n- A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. \\n\\n- Oberto , Conte di San Bonifacio is an opera in two acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Temistocle Solera , based on an existing libretto by Antonio Piazza probably called Rocester . It was Verdi 's first opera , written over a period of four years and was first performed at the Teatro alla Scala , Milan , on 17 November 1839 . The La Scala production enjoyed \`\` a fair success '' and the theatre 's impresario , Bartolomeo Merelli , commissioned two further operas from the young composer .\\n\\n- Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode.\\n\\n- Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). \\nThe two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.\\n\\n- Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'oberto ' exhibits the relationship of 'genre'.

The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to \\"drop\\" (clear) again, as well as to fully condition—this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days.

Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon.

We both graduated in June and he went to college a little over and hour away from where we're from. \\n\\nMe and my others friends started boxing a couple of months ago and we've been sparring on the weekends. So I texted this particular friend and asked him if he would like to spar on the weekend. He said yes and I told him that he would have to buy handwraps and a mouthguard and he said that he could do that. We texted a little more about when we would pick him up from college and we decided that my brother and I would drive to his college which is an hour away on Friday, then when we got back to the town we're all from we would go to the store and buy all the stuff he needed and then spar at my house. \\n\\nSo come friday we drive up to his school, pick him up, and on the way back to where we're from he tells us he forgot his wallet. At this point we're like 10 minutes away from home so we decide we could do it the next day. Then later I'm on snapchat and see his story. He's at a party getting drunk and high with his other friends. I don't think much of because he's been my friend for 10 years why would he lie about something so insignificant. \\n\\nThe next day comes around and I text him and ask him if he was ready to be picked up and go to Dick's (sports store). He texts me back and says he's at a funeral and probably wouldn't be able to make it. \\n\\nAt this point I start thinking. So I check snapchat again and look at the snap map which is basically a gps tracker that tells you where your friends are. I look at it and it says he's in his way back to where he goes to school. So I text him and ask him if he's at the funeral right now. He texts me back and says yes. Then I ask him where the funeral is. He says it's in a town 40 minutes south of where we are from. Where he goes to school is an hour north of where we are from. So I begin to connect the dots and come to the conclusion that he is lying.

Something just wasn’t right.\\nActing on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies.\\nThe IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors.\\nIt was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out.

Vesey worked to gain freedom for his family; he tried to buy his wife but her master would not sell her. This meant their future children would also be born into slavery.

His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.\\nLess is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.\\nLochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....","target":"Lochner","rationale":"The question asks the last name of an individual to whom thirty-seven painting panels are attributed.

The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead.

POST : Posting on my throwaway because I don't want to risk this getting found by my SO.\\n\\nA little backstory which may or may not be relevant to your judgment.  Every single member of my extended family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc) has had at least one divorce.  My own mother married three times, each marriage lasting no longer than a few years.  We had to uproot our lives each time a marriage went sour and move to a new school district.  I'm a little disenchanted (and bitter) with the idea of marriage.  From my perspective, marriage just represents the beginning of the long drawn out process of death of a relationship, and potentially the ruin of lives.\\n\\nSee, my mom and my dad were perfectly happy before getting married, from the stories I've heard it was the best time of either one's lives.  Then they got married, had me, and split.  I don't know the full story of why this happened, and I don't really want to know, it's not my business. I was still a baby when they broke it off, so I never even got to develop the memory of a happy, whole family.  My earliest memories are of being handed off for visitation with my dad once every two weekends. After the divorce, my father was a broken man.  He was never truly happy again.  He remarried and stayed in that marriage for around 20 years but was never actually happy with his life.  Eventually he hit rock bottom, developed a meth habit, his wife left him, and he died penniless and a broken man.\\n\\nNow I'm a grown man, I've been with my SO for about a decade.  She has been dropping heavy hints (read: basically demanding) that she wants to get married.  I can't really blame her.  In the time that we've been together, I know several couples who have met, gotten married, and had children.  Her parents are still together and she didn't have the bitter experience I did growing up, so the idea of marriage is still sacred and magical to her.  Her mom recently was diagnosed with leukemia, which is under control, but it has really kindled my SO's desire to get married, so her mom can be present at the wedding.  Despite this, I'm still dragging my feet because it feels like I now have a time limit to do something I really don't see the point of.  I mean, does our relationship really mean anything less than a married couple's, just because they got the state to recognize their union?  We've been together 10 years, many (most?) marriages last way less than that.\\n\\nI haven't really opened up to her about how I feel about marriage, because I know it would probably break her heart to find out that I'm 100% apathetic to the idea.  So does this make me an asshole?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning whether or not they are an asshole for being apathetic to the idea of getting married, despite their girlfriend's interest in it.\\\\nIn the post, the author uses the past tense to describe what has happened to and how they feel about marriage within their family and community.

Atlanta scored first with a 55-yard catch and run from Matt Ryan to Roddy White.  The Eagles tied the score when McNabb capped off a long drive with a 3-yard quarterback draw for a touchdown.  Philadelphia drove down the field and scored on a 36-yard David Akers field goal in just 45 seconds before halftime.  The Eagles continued to roll on their opening possession of the third quarter, scoring on a 16-yard run by Brian Westbrook to open up a 17-7 lead.  Atlanta drove to the Philadelphia 1-yard line in the third quarter, but Lito Sheppard intercepted a fade to the end zone.  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia's offense failed to capitalize on yet another goal line situation, and instead settled for a field goal, giving Atlanta hope.  The Falcons responded with an impressive drive that ended in a touchdown pass to Roddy White, making it 20-14.  The Eagles went three and out and punted, but the officials ruled the punt was muffed by Adam Jennings and recovered by the Eagles.  Atlanta, out of timeouts, could not challenge the controversial call, and two plays later Westbrook broke a 39-yard touchdown to the left side to put the game away.  Westbrook rushed for 167 yards and two touchdowns and had 42 receiving yards.  McNabb had 253 passing yards and also ran for 25 yards.

Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

Anti-Kre2p/Mntlp antibodies identify a 60-kD integral membrane protein that is progressively N-glycosylated in an MNNl-dependent manner. Kre2p/Mntlp is localized in a Golgi compartment that overlaps with that containing the medial-Golgi mannosyltransferase Mnnlp, and distinct from that including the late Golgi protein Kexlp. To determine which regions of Kre2p/Mntlp are required for Golgi localization, Kre2p/Mntlp mutant proteins were assem-bled by substitution of Kre2p domains with equivalent sequences from the vacuolar proteins DPAP B and Pho8p. Chimeric proteins were tested for correct topology, in vitro and in vivo activity, and were localized intracellularly by indirect immunofluorescence. The resuits demonstrate that the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain is necessary for correct Kre2p Golgi localization whereas, the membrane-spanning and stem domains are dispensable. However, in a test of targeting sufficiency, the presence of the entire Kre2p cytoplasmic tail, plus the transmembrane domain and a 36-amino acid residue luminal stem region was required to localize a Pho8p reporter protein to the yeast Golgi. T HE Golgi apparatus plays a fundamental role in glycan processing and sorting of newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. The Golgi apparatus of a typical mammalian cell is composed of a polarized stack of membranous saccules that are differentiated into functionally distinct subcompartments. After the addition of core N-linked sugar moieties in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycoproteins proceed through the cis-Golgi network, the cis-, medial-, and transcisternae, and the trans-Golgi network, where further modifications take place. These include the addition of O-linked sugars and the elaboration, in a protein-specific manner, of complex N-linked carbohydrate structures. The Golgi apparatus also constitutes a major organelle responsible for protein trafficking where particular proteins are directed to precise cellular locations. Two specific Golgi subcompartments have been found to be involved in protein sorting. The cis-Golgi network constitutes the site from which many resident ER proteins are retrieved, and the main function of the TGN is to direct glycoproteins exiting the Golgi complex to either the lysosome or the cell surface ( \\n Title: Localization and Targeting of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kre2p/Mnt lp oL 1,2-Mannosyltransferase to a medial.Gol Compartment","target":"False","rationale":"In the paragraph, there is no detailed description of how the localization and targeting of Kre2p/Mntlp is achieved.

Here, we describe tumor-induced alterations of the host metabolic response to caloric deficiency that cause intratumoral immune suppression. In pre-cachectic mice with transplanted colorectal cancer or autochthonous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), we find that IL-6 reduces the hepatic ketogenic potential through suppression of PPARalpha, the transcriptional master regulator of ketogenesis. When these mice are challenged with caloric deficiency, the resulting relative hypoketonemia triggers a marked rise in glucocorticoid levels. Multiple intratumoral immune pathways are suppressed by this hormonal stress response. Moreover, administering corticosterone to elevate plasma corticosterone to a level that is lower than that occurring in cachectic mice abolishes the response of mouse PDA to an immunotherapy that has advanced to clinical trials. Therefore, tumor-induced IL-6 impairs the ketogenic response to reduced caloric intake, resulting in a systemic metabolic stress response that blocks anti-cancer immunotherapy.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract is not structured: it does not include a topic sentence that provides the main idea, relevant supporting sentences that provide evidence and background information to support the main idea, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings or conclusions.

Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.\\n\\n- Matija Klukovi (born May 4, 1982 in Zagreb, Croatia) is a young Croatian independent film director.

KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995.

Unlike text however, music relies heavily on repetition on multiple timescales to build structure and meaning. The Music Transformer has shown compelling results in generating music with structure (Huang et al., 2018).   In this paper, we introduce a tool for visualizing self-attention on polyphonic music with an interactive pianoroll.   We use music transformer as both a descriptive tool and a generative model.   For the former, we use it to analyze existing music to see if the resulting self-attention structure corroborates with the musical structure known from music theory.   For the latter, we inspect the model's self-attention during generation, in order to understand how past notes affect future ones. We also compare and contrast the attention structure of regular attention to that of relative attention (Shaw et al., 2018, Huang et al., 2018), and examine its impact on the resulting generated music.   For example, for the JSB Chorales dataset, a model trained with relative attention is more consistent in attending to all the voices in the preceding timestep and the chords before, and at cadences to the beginning of a phrase, allowing it to create an arc.   We hope that our analyses will offer more evidence for relative self-attention as a powerful inductive bias for modeling music.

By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march.

This suggests that there is some kind of historical context in relation to this march. The Jarrow March (also known as the 'Jarrow Crusade') took place in 1936 and was organized by local people who were calling for jobs after their ship-building industry closed down. There is further mention of Labour leaders such as Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock associating themselves with the event in different decades since its occurrence, i.e., from 1950 onwards into more recent times like 1986 on occasion of 50th anniversary celebrations .

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

Bentley (born 1931, Rochester, New York) is an American glaciologist and geophysicist. He is a professor emeritus at the University of WisconsinMadison. Mount Bentley and the Bentley Subglacial Trench in Antarctica are named after him. In 1957, he and a handful of other scientists including Mario Giovinetto set out on an expedition across West Antarctica in tracked vehicles to make the first measurements of the ice sheet.\\n\\n- The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.\\n\\n- Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd, Jr., USN (October 25, 1888  March 11, 1957) was an American naval officer who specialized in feats of exploration. He was a recipient of the Medal of Honor, the highest honor for valor given by the United States, and was a pioneering American aviator, polar explorer, and organizer of polar logistics. Aircraft flights in which he served as a navigator and expedition leader crossed the Atlantic Ocean, a segment of the Arctic Ocean, and a segment of the Antarctic Plateau. Byrd claimed that his expeditions had been the first to reach both the North Pole and the South Pole by air. However, his claim to have reached the North Pole is disputed.\\n\\n- The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest ice shelf of Antarctica (an area of roughly and about across: about the size of France). It is several hundred metres thick. The nearly vertical ice front to the open sea is more than long, and between high above the water surface. Ninety percent of the floating ice, however, is below the water surface.\\n\\n- The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) is a federal body within the United States Geological Survey, an agency of the Department of the Interior. The purpose of the board is to establish and maintain uniform usage of geographic names throughout the federal government of the United States.\\n\\n- The Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is the segment of the continental ice sheet that covers West (or Lesser) Antarctica, the portion of Antarctica on the side of the Transantarctic Mountains which lies in the Western Hemisphere. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies well below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.\\n\\n- Eights Coast is that portion of the coast of West Antarctica between Cape Waite and Pfrogner Point. To the west is the Walgreen Coast of Marie Byrd Land, and to the east is Bryan Coast. It is part of Ellsworth Land and stretches between 103°24'W and 89°35'W. This coast is bordered by Thurston Island, Abbot Ice Shelf and some islands within the ice shelf, and for most of its length washed by Bellingshausen Sea, and west of Thurston Island by Amundsen Sea. Most of Eights Coast is not claimed by any nation, like Marie Byrd Land, the large region west of it. Only in the east, Eights Coast touches the sector claimed by Chile as part of its southernmost province. Peter I Island, 450 km north of the coast, is claimed by Norway as a dependency.\\n\\n- The Echelmeyer Ice Stream, formerly known as Ice Stream F, is a glaciological feature of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is an ice stream flowing west to the Shirase Coast to the north of the MacAyeal Ice Stream, and is one of several major ice streams draining from Marie Byrd Land into the Ross Ice Shelf. The ice streams were investigated and mapped by U.S. Antarctic Research Program personnel in a number of field seasons from 198384 and originally named Ice Stream A, B, C, etc., according to their position from south to north.\\n\\n- The Bay of Whales was a natural ice harbor, or \\"iceport\\", indenting the front of Ross Ice Shelf just north of Roosevelt Island, Antarctica.

It is one of several major ice streams draining from Marie Byrd Land into the Ross Ice Shelf. The ice streams were investigated and mapped by U.S. Antarctic Research Program personnel in a number of field seasons from 198384 onwards and named Ice Stream A, B, C, etc., according to their position from south to north. The name was changed from Ice Scream E by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 2002 to honor Douglas R.

It was named by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1961 for Laurence M. Gould, a geologist who was second-in-command of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 192830. Gould led the Geological Party which in 1929 mapped of this coast. While president of Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, he was appointed Chairman of the U.S. National Committee for the International Geophysical Year and took a prominent part in planning the United States research program for Antarctica.\\n\\n- Marie Byrd Land is the portion of West Antarctica lying east of the Ross Ice Shelf and the Ross Sea and south of the Pacific Ocean, extending eastward approximately to a line between the head of the Ross Ice Shelf and Eights Coast. It stretches between 158°W and 103°24'W. The inclusion of the area between the Rockefeller Plateau and Eights Coast is based upon the leading role of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd in the exploration of this area. The name was originally applied by Admiral Byrd in 1929, in honor of his wife, to the northwestern part of the area, the part that was explored in that year.\\n\\n- Shirase Coast is the north segment of the relatively ill-defined coast along the east side of Ross Ice Shelf and Ross Sea, lying between the north end of Siple Coast (about ) and Cape Colbeck. Named by NZ-APC in 1961 after Lieutenant Nobu Shirase (1861-1946), leader of the Japanese expedition, whose ship \\"Kainan Maru\\" sailed near this coast in January 1912. Landings were made at Kainan Bay and at the Bay of Whales, the origin of a 160-mile journey southeast on Ross Ice Shelf. From (off Edward VII Peninsula), another party landed for a sledge trip to the edge of the Queen Alexandra Range.\\n\\n- Bentley Subglacial Trench is a vast topographic trench in Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica, 80°S, 115°W. At 2,555 meters (8,382 ft) below sea level, it is the lowest point on the surface of the earth not covered by ocean, although it is covered by ice. Normally, it is not counted as the lowest point on land, since the overlying ice sheet makes it essentially subterranean. (See Extremes on Earth and Vestfold Hills) Also, if the ice melted, the area would be under water. \\n\\n- The Rockefeller Plateau in Antarctica is that portion of the interior ice plateau of Marie Byrd Land lying eastward of Shirase Coast and Siple Coast and southward of the Ford Ranges, Flood Range and Executive Committee Range, centering near the coordinates given above. Much of its extensive, ice-covered surface is from 1,000 to 1,500 m above sea level. It was discovered by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, in 1934, and named for John D. Rockefeller, Jr., patron of the Byrd expeditions.\\n\\n- The University of WisconsinMadison (also known as University of Wisconsin, Wisconsin, UW, or regionally as UWMadison, or simply Madison) is a public research university in Madison, Wisconsin, United States. Founded when Wisconsin achieved statehood in 1848, UWMadison is the official state university of Wisconsin, and the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System. It was the first public university established in Wisconsin and remains the oldest and largest public university in the state. It became a land-grant institution in 1866. The main campus includes four National Historic Landmarks.\\n\\n- Siple Coast is the middle portion of the relatively ill-defined coast along the east side of the Ross Ice Shelf, between the north end of Gould Coast and the south end of Shirase Coast.

Some factions advocated Protestant doctrines, renouncing the development of doctrine through tradition and instead emphasising private interpretation of scripture. Against these and other liberal religious factions, the Oxford Movement, of which Newman was a leading member, advocated a Catholic interpretation of the Church of England, claiming that the Church and its traditions were authoritative. Amongst all of these thinkers, however, the Roman Catholic Church was despised as having abdicated its claim to doctrinal authority by introducing superstition into its practice. Accordingly, when Newman converted to Roman Catholicism in 1845, he met with vehement criticism. In Loss and Gain, Newman's first publication after his conversion, he expressed the intellectual and emotional development that led him to Roman Catholicism and the response his conversion elicited. Newman was in his 40s and was an esteemed theologian at the time of his conversion, but in the novel he displaces his experience onto Charles Reding, a young student entering Oxford and experiencing its intellectual climate for the first time. Although Charles attempts to follow a conventional path and avoid being influenced by \\"parties\\" (i.e. cliques advocating trendy sectarian views), he soon discovers that he is inclined towards Roman Catholicism. He struggles against this inclination but eventually decides he must convert, a decision that causes great consternation to his family and friends but leads to personal fulfilment.Charles Reding arrives at Oxford University planning to follow the advice and example of his father, and to submit to the teachings of the Church of England without becoming involved in any factious parties. Reding is inclined towards a form of Latitudinarianism, following the maxim \\"Measure people by what they are, and not by what they are not.\\" His conversations with his friend Sheffield convince him, however, that there must be right and wrong answers in doctrinal matters. To follow the right views, Reding seeks a source of Church authority, and is disappointed to find only party dissension and the Protestant doctrine of Private Judgment, which locates interpretive authority in the individual and thereby leads (in Newman's view) to the espousal of contradictory views. Furthermore, Reding begins to have doubts about the Thirty-nine Articles, to which he must subscribe to take his degree. His doubts are briefly dispelled following the death of his father, but return soon afterward. In particular, several brief encounters with Willis, a former Oxford peer who converted to Roman Catholicism, greatly excite and trouble him. Suspicious of his speculations, Jennings forces Reding to live away from Oxford while studying for his exams, so as not to corrupt other students. Reding confesses his doubts to his sister Mary, who does not understand them and loses trust in her brother. When Reding finally decides he must convert, Mary, his mother, and several family friends express resentment and anger. He travels to London, on the way receiving encouragement from a Catholic priest (perhaps Newman himself), the first he has ever met. While in London Reding is confronted by emissaries from various religious and philosophical sects who, hearing about his departure from the Anglican Church, want to recruit him for their own causes. Ultimately, however, Reding arrives at the Passionists Convent, where he joins the Roman Catholic Church.","target":"When were the religious tensions occurring at Oxford University?","rationale":"The story's summary provides information about religious tensions during the 1840s at Oxford University.

Her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) argued that urban renewal did not respect the needs of city-dwellers. It also introduced the sociological concepts \\"eyes on the street\\" and \\"social capital\\". Jacobs organized grassroots efforts to protect neighborhoods from \\"slum clearance\\", in particular Robert Moses' plans to overhaul her own Greenwich Village neighborhood.\\nContext: In 1935, during the Great Depression, she moved to New York City with her sister Betty. Jane Butzner took an immediate liking to Manhattan's Greenwich Village, which did not conform to the city's grid structure. The sisters soon moved there from Brooklyn.  During her early years in the city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs working as a stenographer and freelance writer, writing about working districts in the city. These experiences, she later said, \\"... gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like, what work was like.\\" Her first job was for a trade magazine as a secretary, then an editor. She sold articles to the Sunday Herald Tribune, Cue magazine, and Vogue.  She studied at Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, taking courses in geology, zoology, law, political science, and economics. About the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests, she said:  For the first time I liked school and for the first time I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the property of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.\\nQuestion: What did they do.

Please forgive me as this is literally my first reddit post, ever.\\n        Back in high school, I never really had any girlfriends. I was starting to exhibit some incel “nice guy” traits that I’ve since been really embarrassed about, and it was a very awkward time for me. After having had crushes on a lot of girls and being denied every single time, I had essentially lost hope of being in a relationship/ having my first kiss, or whatever in high school. That is, until, this girl came along... we’ll call her B. \\n        I had a science class with B and from the first day we really hit it off, she was engaging me, trying to talk with me, and it seemed like flirting a little bit. Now being a “nice guy” I never knew what it was like for a girl to flirt with me, and I took all female interaction as a sign that they wanted to date me. However, having had a really tough time with my previous crush, I really didn’t want it to happen again, so I actively resisted talking to B or even being near her, but she persisted, and brought me closer to her, which made me fall in love with her... big leap, I know, and boy was that a mistake. \\n        At first we started with just friendly conversation in class, and eventually she DM’ed me on a group chat app, and we started talking for about two weeks or so. It was about this time that I learned that she broke up with her previous boyfriend, sometime after the school year began. It was someone she didn’t particularly like, and someone who often played with her feelings and emotions. But, she got back together with him about a week after we started talking. She was still talking to me, being somewhat flirtatious, and suddenly one day, B asked me a question: Do you like me? The answer was yes, and I asked her the same question, and her answer was also yes. \\n         She told me she wasn’t happy in her relationship, and she didn’t want to be with her boyfriend anymore. But, she didn’t break up with him. In fact, she outright refused to. I figured she was afraid of something... or really just didn’t want to for one reason or another. But nevertheless, she said she liked me, and she wanted to be with me, so I hung on. She confided in me, talked about her problems in life and with her boyfriend, which were numerous, and I was there for her when she felt like nobody else was. \\n         Eventually, she started phasing me out of her life, she started ignoring my texts, talking to me less and less, not engaging me in conversations, both over text and in person. I would invite her to choir concerts (I as well as multiple others in choir were friends with her) and she refused to go. I would try to reach out to her, and she would ignore me. Then, five months after getting back together with her boyfriend, he broke up with her. \\n         She was totally destroyed, and I was there to pick up the pieces, and help her through a terrible depression that she was going through. About a month later, I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, and she said no. She said that she still hadn’t healed from the break up, and that she didn’t just want to use me as a rebound, she wanted to have a “meaningful relationship with me” which I thought was perfectly reasonable at the time, although I was impatient. \\n          Around that time, I had really bad depression and anxiety, so I started reaching out more to my choir friends, and eventually found a group that I could confide in. We called ourselves AIDS (Anxiety, Depression, Insecurities Squad) it’s cringey I know. I had a good friend in there since freshman year, named R. R had told me, in a group hang out, that about a week after I asked her out, B had drunkenly “hit up” R. R knowing that I had a massive crush on B, politely declined, and B apologized the day after. However, I was devastated. \\n          I was totally offended that she “hit up” another guy when she said she had feelings for me and I had feelings for her. It’s not that I wanted her to “hit me up” it’s that in doing so, she totally invalidated my feelings towards her, and the fact that she said she had feelings for me. I felt totally betrayed, and I felt like she had taken advantage of me during the time that I knew her. In my eyes, she simply used me as an emotional crutch, confiding in me because she wasn’t being emotionally fulfilled in her current relationship, so she went elsewhere to me. I thought, that instead of just telling me she didn’t like me, she lied to keep me around. \\n           I confronted her with this, and it went about as well as you’d expect, and she accused me of only wanting to have a sexual relationship with her, which couldn’t have been farther from the truth. In her defense, she was drunk when she did it, and she apologized. And we weren’t dating, so she had no responsibility to tell me what happened, or even that it did happen. Nevertheless, our friendship pretty much ended after that, and it nearly drove me to suicide, I’m ashamed to admit. \\n          We haven’t spoken after that, although she tried to friend me on Snapchat one day, and I denied the request. \\n          Currently, I’m in a happy relationship with my girlfriend who was there to help me after B and I had the falling out. She’s the most wonderful, beautiful person in the world. I often think about B, and I get very anxious remembering the pain I suffered from that whole ordeal, and it weighs on my mind often. \\n          So, am I the asshole for getting offended? Did I ruin the friendship?\\n\\nTL:DR - A girl I liked said she liked me, but wouldn’t break up with her boyfriend. I gave her a lot of emotional support. When she did, she said she didn’t want to get together because she was still hurt from the break up, but “hit up” one of my good friends. I felt like she used me as an emotional crutch, and she thinks I only wanted to have sex with her.","target":"EVERYBODY","rationale":"The author describes how they were in a relationship with someone who was still in another relationship.

Bob Hewison signed Williams in May 1939 for Bristol City without making the first team in the three league matches in the truncated 1939–40 season. Williams played as a guest for Reading and Tottenham Hotspur during the Second World War. During the 1939–1945 war time Williams also made 53 appearances scoring 21 goals in regional league matches, 13 appearances scoring 6 goals in other leagues and 28 appearances scoring 11 goals in war time cup competitions for Bristol City. Cyril Williams continued his career for Bristol City after the war. Cyril Williams finally made his League debut at inside left in a 3–4 defeat at Aldershot on 31 August 1946 at the age of 24 years. When Bristol City finished 3rd in the Division Three South Williams made 41 appearances, missing only one match, scoring 17 goals including a hat-trick in the 3–1 win at Mansfield Town on 17 May 1947. Williams was part of a goalscoring forward trio of Bill Thomas 14 goals and Don Clark a record 36 goals as Bristol City were highest scorers in the Division with 94 goals. The following season inside right Len Townsend joined from Brentford F.C. scoring 31 goals, Clark netted 22 goals and Willams 10 goals from 37 appearances. This trio scored 63 of the 77 League goals in 1947–48. Williams also scored an FA Cup hat-trick in a 9–2 win v Dartford in a 1st round replay on 6 December 1947. Townsend & Clark also scored hat-tricks v Dartford in the same game. In June 1948 Cyril Williams moved to West Bromwich Albion in exchange for Cliff Edwards plus £500. There was thunderous wrath among \\"Robins\\" fans at the sale of their ball playing schemer with the silky skills who had been the creative force behind the ascent up the Third Division South table since the war. West Bromwich Albion finished as runners up in the Second Division in 1948–49 with Williams making 31 appearances scoring 9 goals including another hat-trick in a 5–2 win v Grimsby Town on 11 December 1948. Williams also played in all 4 FA Cup ties as West Brom reached the 6th round losing 0–1 at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Playing in the First Division in 1949–50 Williams made 26 appearances scoring 8 goals. After 14 appearances scoring two goals in 1950–51 for West Brom Cyril Williams moved back to Bristol City in August 1951 for £4,500. Williams scored on his return in a 3–1 win v Newport County on 18 August 1951. He played in both inside forward and wing half positions in making 39 appearances scoring 6 goals in 1951–52. The following season Bristol City rose to 5th place in the Third Division South, near neighbours Bristol Rovers finished as champions, Williams made 42 appearances outscoring John Atyeo with 17 goals including a hat-trick in a 5–0 win v Crystal Palace on 13 September 1952. In 1953–54 Williams played first at left half then at inside left making 39 appearances scoring 4 goals with Bristol City rising to 3rd place. When Bristol City won promotion as Third Division South champions in 1954–55 Williams again made 39 appearances scoring 4 goals starting at inside left and ending as left half. In 1955–56 in the Second Division Williams played regularly as left half making 34 appearances and 3 goals. The following season in 1956–57 Williams made 22 appearances scoring 8 goals but only made 3 appearances in his final season at Bristol City in 1957–58.\\n Passage 2:The keel for Wacht was laid down in August 1886 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. She was launched on 27 August 1887 and Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Alexander von Monts, the chief of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station) christened the ship. In early 1888, she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven, where her armament was installed, and she was commissioned on 9 August to begin sea trials. These concluded on 13 December in Wilhelmshaven. She was temporarily assigned to the newly-created Reserve Division of the North Sea over the winter of 1888–1889 before being transferred to Kiel on 1 May to begin engine trials, after which she was assigned to the Maneuver Squadron. During training exercises with the squadron, Wacht suffered a burst boiler tube on 20 June that forced her to return to port for repairs. In early August, she joined the squadron for a visit to Britain, arriving back in Wilhelmshaven on 31 August. The fleet then conducted its annual large-scale maneuvers. After the maneuvers ended in September, Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette Captain) Friedrich von Baudissin took command of the vessel. \\n Passage 3:Born in 1941, Belanger attended public schools in Bristol, Connecticut. He has degrees from Haverford College (A.B., 1963) and from Columbia University (M.A., 1964; Ph.D., 1970), where he studied under James L. Clifford, Allen T. Hazen, and John H. Middendorf. Between 1966 and 1971, while working on his dissertation on aspects of the 18th-century London book trade, he taught advanced prose composition courses at the Columbia University School of General Studies, an activity leading to the 1972 publication of The Art of Persuasion, a writing manual co-authored with J. Steward LaCasce. While in England on a Columbia traveling fellowship in 1968–69, he revised the book production sections of the 18th-century volume of the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL), working with Graham Pollard, who had compiled the original sections for the first edition of CBEL, published in 1940. With Jane Marla Robbins, he co-authored and co-directed a one-character play starring Robbins called Dear Nobody, based on the life of the 18th-century diarist and novelist, Fanny Burney. The play ran Off-Off-Broadway in 1968; it later had a five-months' Off-Broadway run at the Cherry Lane Theatre in 1974.","target":"3","rationale":"The only passage which contains information about Belanger's teaching career is Passage 3.

The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \\"Popish Plot\\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason. After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.\\nWhich happened first, the Rye House Plot of 1683 or the accession of James II and his coronation at Westminster Abbey?","target":"Rye House Plot of 1683","rationale":"The Rye House Plot of 1683 happened before the accession of James II and his coronation at Westminster Abbey in April 1685."},{"source":"In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the general math.

Then, we have: 4x+3y+2z = 1170\\\\nWe know that 4x = 2(2x), so we can subtract 2z from both sides of the equation to get: 2z + 3y = 1170 - 2(2x) = 1170 - 4x\\\\nSince 3y is greater than or equal to 0 for all values of y, we can add \\\\(4x\\\\) to both sides of this equation without changing the value on the left hand side. This gives us:\\\\n6y + 4x=1170-4x+4*X=1170\\\\nNow divide both sides by 6:\\\\ny + (\\\\\\\\frac{2}{3}) * x=195\\nFrom these equations we have:\\\\nz=(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{2})*(1170-(4*X)-(3*Y))=(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{2})*(1170-4*X-(3/6)(1170))=(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{12})(2340-8X)\\nTherefore z grows faster than x and y as X increases since X is multiplied by a larger number in its equation while Z has only half as much weight. So Z must stay relatively small compared to X and Y unless X is very small. So it makes sense that Z would be less than Y which would be less then X.

It is therefore expected that prebiotics will improve health in a way similar to probiotics, whilst at the same time being cheaper, and carrying less risk and being easier to incorporate into the diet than probiotics.    AIM To review published evidence for prebiotic effects on gut function and human health.   \\n METHODS We searched the Science Citation Index with the terms prebiotic, microbiota, gut bacteria, large intestine, mucosa, bowel habit, constipation, diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, calcium and cancer, focussing principally on studies in humans and reports in the English language. Search of the Cochrane Library did not identify any clinical study or meta-analysis on this topic.   \\n RESULTS Three prebiotics, oligofructose, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose, clearly alter the balance of the large bowel microbiota by increasing bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus numbers. These carbohydrates are fermented and give rise to short-chain fatty acid and intestinal gas; however, effects on bowel habit are relatively small. Randomized-controlled trials of their effect in a clinical context are few, although animal studies show anti-inflammatory effects in inflammatory bowel disease, while calcium absorption is increased.   \\n CONCLUSIONS It is still early days for prebiotics, but they offer the potential to modify the gut microbial balance in such a way as to bring direct health benefits cheaply and safely.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the purpose of the study (\\"AIM To review published evidence for prebiotic effects on gut function and human health.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe previous studies conducted to investigate this question, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions from these studies.

In addition, Germany are the only team which has stood on the podium (3rd place or better) every decade there was a tournament held--1930s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Along with Argentina, Brazil and Spain, they are one of the four national teams to win outside their continental confederation, with the title of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in South America. The team was present in 19 out of the 21 tournaments, the second most frequent, and only did not reach the quarterfinals twice, in 1938 and 2018. With this, Germany's 8th place or better (quarterfinals) in 17 out of 19 tournaments (89%) ranks highest in FIFA World Cup Finals history. It makes Germany the better team in the history of the tournament in terms of final positions, if points were awarded proportionally for a title, runner-up finish, third-place finish, semi-final and quarter-final appearances.\\n\\nAnswer the following yes/no question: did germany get out of the world cup?

Passage 1:Samuel was offered the chance to join Greenock Morton of the Scottish Championship on loan on transfer deadline day at the start of September 2015, an offer he stated he \\"knew straight away\\" that he wanted to take. He signed a four-month loan contract with Morton, with the deal running until January 2016. He made his Morton debut as a 78th-minute substitute for Romario Sabajo in a 4–2 away victory at Livingston on 5 September. Samuel became a regular in the first-team for Morton almost immediately, scoring his first two goals for the club in a 3–2 extra-time Scottish League Cup win over Motherwell at Cappielow in his fourth appearance for the club. His first goal in the match came courtesy of a sweeping effort in the first-half, before netting the winning goal in the 100th-minute with a first-time finish from a low cross. Samuel scored his first Scottish League goal in the Renfrewshire derby, scoring the equalising goal from close range in a 1–1 draw away at St Mirren on 20 November 2015. He added a fourth goal to his tally for the season on 18 December 2015 when he scored midway through the first half to briefly give Morton the lead in an eventual 2–1 home defeat to Raith Rovers. In January 2016, his loan deal was extended for the rest of the 2015–16 season. A month later, he briefly returned to Swansea to receive treatment after sustaining a knee injury in a Development League West match against Queen's Park. The injury ultimately ruled Samuel out of action for a month, before returning to the Morton first-team as a late substitute in a 3–2 win over Queen of the South on 15 March 2016. He went on to feature largely from the substitute's bench for the remainder of the season, making 30 appearances and scoring four goals in all competitions during his time at Morton, with the club finishing in fifth place in the Scottish Championship.\\n Passage 2:Born in Richmond, California, Pro received an Associate of Arts degree from Contra Costa Community College in 1966, a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Francisco State University in 1968, and a Juris Doctor from Golden Gate University School of Law in 1972. He served in the United States Naval Reserve from 1964 to 1968. After serving as a law clerk to Judge William P. Compton of the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada from 1972 to 1973, Pro worked as a deputy public defender in Las Vegas, Nevada from 1973 to 1975. He was an Assistant United States Attorney in Las Vegas from 1975 to 1978. He was in private practice in Reno, Nevada from 1978 to 1979. He was a deputy state attorney general of Nevada from 1979 to 1980. He was the Chief Assistant United States Attorney in Reno in 1980. He served as a United States Magistrate Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada from 1980 to 1987.\\n Passage 3:He graduated from Yale College in 1808. He commenced a course of legal studies in the office of Hon. Lyman Law, of New London, but soon altered his plans. He then taught in the Academy at Plainfield, Conn., and there studied theology with Rev. Joel Benedict, D. D. He was licensed to preach by the New London County Association, Sept. 24, 1811, and supplied several congregations in Vermont and elsewhere. After about six months at the Andover Theological Seminary, in the class of 1814, he was ordained Pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Plattsburg, N. Y., July 5, 1815, and dismissed Oct. 2,1817, being driven southward by the severity of the climate. In Jan. 1818. he was installed over the First Congregational Church in Fairfield, Conn., as successor of Rev. Dr. Heman Humphrey. While in this charge, he became prominent as an able Temperance advocate, and in 1827 he labored extensively in behalf of the American Temperance Society, formed the year before in Boston. In Nov., he was appointed to a three years mission for this Society, and was accordingly dismissed from his pastorate, Dec. 18. His successful efforts during this time, well entitled him to be called the \\"Luther of the early Temperance Reformation.\\" Dec. 1, 1830, he was installed over the Second Congregational Church in Bridgeport, Conn., a parish adjacent to his former one. The summer of 1831 was spent in England and Paris, on the errand of the Temperance Reform. In 1833, Dr. Hewit (he received the degree of D. D. from Amherst in 1830) was prominent among the founders of the East Windsor Theological Institute, now the Hartford Seminary. In 1853 a difference in his Society, in regard to the course to be taken in procuring assistance for the pastor, resulted in his withdrawal, and the formation of an Old School Presbyterian Church over which he was installed Oct. 31.

Such methods are appealing for capability on large-scale sparse datasets. On top of that, they are computationally efficient and insensitive to the hyper-parameter settings. In this paper, we present a new framework for adapting Adam-typed methods, namely AdamT. Instead of applying a simple exponential weighted average, AdamT also includes the trend information when updating the parameters with the adaptive step size and gradients. The newly added term is expected to efficiently capture the non-horizontal moving patterns on the cost surface, and thus converge more rapidly. We show empirically the importance of the trend component, where AdamT outperforms the conventional Adam method constantly in both convex and non-convex settings.","target":"We present a new framework for adapting Adam-typed methods, namely AdamT, to include the trend information when updating the parameters with the adaptive step size and gradients","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe present a new framework for adapting Adam-typed methods, namely AdamT, to include the trend information when updating the parameters with the adaptive step size and gradients."},{"source":"You are provided with a list of converations between a \\"USER\\" and \\"ASSISTANT\\".

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership.

The partial expiratory flow volume curves in the infants with BPD were markedly concave, with tidal breathing approaching expiratory flow limitation. The infants with BPD had significantly (P less than 0.01) lower absolute and size-corrected flows than did control infants, and 50% of the infants with BPD required rehospitalization because of acute respiratory distress associated with a lower respiratory tract illness. In addition, the slope of the linear regression of maximal expiratory flow at FRC (in milliliters per second) vs length (in centimeters) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) for the infants with BPD than for normal control infants (2.25 vs 4.52), indicating poor growth of the airways. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 was negatively correlated with maximal expiratory flow at FRC, indicating that measurement of SaO2 alone may not be sufficient in the evaluation of lung function in infants with BPD. We conclude that, although infants with BPD improve clinically during the first year of life, they have abnormal functional airway growth; the decreased expiratory flow reserve helps to explain their high risk for acute respiratory distress during lower respiratory tract illness. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes a lot of numerical values, including measurements of the functional residual capacity (FRC), partial expiratory flow volume curves, absolute and size-corrected flows, oxygen saturation values, and lengths.

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory.

Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed before hospital discharge and then serially at regular intervals over the following year. In addition, 24 hr Holter monitoring was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction was determined. Sixty-five patients (group 1) had abnormal signal-averaged ECGs (voltage in the last 40 msec of the filtered QRS less than 20 microV or filtered QRS duration greater than 120 msec), 92 had normal signal-averaged ECGs (group 2), and eight had bundle branch block (excluded from analysis). In group 1, spontaneous normalization of the voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS complex occurred in 30% of patients after 12 months, although total filtered QRS duration did not change overall. During follow-up of up to 20 months (median 11), seven patients died suddenly and six presented again with spontaneous, symptomatic VT. Eleven of 65 (17%) group 1 patients had an arrhythmic event compared with one of 92 patients (1%) in group 2 (p less than .001). The sensitivity of the signal-averaged ECG as a predictor of arrhythmic events was 92% with a specificity of 62%. Patients with subsequent arrhythmic events had considerably lower voltage in the last 40 msec of the QRS (11.0 +/- 8.3 vs 32.0 +/- 21.9 microV; p less than .001) than those without such events, and longer filtered QRS complexes (121 +/- 14 vs 105 +/- 12 msec; p less than .001). Multivariate logistic regression determined that the signal-averaged ECG provided independent prognostic information from the presence of complex ventricular ectopy and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction assessed at the time of hospital discharge. Signal-averaged ECGs provide important prognostic information in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. Dynamic changes in the terminal QRS voltage are observed during the first year after myocardial infarction.","target":"Comparative Study","rationale":"This paper compares signal-averaged ECGs and Holter monitoring as predictors of arrhythmic events in patients who have survived an acute myocardial infarction.

After a short punt in the second quarter, the Niners scored a second touchdown, but Chicago answered with their first touchdown just before halftime. To start the third quarter, the Niners held the ball for more than nine minutes. But they once again failed in the red zone, and settled for another field goal.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \\"Celtic\\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \\"Celtic art\\" only from the La Tene period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.\\nContext: From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the Picts is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts. The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including Iona, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south. After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced Pictish art, with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones.  Pictish stones are assigned by scholars to 3 classes. Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the Pictish Beast, and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror). The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others. This is often taken to symbolise a woman. Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east Scotland from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. Good examples include the Dunnichen and Aberlemno stones (Angus), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones (Aberdeenshire).  Class II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces. The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the Insular style. On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes. Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so. The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures. Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology. Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle (Perthshire), Aberlemno (Angus), Nigg, Shandwick and Hilton of Cadboll (Easter Ross).  Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols. Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, Perthshire). These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century. Examples include the sarcophagus and the large collection of cross-slabs at St Andrews (Fife).  The following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle (Perthshire), St Vigeans (Angus) and St Andrew's Cathedral (Fife) (all Historic Scotland), the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, Forfar (Angus), Inverness Museum, Groam House Museum, Rosemarkie and Tarbat Discovery Centre, Portmahomack (both Easter Ross) and Tankerness House Museum, Kirkwall, Orkney.\\nQuestion: What else is significant about Picts?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century.","rationale":"The context states \\"Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols.

We investigated the role of Cdk5 activity in the subcellular localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5. Cdk5 activity affected the localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5 through phosphorylation of p35 or p39. Using unphosphorylated or phosphomimetic mutants of p35 and p39, we found that phosphorylation at Ser8, common to p35 and p39, by Cdk5 regulated the cytoplasmic localization and perinuclear accumulation of unphosphorylated S8A mutants, and whole cytoplasmic distribution of phosphomimetic S8E mutants. Cdk5 activity was necessary to retain Cdk5-activator complexes in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, small but distinct amounts of p35 and p39 were detected in the nucleus. In particular, nuclear p35 and p39 were increased when the Cdk5 activity was inhibited. p39 had a greater propensity to accumulate in the nucleus than p35, and phosphorylation at Thr84, specific to p39, regulated the potential nuclear localization activity of the Lys cluster in p39.

He was considered to be one of the driving forces behind groove metal. Abbott was shot and killed by a gunman while on stage during a performance with Damageplan on December 8, 2004, at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio. He ranked No. 92 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Guitarists and No. 1 in the UK magazine Metal Hammer.\\nContext: On December 8, 2004, during the Devastation Across The Nation tour, Abbott was shot on-stage while performing with Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio. A crowd of approximately 250 had watched four support acts (two local bands entitled Volume Dealer and 12 Gauge, and the tour support Shadows Fall and The Haunted). Moments into Damageplan's set, 25-year-old former Marine Nathan Gale shot Abbott five times in the head with a 9 mm Beretta 92F pistol. Some in attendance initially believed the shooting was part of the act, but as Gale continued shooting, the audience quickly came to the realization that the event was not staged. Firing a total of 15 shots, Gale killed three other people and wounded seven more.  Jeff \\"Mayhem\\" Thompson, the band's head of security, was killed tackling Gale, as was Alrosa Villa employee Erin Halk. Audience member Nathan Bray was killed while trying to perform CPR on Abbott and Thompson. It was rumored that one crowd member leapt in front of the gunman, saving the lives of several band members. Damageplan's drum technician, John \\"Kat\\" Brooks, was shot three times as he attempted to disarm Gale, but was overpowered and taken hostage in a headlock hold. Tour manager Chris Paluska was also injured.  Responding within three minutes to a dispatch call made at 10:15pm, seven police officers entered through the front entrance and moved toward the stage. Officer James Niggemeyer came in through the back door, behind the stage. Gale only saw the officers in front of the stage; he did not see Niggemeyer, who was armed with a 12 gauge Remington 870 shotgun. Niggemeyer approached Gale from the opposite side of the stage past a group of security guards, and saw Gale lift his gun to Brooks' head, and fired a single shot as Gale noticed him. Gale was struck in the face with eight of the nine buckshot pellets and was killed instantly. Gale was found to have had 35 rounds of ammunition remaining.  Two fans, including Mindy Reece, a certified nurse, administered CPR on Abbott until paramedics arrived, but were unable to revive him and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Early speculation about motive suggested that Gale, who was a Pantera fan, might have turned to violence in response to the breakup of the band, or the public dispute between Abbott and Pantera singer Phil Anselmo, but these were later ruled out by investigators. In VH1's documentary, Behind the Music, Damageplan's sound engineer Aaron Barnes stated that the whole time, after shooting Dimebag, Gale was looking for Vinnie, possibly planning to murder him too. Another conjecture was that Gale believed Abbott had stolen a song that he had written. About six months prior to the shooting, Gale got into an altercation at a Damageplan concert in Cincinnati where he damaged $5,000 worth of equipment while being removed from the stage by security.\\nQuestion: Where was he performing?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Columbus, Ohio.","rationale":"As the question is asking for the city where Dimebag Darrell was performing, and as we can see from context that Gale shot Abbott on-stage while he was performing with Damageplan at Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio.\\nTherefore, answer to this question would be: \\"Columbus (Ohio)\\"."},{"source":"Answer the question...who sings no matter how high i get??","target":"The Oak Ridge Boys","rationale":"\\"No Matter How High I Get\\" is a song by country group The Oak Ridge Boys.\\nIt was written by the lead singer of Alabama Randy Owen, and it appears on the album American Made (1983)."},{"source":"You are given a math word problem and you are supposed to apply a single mathematical operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division on the numbers embedded in the text to answer the following question and then only report final the numerical answer.\\n\\nBrandon has 96 Skittles .

His parents were Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker, and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith. Nixon was a descendant of the early American settler, Thomas Cornell, who was also an ancestor of Ezra Cornell, the founder of Cornell University, as well as of Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates.\\n\\nNixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace. Following the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union. The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party; Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Nikolai Podgorny, the head of state, among other leading Soviet officials.  Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev. Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of \\"peaceful coexistence\\". A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin.  Seeking to foster better relations with the United States, both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily. Nixon later described his strategy:  I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist, if possible, the help of the Soviets and the Chinese. Though rapprochement with China and detente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves, I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war. At worst, Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing. At best, if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry, Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept.  Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974. He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening. Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, detente, and MIRVs.

The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.","target":"Trip","rationale":"The passage mentions that the lake effect snow adds feet of snow to yearly totals, and lingers much longer on the eastern side.

This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne.

But sadly, hiring someone to take care of them when you're going to work is getting more expensive by the year.\\nEarlier this month it was reported, that the cost of involving an infant or small kid at a childcare centre rose 3 percent in 2012, faster than the general cost of living. There are now large strips of the country where daycare   for an infant costs more than 10% of the average married couples' income.\\nThis is not necessarily a new trend, but it is somewhat puzzling me. The price of professional childcare has been rising since the 1980s. Yet during that time, pay for professional childcare workers has stood still. Actually caregivers   earn less today than they did in 1990. Considering that labor costs are responsible for about 80% of a daycare center's expenses, one would infer that stable wages means stable prices.\\nSo who is to blame for higher child care costs?\\nChildcare is a carefully regulated industry. States lay down rules about how many children each employee is allowed to watch over, the space care centers need per child, and other details. And the stricter the regulations are, the higher the costs will be. In Massachusetts, where childcare centers must hire one teacher for every three infants, the price of care averaged more than $ 16,000 per year. In Mississippi, where centers must hire one teacher for every five infants, the price of care averaged less than $5,000.\\nUnfortunately I don't have all the daycare center regulations, but I wouldn't be surprised if as the rules have become more complicated, prices have risen. The tradeoff   might be worth it in certain cases; after all, the health and safety of children should probably come before cheap service. But certainly, it doesn't seem to be an accident that some of the cheapest daycare available is in the least regulated South.\\nQuestion: What problem do parents of small kids have to face?\\nOptions: A: The ever-rising child care prices.\\nB: The budgeting of family expenses.\\nC: The balance between work and family.\\nD: The selection of a good daycare center","target":"A","rationale":"The article discusses the problems facing parents of small children who require child care while their parents are working. The author focuses on how costs for childcare have risen rapidly over time, and makes a connection between these rising costs and government regulations that govern the practices at daycare centers. These regulations can make it more expensive to operate a daycare center by requiring specific employee-child ratios or additional equipment such as fire extinguishers or first aid kits in each classroom.\\nGiven this information, we know that option A is correct since cost increases due to strict regulation would cause prices to increase faster than general inflation rates--which means they'd be increasing \\"by the year\\". Option B may seem like a reasonable answer because families with two working adults need help budgeting their expenses when one parent stays home from work full"},{"source":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What bands album produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 18 November 1991 on Island Records and second single eached the top ten of the singles charts in several countries, including the band's native Ireland?","target":"U2","rationale":"The question can be rephrased as: \\"What band's album, produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno and released on November 18th 1991 on Island Records, had a second single that reached the top ten of singles charts in several countries including the bands native country?\\"\\nThis refers to U2's album Achtung Baby."},{"source":"Brazil - Pope John Paul II has a Brazilian cousin living in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the full name of the \\"abominable accompanist\\" Ferrier later found out had been ill for months?","target":"Arpád Sándor","rationale":"From the excerpt, it can be inferred that Ferrier was so upset with her accompanist due to his \\"abominable\\" playing.

British nationality law governs modern British citizenship and nationality, which can be acquired, for instance, by descent from British nationals. When used in a historical context, \\"British\\" or \\"Britons\\" can refer to the Celtic Britons, the indigenous inhabitants of Great Britain and Brittany, whose surviving members are the modern Welsh people, Cornish people and Bretons. Although early assertions of being British date from the Late Middle Ages, the creation of the united Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 triggered a sense of British national identity.\\n\\nThe indigenous people of the British Isles have a combination of Celtic, Norse, Anglo-Saxon and Norman ancestry.  Between the 8th and 11th centuries, \\"three major cultural divisions\\" had emerged in Great Britain: the English, the Scots and the Welsh, the earlier Brittonic Celtic polities in what are today England and Scotland having finally been absorbed into Anglo-Saxon England and Gaelic Scotland by the early 11th century. The English had been unified under a single nation state in 937 by King Athelstan of Wessex after the Battle of Brunanburh. Before then, the English (known then in Old English as the Anglecynn) were under the governance of independent Anglo-Saxon petty kingdoms which gradually coalesced into a Heptarchy of seven powerful states, the most powerful of which were Mercia and Wessex. Scottish historian and archaeologist Neil Oliver said that the Battle of Brunanburh would \\"define the shape of Britain into the modern era\\", it was a \\"showdown for two very different ethnic identities - a Norse Celtic alliance versus Anglo Saxon. It aimed to settle once and for all whether Britain would be controlled by a single imperial power or remain several separate independent kingdoms, a split in perceptions which is still very much with us today\\". However, historian Simon Schama suggested that it was Edward I of England who was solely \\"responsible for provoking the peoples of Britain into an awareness of their nationhood\\" in the 13th century. Scottish national identity, \\"a complex amalgam\\" of Gaelic, Brittonic, Pictish, Norsemen and Anglo-Norman origins, was not finally forged until the Wars of Scottish Independence against the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.  Though Wales was conquered by England, and its legal system replaced by that of the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542, the Welsh endured as a nation distinct from the English, and to some degree the Cornish people, although conquered into England by the 11th century, also retained a distinct Brittonic identity and language. Later, with both an English Reformation and a Scottish Reformation, Edward VI of England, under the counsel of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, advocated a union with the Kingdom of Scotland, joining England, Wales, and Scotland in a united Protestant Great Britain. The Duke of Somerset supported the unification of the English, Welsh and Scots under the \\"indifferent old name of Britons\\" on the basis that their monarchies \\"both derived from a Pre-Roman British monarchy\\".  Following the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603, the throne of England was inherited by James VI, King of Scots, so that the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under James VI of Scotland and I of England, an event referred to as the Union of the Crowns. King James advocated full political union between England and Scotland, and on 20 October 1604 proclaimed his assumption of the style \\"King of Great Britain\\", though this title was rejected by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland, and so had no basis in either English law or Scots law.\\n\\nwhat is important in this article","target":"Following the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603, the throne of England was inherited by James VI, King of Scots,","rationale":"The given article's main focus is the history of Britian which is why only historical events are provided in detail.

Washington continued an old tradition of playing its arch-rival Cowboys in the first week of the season. Both teams were unimpressive and the Redskins offense sputtered throughout the game, but they finally won 13-10 after a touchdown pass by Tony Romo was nullified after a holding call. They hosted the Texans in Week 2, but good all-around offensive performance (especially by McNabb, who passed for 426 yards and a touchdown) failed to secure a win. The game tied at 27-27 and went into overtime where Houston kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard FG, ending the match at 30-27. After this, the Redskins lost to St. Louis 30-16 before McNabbs return to Philadelphia. Although Washington did not deliver a particularly strong performance, they won 16-12 after Eagles QB Michael Vick was injured and replaced by Kevin Kolb. In Week 5, they hosted Green Bay for only the second time since 1979 (the first was in 2004) and beat them 16-13. After losing a Sunday Night match to the Colts, Washington beat Chicago in Week 7. Although McNabb threw two interceptions, the team took advantage of their opponents porous O-line to sack and pick off Jay Cutler (American football) four times, winning 17-14. After losing a 37-25 trap game in Detroit, the Redskins went on their bye week and returned to host Philadelphia on MNF for the second straight year. As rain fell on Fedex Field, the Eagles proceeded to crush Washington 59-28 with eight touchdowns. In contrast to the huge numbers put up by Michael Vick, McNabb looked decidedly unimpressive, with two touchdown passes and three interceptions (one returned for a TD). Just before the game, he had finalized his contract with the Redskins, who gave him a 5-year, $78 million deal and allowing him to (barring unforeseen circumstances) finish out his career in Washington. After beating Tennessee, the Redskins lost four straight games and were removed from playoff contention before beating Jacksonville in Week 16.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

She is stuck between two cars but needs to get to the off ramp and decides to speed up. She hits the gas making her car go faster so she can get ahead of the two cars she is stuck in between and makes it to the ramp in time.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Given Angela decided decelerate instead would her car have gone faster or slower?","target":"slower","rationale":"Deceleration is defined as the negative value of acceleration and a change in velocity. For example, if an object accelerates from 10 m/s to 20 m/s over 2 seconds (20 −10)/2 = 5m/s^2), its deceleration would be -5 meters per second squared (-(20 −10)/2). In this case, it took Angela two seconds to go from 10 miles per hour to 20 miles per hour so she had a positive acceleration rate of 5 mph (meters) /second or s.

Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3).

We first discussed a date and threw ideas around about a month ago. At that time the groom was working retail as a manager and said he has a really hard time taking weekends off. As such, we decided to plan the party for a Wednesday to accommodate his needs. Two party members were glad for this decision because they also work retail/service and also have an easier time taking off during the week compared to the weekend. Other party members and friends to be invited work regular Mon-Fri, 9-5 jobs (myself included). Some of them are even coming in from out of state. But we all agreed we could take vacation time to make it work to make sure the groom’s needs were met.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAbout a week and a half ago he informs our friend group (in general) that he’s applying for an office job. I halted planning because I knew if he got it he would probably prefer a Saturday over a Wednesday (I also knew he'd probably get it since I used to work there and a mutual friend still does and recommended him). Yesterday he found out he got the job. He’s super excited and relieved to escape retail hell, and I’m super happy for him, too! But this means he now does the M-F, 9-5 grind and that the Wednesday is no longer convenient for him at all. I asked him if he’d like us to move it to a Saturday and he said yes please.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo I contacted the group to say, “Hey, since the groom’s job situation has changed I think it’s best to move the party date to that Saturday instead.” As a note, this party was planned for 3/20 and I proposed we move it to 3/23 with approval from the groom, AKA, it’s still a month away. No reservations have been made and no money has been put down. Everything is local, relatively inexpensive, and we are not staying at a hotel or renting limos (per the groom’s tastes we’re doing stuff like an old school arcade and stuff).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe two party members working retail/service are balking. One of them says she already requested off and there’s no way she can get that Saturday off despite it being a month away, and that we already agreed to a Wednesday. I reiterated that the change is to accommodate the groom and asked if they could at least try to request off. They’re acting like I’m an asshole because I want to change the date based on the groom’s new circumstances. I even offered to try to move the date to a later weekend but they aren’t budging. They think we should go forward with the Wednesday. I don’t want my friends’ party to only have half his wedding party but I also don’t see how it’s fair to make the groom use 2 out of his 5 vacation days for his own bachelor party when he’ll need those days for more important things. Especially when he has weekends off at no cost of PTO.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, am I the asshole here?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author describes the planning of a bachelor party and how they changed the date of the party to accommodate the groom's work schedule.

Two members of the wedding party are upset about this decision because they had already requested time off for Wednesday and cannot get that Saturday off instead. The author was trying to accommodate both friends' needs, but given that there are no reservations made for either day, that both days are still a month away, and that there is ample time for everyone else in attendance (including those traveling) to request vacation time or reschedule plans if necessary (since neither day is overbooked), it seems like it would be easier in this case just to keep with their original plan and move forward with March 20th as planned.

Formed in 1984 by brothers Max and Igor Cavalera, the band was a major force in the thrash metal and groove metal genres during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their later experiments drawing influence from alternative metal, world music, nu metal, hardcore punk and industrial metal. Sepultura has had several changes in its lineup since its formation, with Max and Igor Cavalera departing in 1996 and 2006, respectively. Sepultura's current lineup consists of vocalist Derrick Green, guitarist Andreas Kisser, bassist Paulo Jr. and drummer Eloy Casagrande.\\n\\nSepultura's tenth album, Dante XXI, was released on March 14, 2006. It is a concept album based on Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy. Music videos were recorded for the songs \\"Convicted in Life\\" and \\"Ostia\\". AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that, \\"Overall, Dante XXI is easily one of Sepultura's strongest releases to feature Green on vocals.\\"  In a 2007 interview with Revolver magazine, Max Cavalera stated that he and Igor, both of whom having recently reconciled after a decade-long feud, would reunite with the original Sepultura lineup. There were also rumors that the reunited line up would play on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007. However, this was denied by Kisser and the reunion did not occur. Instead, Igor Cavalera left the band after the release of Dante XXI and was replaced by Brazilian drummer Jean Dolabella, leaving the band without any of its original members. After leaving Sepultura, Igor and Max formed Cavalera Conspiracy.  The band was one of the featured musical guests at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2008 on November 13. They performed a cover of \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\", and \\"We've Lost You\\" from the album A-Lex. The 9th annual Latin Grammy Awards ceremony was held at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas and aired on Univision. Sepultura also appeared in a successful ad campaign for Volkswagen motors commercial that aired nationally throughout Brazil in 2008. The spot said that \\"it's the first time you've seen Sepultura like this. And a Sedan like this one too\\". The Volkswagen TV spot shows Sepultura playing bossa nova, the opposite of its heavy metal style, to say that \\"you never saw something like this, as you never saw a car like the new Voyage\\".  Sepultura released the album A-Lex on 26 January 2009. This was the first Sepultura album to include neither of the Cavalera brothers, with bassist Paulo Jr. as the sole remaining member from the band's debut album. A-Lex is a concept album based on the book A Clockwork Orange. The album was recorded at Trama Studios in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with producer Stanley Soares. AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, \\"Personnel changes can have a very negative effect on a band, but Sepultura have maintained their vitality all these years - and that vitality is alive and well on the superb A-Lex.\\" In the same year Andreas Kisser contributed his recipe for \\"Churrasco in Soy Sauce\\" to Hellbent for Cooking: The Heavy Metal Cookbook, stating in the recipe that he prefers his meat \\"medium-rare\\". Sepultura supported Metallica on January 30 and January 31, 2010, at Morumbi Stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The two concerts were attended by 100,000 people. The band filmed a concert DVD in 2010. Sepultura played at Kucukciftlik Park, Istanbul, on April 27, 2010.

The ground was rich with smells. Even in the high-class housing area where we were working, the stones held traces of many sole and confusing scents (smells). As I searched for the scent that would give me a clue to the tail of the guilty man, my tail wagged slowly, thoughtfully, delightedly. Work was like play to me; I enjoyed it.\\nA small group of people gathered behind us. Among these onlookers was the old caretaker of the building next door to ours. He spoke in a scornful voice, \\"You actually think your dog might catch a thief three days after the event?\\" My master said nothing, but I'm sure he must have smiled. I did not turn to look. I knew he would not speak unless it was to give me a new command.\\nI needed to concentrate. My task was difficult.

He was running his hand over his fat stomach. His rough palm and smooth shirt combined to make a slight noise.

The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than $34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another $215 million in gold and $2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda.

The necessity and importance of an automatic Emotion recognition system is getting increased. Traditional approaches of emotion recognition are based on facial images, measurements of heart rates, blood pressure, temperatures, tones of voice/speech, etc. However, these features can potentially be changed to fake features. So to detect hidden and real features that is not controlled by the person are data measured from brain signals. There are various ways of measuring brain waves: EEG, MEG, FMRI, etc. On the bases of cost effectiveness and performance trade-offs, EEG is chosen for emotion recognition in this work. The main aim of this study is to detect emotion based on EEG signal analysis recorded from brain in response to visual stimuli. The approaches used were the selected visual stimuli were presented to 11 healthy target subjects and EEG signal were recorded in controlled situation to minimize artefacts (muscle or/and eye movements).   The signals were filtered and type of frequency band was computed and detected. The proposed method predicts an emotion type (positive/negative) in response to the presented stimuli. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach was tested. The average accuracy of machine learning algorithms (i.e. J48, Bayes Net, Adaboost and Random Forest) are 78.86, 74.76, 77.82 and 82.46 respectively.

However, recognition of eosinophiluria by Wright's staining is technically difficult, and the spectrum of disorders causing eosinophiluria is not completely defined. We have adapted Hansel's stain for the examination of urinary sediment. Whereas there was a variable uptake of Wright's stain by eosinophils in the urine, such eosinophils were readily recognized with Hansel's stain by the presence of bright red granules. The prevalence of eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis was 10 of 11 patients, in acute tubular necrosis none of 30, in acute pyelonephritis none of 10, in acute cystitis 1 of 15, in postinfectious glomerulonephritis 1 of 6, in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis 4 of 10, and in acute prostatitis 6 of 10. Eosinophiluria in acute interstitial nephritis was demonstrated by Hansel's stain in 10 of 11 patients but by Wright's stain in only 2 of 11 patients. We conclude that Hansel's stain substantially improves the recognition of eosinophiluria as compared with Wright's stain. Eosinophiluria is useful in distinguishing acute interstitial nephritis from acute tubular necrosis. The clinical spectrum of eosinophiluria also includes rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, acute prostatitis, and occasionally, acute cystitis or postinfectious glomerulonephritis. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Eosinophiluria--a new method of detection and definition of the clinical spectrum. option2: Impotence: evaluation with cavernosography.","target":"Eosinophiluria--a new method of detection and definition of the clinical spectrum","rationale":"The abstract provides information about a new method for the detection of eosinophiluria and defines the clinical spectrum of disorders that may cause this type of proteinuria.

Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a baronetcy, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as gentry, not aristocracy. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \\"Best bedchamber\\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi-basement containing service..., can you guess it ?","target":"guest and family rooms should be quite separate","rationale":"I guess that the answer is: guest and family rooms should be quite separate.

At low tide it is only about 100 metres ( 330 ft ) from mainland Skye . Harlosh Skerry lies just offshore to the north west . At low tide on the northern coast there is a large sand bay , however , watercraft should take caution when attempting to land in the bay as several rock formations pose a navigational hazard at low tide .

It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience.

I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged, but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty. A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.

Passage:The Democratic Party of Hawaii was formed on April 30, 1900 by supporters of the queen in the wake of a plague quarantine in Honolulu. The meeting brought together five men: John H. Wilson, son of Marshal of the Kingdom Charles B. Wilson; John S. McGrew, a doctor and supporter of Kalākaua; Charles J. McCarthy, a saloon owner and former Honolulu Rifle; David Kawānanakoa, prince of the House of Kawānanakoa; and Delbert Evener Metzger, an engineer from Kaua'i. The group believed that it was necessary for a party in Hawaii, now a region of the US, to have a national counterpart to survive and established the Democratic Party of Hawaii. The intention of the party was to promote Jeffersonian philosophy and home rule. Following the Overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy, the Reform Party of Hawaii seized control of government and intended to annex Hawaii to the United States. The reformers became affiliated with the Republican Party for this support of Hawaii's annexation in contrast to the Democrats' opposition. The American Union Party became the regional Republican party in Hawaii, leaving the Democratic Party for any opposition group. The first convention of the Democratic Party of Hawaii was held on May 16 that year and was attended by 500 people.

His teachers at the Conservatoire in Leipzig included the great pianist Ignaz Moscheles, who had been a pupil of Beethoven. Back in Britain, Barnett enjoyed a successful career as a pianist for some years but concentrated increasingly on composition and teaching. He became noticed as a composer with his symphony in A minor (1864), and followed this with a number of compositions for orchestra, strings and piano. His cantata The Ancient Mariner premiered at Birmingham in 1867, and another, Paradise and the Peri, in 1870, both successfully. In 1873 his most important work, the oratorio The Raising of Lazarus, was written, and in 1876 produced at Hereford.
