In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative?\\nThis is where creativity get’s tricky.\\nIt’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula.

He is widely regarded as the greatest football player of all time. In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS). That same year, Pele was elected Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee.\\n\\nPele arrived in Sweden sidelined by a knee injury but on his return from the treatment room, his colleagues stood together and insisted upon his selection. His first match was against the USSR in the third match of the first round of the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he gave the assist to Vava's second goal. He was the youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to play in the World Cup. Against France in the semifinal, Brazil was leading 2-1 at halftime, and then Pele scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.  On 29 June 1958, Pele became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5-2 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pele's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; \\"When Pele scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding\\". When the match ended, Pele passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.  It was in the 1958 World Cup that Pele began wearing a jersey with number 10. The event was the result of disorganization: the leaders of the Brazilian Federation did not send the shirt numbers of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt to Pele who was a substitute on the occasion. The press proclaimed Pele the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind Didi.\\n\\nWhere was the 1958 World Cup held?","target":"in Stockholm,","rationale":"The context describes Pele's historic performance in the 1958 World Cup.

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\".\\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall.\\nWood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom.

Pat Flynn, one of the band members of the New Grass Revival, guested on the recording of Movin' On as a session guitarist, and would return to do so again on Weather and Water. The album was said to break past traditional rules of bluegrass music by integrating a jam-band mindset while blending classical folk balladry and rock 'n' roll into the sound. Contrasting with that appraisal, the album was also cited as a traditional and successful \\"lo-fi\\" approach to bluegrass music. Critics noted the virtuoso solos on mandolin, fiddle, and guitar on Movin' On.The Greencards gained more fans and became known by name quickly after the release of Movin' On. The band was credited with performing the most energetic sets during the course of the 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival, were said to bring a global sound to bluegrass, and—by drawing on influences such as Bob Dylan and The Beatles—were pushing the genre's boundaries. Their live show during this period was ranked by the Houston Chronicle in the top five nights of live music for the year in 2004.Movin' On earned The Greencards the 2004 Austin Music Award for Best New Band.

This equates to 641.4 mm. [...] Assuming this sample is roughly representative of adult female U.S. crania, Oprah's head perimeter is 6.3 SD above the mean of American women.    [*\\"Independent confirmation of Oprah's head size\\"*] >The late Gene Siskel went hat shopping with Oprah and the salesman said Oprah's was the largest head he'd ever seen. Using the late J.P. Rushton's idea of using the formula for calculating the volume of a hemisphere (V = circumfence\\\\^3 / 118.4) Oprah would have a cranial capacity of 2229 cm\\\\^3...    [*\\"Brain size & ethnic genetic interests at 70th annual Tony Awards\\"*] >I spent Sunday evening trying to watch anything other than the news and I stumbled upon the 70th annual Tony Awards. Generally speaking, high IQ people tend to be fans of the arts, so it came as no surprise to see arguably the biggest brained and most successful woman on the planet, multi-billionaire Oprah, dominating the event.    [*\\"IQ & fighting back against racism\\"*]  >Oprah's 2029 cc cranial capacity gave her the IQ to handle racists with style. When a skinhead called her a monkey and then tried to change the subject, Oprah grabbed him by the arm and said '\\"I want to talk about the *monkey business*\\". This showed lateral thinking because they were literally talking about monkeys...    [*\\"Big brained Oprah triples the value of Weight Watchers stock; could make $100 million in 36 hours\\"*]([Link]    >With a cranial capacity of perhaps 2,029 cm\\\\^3, Oprah has just adapted her situation to her advantage, by buying a 10% share in Weight Watchers, and watching the stock roughly triple in a few days, making her potentially $100 million richer in only 36 hours.    [*\\"Big Brained Oprah tried to stop the war with Iraq\\"*] >While no human in history has had a deviation IQ much beyond 200, Oprah's 2,029 cc estimated brain size is arguably around what you would statistically expect from a 400 IQ being, and so was the wisdom she displayed in the run-up to the war in Iraq. [...] It seems marvelously symbolic that Oprah, arguably the biggest brained member of America's elite ultimately passed that test with such flying colours, and got on the right side of history.    [*\\"Getting rich off cold winter genes\\"*] >...one day Oprah's enormous brain size seemed to allow her the higher level cognitive ability that transcended cognitive abilities themselves: Meta cognition; self-awareness [...] How did Oprah display self-awareness? Martha Stewart began showing Oprah a very efficient way to maneuver a bed sheet, and asked Oprah to grap one corner of the bed sheet. Sensing she didn't have the spatial ability to perform the task competently and not wanting to look foolish in front of millions of TV viewers, Oprah was forced to adapt. Instead of grabbing the corner of the sheet, Oprah spontaneously ran to the audience to grab a Martha Stewart fan.    [*\\"Only Ashkenazi Jews were smart enough to compete with Oprah\\"*]>As a compassionate social Darwinist, I watched in great fascination as arguably the biggest brained member of both her race and her gender, emerged as the World's richest black and the World's most influential woman. [...] It seemed to me her huge brain size was giving her an ability to come up with witty comments, and down-home folksy wisdom that kept the audience entertained. [...] With a cranial capacity almost as stratospheric as Oprah's, Rosie [O'Donnell] had the smarts to become the only gentile in syndicated talk show history to almost beat Oprah in the ratings    [*\\"Has any self-made woman or black in history EVER been the most powerful person on Earth?\\"*] >The only self-made woman and the only black who has come close to being the most powerful person on Earth has been Oprah, who for years reigned as the billionaire Queen of all Media and kingmaker to Obama's presidency, but she was born with a freakishly large brain size which helped make her especially smart. [...] Had her IQ been even higher still (150 instead of 140), she might have made the leap from Presidential king maker to President.    [*\\"How Oprah cured my homophobia\\"*]    >...to hear the World's most influential woman give [a political opinion] that was so succinct, loud, powerful and graphic, and on behalf of an oppressed minority other than her own, just brought the house down. In that moment, my homophobia was cured. [...] Rather than trying to defend an awkward argument, Oprah had the cognitive adaptability to shift gears completely, by saying \\"I wasn't trying to absurd, sir\\" [...] Big brained Oprah then cleverly used her power which he did not have, by cutting to commercial break.    [*\\"Big brained black billionaire\\"*]= >A thousand years from now, when no one even knows who Oprah was, anthropologists might dig through the soil and discover a skeleton with a colossal cranial capacity and assume it belonged to someone extremely intelligent.  They'll think it must have belong to some rare super human, perhaps a more evolved species.  They might then discover the remains of her massive brick mansion and realize her intelligence allowed her to rule over the other humans of her time.    [*\\"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...beautiful brain\\"*] >But the ultimate brain scan art would be if Oprah posed intimately with other luminaries, since Oprah's arguably both the biggest brained member of both her race and her gender and the most successful member of both her race and her gender. The MRI scan could be displayed in the Oprah Winfrey wing of the **Smithsonian's** new National Museum of African American History and Culture.","target":"no","rationale":"The given post does not contain anything rude or disrespectful about someone's identity, appearance, race, gender, or sexual orientation.

This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.\\n\\nand the situation: Two friends were in college.

The term usually refers to relatively simple programs, that can be combined together to accomplish a task, much as one might use multiple hand tools to fix a physical object. The ability to use a variety of tools productively is one hallmark of a skilled software engineer.\\n\\n- A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.\\n\\n- In computer science, a compiler-compiler or compiler generator is a programming tool that creates a parser, interpreter, or compiler from some form of formal description of a language and machine. The earliest and still most common form of compiler-compiler is a parser generator, whose input is a grammar (usually in BNF) of a programming language, and whose generated output is the source code of a parser often used as a component of a compiler.\\n\\n- In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed.\\n\\n- A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.\\n\\n- A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.\\n\\n- Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale.

Symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing. Some people may have chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before this occurs. If not treated within minutes, death usually occurs.\\nThe most common cause of cardiac arrest is coronary artery disease. Less common causes include major blood loss, lack of oxygen, very low potassium, heart failure, and intense physical exercise. A number of inherited disorders may also increase the risk including long QT syndrome. The initial heart rhythm is most often ventricular fibrillation. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding no pulse. While a cardiac arrest may be caused by heart attack or heart failure these are not the same.\\nPrevention includes not smoking, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. Treatment for cardiac arrest is immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and, if a shockable rhythm is present, defibrillation. Among those who survive targeted temperature management may improve outcomes. An implantable cardiac defibrillator may be placed to reduce the chance of death from recurrence.\\nIn the United States, cardiac arrest outside of hospital occurs in about 13 per 10,000 people per year (326,000 cases). In hospital cardiac arrest occurs in an additional 209,000 Cardiac arrest becomes more common with age. It affects males more often than females. The percentage of people who survive with treatment is about 8%. Many who survive have significant disability. Many U.S. television shows, however, have portrayed unrealistically high survival rates of 67%.\\n\\n- Heart failure (HF), often referred to as congestive heart failure (CHF), occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. Signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise, while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.\\nCommon causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the functioning of the heart. There are two main types of heart failure: \\"heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction\\" and \\"heart failure with normal ejection fraction\\" depending on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract is affected, or the heart's ability to relax. The severity of disease is usually graded by the degree of problems with exercise. Heart failure is not the same as myocardial infarction (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease.\\nThe condition is diagnosed based on the history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause. Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease. In people with chronic stable mild heart failure, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking, physical exercise, and dietary changes, as well as medications. In those with heart failure due to left ventricular...\\n\\n- Resuscitation is the process of correcting physiological disorders in an acutely unwell patient. It is an important part of intensive care medicine, trauma surgery and emergency medicine. Well known examples are cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\\n\\n- Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib or VF) is when the heart quivers instead of pumping due to disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles. It results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse. This is followed by irreversible death in the absence of treatment. Ventricular fibrillation is found initially in about 10% of people in cardiac arrest.\\nVentricular fibrillation can occur due to coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing irregular unformed QRS complexes without any clear P waves. An important differential diagnosis is torsades de pointes.\\nTreatment is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic. The medication epinephrine or amiodarone may be given if initial treatments are not effective. Rates of survival are about 46%. \\n\\n- Commotio cordis ( Latin , \`\` agitation of the heart '' ) is an often lethal disruption of heart rhythm that occurs as a result of a blow to the area directly over the heart ( the precordial region ) , at a critical time during the cycle of a heart beat causing cardiac arrest . It is a form of ventricular fibrillation ( V - Fib ) , not mechanical damage to the heart muscle or surrounding organs , and not the result of heart disease . The fatality rate is about 65 % . It can sometimes , but not always , be reversed by defibrillation . Commotio cordis occurs mostly in boys and young men ( average age 15 ) , usually during sports , most often baseball , often despite a chest protector . It is most often caused by a projectile , but can also be caused by the blow of an elbow or other body part . Being less developed , the thorax of an adolescent is likely more prone to this injury given the circumstances . The phenomenon was confirmed experimentally in the 1930s , with research in anaesthetized rabbits , cats and dogs .\\n\\n- A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.\\n\\n- Heart Rhythm is a peer-reviewed medical journal that covers the study and management of cardiac arrhythmia. It is the official journal of the Heart Rhythm Society and the Cardiac Electrophysiology Society. Its major focus is research and therapy of heart rhythm disorders, including mechanisms and electrophysiology, clinical and experimental, genetics, ablation, devices, drugs, and surgery. Other sections include contemporary and historical reviews, unique case reports, viewpoints, cell to bedside, hands on, featured arrhythmias, images with videos viewable on the internet, pacing/icd problems, creative concepts, humanism in medicine, EP news, editorial commentaries, basic/clinical implications, historical vignettes, current controversies, and ten questions for allied professionals.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'medical specialty' with 'emergency medicine'.","target":"commotio cordis","rationale":"The paragraph above describes a medical condition called commotio cordis.

Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen.\\nIn 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller.

On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was an American electronics company founded in Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975. Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce miniaturized telemetry modules for model rockets such as a roll rate sensor. In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic calculator market and the MITS 816 desktop calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of \\"Popular Electronics\\".

It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision. The initial British term concerning a type of government-issued document has proliferatedtaking a somewhat new meaning in business.

White papers may be considered grey literature.\\n\\n- Online help is topic-oriented, procedural or reference information delivered through computer software. It is a form of user assistance. Most online help is designed to give assistance in the use of a software application or operating system, but can also be used to present information on a broad range of subjects.

This documentation includes online help, manuals (system, end-user, training), white papers, design specifications, project plans, test plans, business correspondence, etc. With the rise of e-learning, technical writers are also charged with creating online training for their audience of learners. Technical writers explain technologies, processes, and products in many formats, including print, online, and other electronic means.\\n\\n- Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture.

He felt frustrated that he could not contribute to the war effort. His wife became a volunteer ambulance driver; Vaughan Williams went on active service to France as did Holst's brother Emil; Holst's friends the composers George Butterworth and Cecil Coles were killed in battle. He continued to teach and compose; he worked on The Planets and prepared his chamber opera Savitri for performance. It was first given in December 1916 by students of the London School of Opera at the Wellington Hall in St John's Wood. It attracted no attention at the time from the main newspapers, though when professionally staged five years later it was greeted as \\"a perfect little masterpiece.\\" In 1917 he wrote The Hymn of Jesus for chorus and orchestra, a work which remained unperformed until after the war.In 1918, as the war neared its end, Holst finally had the prospect of a job that offered him the chance to serve. The music section of the YMCA's education department needed volunteers to work with British troops stationed in Europe awaiting demobilisation. Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School offered him a year's leave of absence, but there remained one obstacle: the YMCA felt that his surname looked too German to be acceptable in such a role. He formally changed \\"von Holst\\" to \\"Holst\\" by deed poll in September 1918. He was appointed as the YMCA's musical organiser for the Near East, based in Salonica.","target":"Holst","rationale":"The article mentions that Holst, along with other composers such as Vaughan Williams and George Butterworth (both of whom are mentioned in the question), were affected by World War I. While other composers enlisted or volunteered to help on the front lines, he was not able to enlist due to his health condition; however because his friends fought in war but could no longer compose during this period he continued composing throughout the war despite feeling frustrated about being unable to contribute directly. \\nTherefore it can be inferred from the context that \\"Holst\\" is who continued composing music while others did not have a chance since they had already enlisted or volunteered for military service."},{"source":"The Mongols' greatest triumph was when Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty in China in 1271.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.","target":"Ben","rationale":"The paragraph implies that Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting, which suggests that Ben may not have been as focused on the topic.

Then multiplying this by two gives us 1 side with an area A = 0x6 * 2 which equals 1m2 .\\n\\nSince there are 4 sides on a rectangle , multiply this total by 4 to get 4 * A = 4 * 1 which equals 4 m2 . That's how much gravel is needed for each side!

The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708–1711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714–1719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company’s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India.

In this study, infection kinetics (titres and antigen expression) of FIPV 79-1146, and FECV 79-1683, were determined in peripheral blood monocytes from 3 donor cats and compared to those in Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells. The infection kinetics in monocytes were host dependent. Monocytes from 1 cat were resistant to both FIPV-and FECV-infection. Monocytes from the other 2 cats could initially be infected by both FIPV and FECV but FIPV infection was sustained in monocytes of only one cat. FECV-infection was never sustained and viral production was up to 100 times lower than in FIPVinfected monocytes. In CrFK cells, FIPV and FECV infection kinetics did not differ. In monocytes of a larger cat population (n = 19) the 3 infection patterns were also found. Considering all 22 investigated cats, 3/22 were not susceptible for FIPV and FECV.

An inappropriate selection can lead to the loss of information of the input during forward propagation and the exponential vanishing/exploding of gradients during back-propagation. Understanding the theoretical properties of untrained random networks is key to identifying which deep networks may be trained successfully as recently demonstrated by Schoenholz et al. (2017) who showed that for deep feedforward neural networks only a specific choice of hyperparameters known as the \`edge of chaos' can lead to good performance.\\n We complete this analysis by providing quantitative results showing that, for a class of ReLU-like activation functions, the information propagates indeed deeper for an initialization at the edge of chaos. By further extending this analysis, we identify a class of activation functions that improve the information propagation over ReLU-like functions. This class includes the Swish activation, $\\\\phi_{swish}(x) = x \\\\cdot \\\\text{sigmoid}(x)$, used in Hendrycks & Gimpel (2016),\\n Elfwing et al. (2017) and Ramachandran et al. (2017).

The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay.

In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996.

We would go to clubs, bars and the beach, always by her proposal. It wasn't really my thing, I rarely had fun at those outings and I would much prefer staying home alone in my computer. I knew she couldn't stand to stay home alone because she'd get anxiety attacks so I usually accepted it just to keep her company.\\n\\nBut I was getting more and more annoyed by wasting my time and money in places I did not enjoyed. Going out with her was tiring. And even when we'd stay in, she always wanted to do something I was not in the mood for and I counted the seconds until she left.\\n\\nSo I decided to turn down every proposal to hang out with her, hoping she would eventually stop trying. That went on for months and during that time, I found out she was doing much worse with her anxiety and now depression. It was paralyzing her life and I tried to offer some comfort through texts. I knew her she wasn't well, but I can't say I actually felt bad for her, my only concern was not being too much of an asshole by saying \\"I don't want to be your friend anymore\\", specially now that she was struggling with her mental health. I dreaded that conversation and the awkwardness of running into her after that.\\n\\nI kept texting her because I didn't mind it. But now her invitations were loaded with guilt-tripping about her wanting to hurt herself if she stayed home so she really needed me to go out with her. That's when I got repulsed and wanted to cut thing off as soon as possible.\\n\\nI struggled with finding words not to hurt her. So a basically said I did not feel comfortable hanging out with her anymore because we had grown apart and that if she ever wanted to vent or wanted advise, she could still talk to me. As I expected, she was really hurt to hear this and, to my surprise, she said she considered me her best friend, she was also a little offended by the offer to talk to her when she was bad as it would feel like I was doing it out of pity.\\n\\nShe vented about it to all of our mutual friends and some of them gave me the benefit of the doubt but when they asked me to explain, they were even more astonished by my coldness.

The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\".\\n\\nJourney's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit \\"Wheel in the Sky\\"; however, management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving within the year.  In late 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, also hired Roy Thomas Baker as a producer to add a layered sound approach as Baker had done with his previous band, Queen. With their new lead singer and talented new producer, Journey released their fourth album, Infinity (1978). This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album. This album, with their hit song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" (#57 U.S.), set Journey on a new path with a more mainstream sound to make their highest chart success to date.  In late 1978, manager Herbie Herbert fired drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who joined Bay Area rivals Jefferson Starship shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory recorded Evolution (1979), which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16); and Departure (1980), which reached No. 8 on the album charts.  Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured.  Keyboardist Gregg Rolie then left the band, the second time in his career he left a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love),\\" but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How did that album do?","target":"This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album.","rationale":"From the context, we can see that Rolie (keyboardist) left and was later replaced by Jonathan Cain.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

The mean of this list is given by \\\\(\\\\frac{a + b + c + d}{4}\\\\), which must be equal to both the median and mode. Since all four numbers are even, their sum is a multiple of 4; since they are positive, they cannot all be 0. Therefore, we can write \\\\(a+b+c+d = 4x\\\\) for some integer x. This also means that each number in the list must be a multiple of 4 as well (since otherwise we could not divide their sum by 4 to get an integer). Now consider adding one number e to this list: \\\\[(a+b+c+d)+e=4x+e\\\\]. If we want this expression to still divide into an integer evenly and still have each number in it being a multiple of 4 after e has been added, then e must also be divisible by 4 (since if it isn't then \\\\(4x\\\\) won't divide evenly into \\\\(4x + e\\\\)). For example, if x = 5 then we have 20 as our sum before adding any new numbers; if we add another even number n such that n is not divisible by 4 (e.g., 2), then 20 would no longer evenly divide into 22. However, adding 2n would give us 24 instead - which would still work since 24/2 = 12 and 12/2 = 6 - so option (A) works in general because whenever you add or subtract any number from your equation you only need to multiply or divide both sides of your equation by that same number respectively so long as you don't change its sign: \\\\[(a+b)\\\\pm c=X\\\\Rightarrow(a\\\\pm c)+(b\\\\pm c)=X\\\\\\\\Rightarrow((a-c)+(b-c))+(2c)=X\\\\\\\\Rightarrow(((1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(2))=(5)(5)). \\\\] Likewise for option D where again multiplication does not affect equality between equations: \\\\[(abcd)=(degh)\\\\Rightarrow(\\\\alpha abcd)=(abcdegh)=(efghijklmnopqrs)\\\\] where \\\\(\\\\alpha , j , m , p , s\\\\) are arbitrary constants with respect to x .\\n\\nThe problem with option E is that when removing two numbers from the original set it will break its symmetry about the median thus making impossible for them all three measures stay equal at once while options C & B do not affect symmetry at all because they do so in a way either preserving its previous state or symmetrically affecting mean median & mode simultaneously through addition duplication/triplication etc therefore leaving no room for imbalances whatsoever between them.\\"\\""},{"source":"In 1972, Walter Fiers and his team at the University of Ghent were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein.

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes. Pushkin had accused D'Anthes, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet's wife, Natalya Pushkina. \\n\\nQuestion: Did Abram Gannibal have a famous great grandson?\\nI found this answer \\"No\\".

The discovery was patented and licensed to Bayer pharmaceuticals, which marketed the compound under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at Bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organizations list of essential medications. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers.

There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. \\n\\n- The inner city is the central area of a major city or metropolis. Inner city areas tend to have higher population densities than outer suburbs, with more of the population living inside multi-floored townhouses and apartment buildings.\\n\\n- The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.\\n\\n- A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).\\n\\n- Philippe de Vitry (31 October 1291  9 June 1361) was a French composer, music theorist and poet. He was an accomplished, innovative, and influential composer, and may also have been the author of the \\"Ars Nova\\" treatise. He was widely acknowledged as the greatest musician of his day, with Petrarch writing a glowing tribute, calling him: \\"... the keenest and most ardent seeker of truth, so great a philosopher of our age.\\"\\n\\n- Guillaume de Machaut (sometimes spelled Machault; c. 1300  April 1377) was a medieval French poet and composer. He is one of the earliest composers on whom significant biographical information is available. According to Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, Machaut was \\"the last great poet who was also a composer\\". Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer.\\n\\n- A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.\\n\\n- Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- Francesco degli Organi, Francesco il Cieco, or Francesco da Firenze, called by later generations Francesco Landini or Landino (c. 1325 or 1335  September 2, 1397) was an Italian composer, organist, singer, poet and instrument maker. He was one of the most famous and revered composers of the second half of the 14th century, and by far the most famous composer in Italy.\\n\\n- Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- Ars nova (Latin for new art) refers to a musical style which flourished in France and the Burgundian Low Countries in the Late Middle Ages: more particularly, in the period between the preparation of the \\"Roman de Fauvel\\" (1310s) and the death of the composer Guillaume de Machaut in 1377. The term is sometimes used more generally to refer to all European polyphonic music of the 14th century. For instance, \\"Italian ars nova\\" is sometimes used to denote the music of Francesco Landini and his compatriots (although Trecento music is the more common term for music in Italy). The \\"ars\\" in \\"ars nova\\" can be read as \\"technique\\", or \\"style\\". The term was first used in two musical treatises, titled \\"Ars novae musicae\\" (New Technique of Music) (c. 1320) by Johannes de Muris, and a collection of writings (c. 1322) attributed to Philippe de Vitry often simply called \\"Ars nova\\" today. However, the term was only first used to describe an historical era by Johannes Wolf in 1904.\\n\\n- The Roman de Fauvel is a 14th-century French allegorical verse romance of satirical bent, generally attributed to Gervais du Bus, a clerk at the French royal chancery. The original narrative of 3,280 octosyllabics is divided into two books, dated to 1310 and 1314 respectively. In 13167 Chaillou de Pesstain produced a greatly expanded version.\\n\\n- Johannes de Muris ( c.1290 - c.1355 ) was a French philosopher , astronomer , mathematician , and music theorist best known for treatises on the ars nova , titled Ars nove musice . Life For a medieval person primarily known through his scholarly writing , it is highly unusual that Johannes de Muris '' life can be traced enough to form a decently consistent biography . Born in Normandy , he is believed to have been related to Julian des Murs who was secretary to Charles V of France . The suggested birth year for Muris is based on a murder of a cleric on September 7 , 1310 , which Muris was allegedly a part of . Muris would have been at least 14 to assume the responsibility for the crime , suggesting his birth year to be sometime in the 1290s . He was convicted and banished to Cyprus for seven years for punishment . The aloof and haphazard movements of his life have been blamed on this early punishment . By 1318 records indicate that Muris was living in Evreux although he was actively taking part in scholastic endeavors in Paris . An explicit of his writings indicate that he was a resident in the Collège de Sorbonne until around 1325 . During this time it is believed that he travelled freely , making trips to the town of Bernay to observe the solar eclipse of 1321 . However , the double monastery of Fontevrault ( Maine0et - Loire ) was where he settled in March 1326 . He remained associated with the institution until 1332 or 1333 when he returned to Evreux . Financial records in Muris '' own hand from 1336 indicate that he took up residence in Paris in that year . In 1342 he was one of six cannons of the collegiate church in Mézières - en - Brenne . In 1344 , he was invited to Avignon by Pope Clement VI to participate in the calendar reform . The final date associated to Muris is 1345 in conjunction with the reforms that took place in Avignon .

You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story. And a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. To sum up, you should write the second sentence of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the new ending(last three sentences) of the story.\\n\\nPremise: Samantha was starting her new school this morning. \\n Initial Context: This is her third school in as many years. \\n Original Ending: She's gotten used to making new friends and then losing them.

The original ending implies that Samantha does not enjoy moving schools and wishes this could be her last school. However, the new ending implies that Samantha enjoys moving schools and wonders if this could be her last one. The counterfactual context needs to explain why she might now enjoy moving schools when she previously did not. Since the rest of the context doesn't change, it is likely that what has changed is how she feels about constantly changing schools. Therefore, the counterfactual context should be something along the lines of \\"She enjoyed moving schools constantly\\"."},{"source":"A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. \\nBased on the previous passage, In which non-Albanian language-family has a raised to o? \\nIs \\"Illyrian\\" a correct answer?","target":"No","rationale":"The context mentions that the Albanian language has a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a.

The head coach was Frank Martin, who served his 3rd year at the helm of the Wildcats. The team played its home games in Bramlage Coliseum in Manhattan, Kansas. Kansas State is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The Wildcats began conference play with a trip to Columbia, Missouri and faced the Missouri Tigers and finished the year with a home game against the Iowa State Cyclones. They finished the season 29–8 and ranked #7 in the AP Poll and the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll. They lost to the rival Kansas Jayhawks in the finals of the Big 12 Tournament, 72–64.\\n Passage 2:On June 14, reigning GHC Heavyweight Champion Jun Akiyama was forced to vacate the title due to herniated discs in his back. As a result, Shiozaki was nominated by Akiyama to wrestle for the title against the number one contender Takeshi Rikio. After a hard-fought twenty-minute match, Shiozaki managed to defeat Rikio to become the new GHC Heavyweight Champion. He then went on to successfully defend his title for the first time on September 27 against Akitoshi Saito. However his second title defense was unsuccessful as on December 6, Shiozaki lost the World Heavyweight title to Takashi Sugiura on the last date of the 2009 Winter Navigation tour. On May 23, 2010 Shiozaki teamed up with Atsushi Aoki to defeat Takeshi Morishima and Taiji Ishimori to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship during Pro Wrestling Noah's Navigation with Breeze show in Niigata, Niigata, Japan. As a result of the victory, Shiozaki and Aoki were scheduled to defend the title during AAA's Triplemania XVIII show. At TripleMania, Shiozaki and Aoki were the first team eliminated when Joe Lider pinned Shiozaki. The match and the title were ultimately won by Los Maniacos (Silver Cain and Último Gladiador). In August 2010 Shiozaki took part in New Japan Pro Wrestling's 2010 G1 Climax tournament, where he won four out of his seven-round robin stage matches, only to narrowly miss the finals of the tournament after wrestling Shinsuke Nakamura to a 30-minute time limit draw on the final day of the tournament. The draw with Nakamura led to a No Time Limit match at a Pro Wrestling Noah show on August 22, where Shiozaki was victorious. Shiozaki and Nakamura had their third match on January 4, 2011, at New Japan's Wrestle Kingdom V in Tokyo Dome, where Nakamura was victorious. Shiozaki regained the GHC Heavyweight Title by defeating Takashi Sugiura on July 10, 2011. On January 4, 2012, Shiozaki returned to New Japan at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where he and Naomichi Marufuji defeated CHAOS Top Team (Shinsuke Nakamura and Toru Yano) in a tag team match. On January 22, Shiozaki lost the GHC Heavyweight Championship to Takeshi Morishima. On October 26, Shiozaki and Akitoshi Saito defeated Kenta and Maybach Taniguchi to win the GHC Tag Team Championship. On December 3, 2012, it was reported that Shiozaki had threatened to not re-sign with Noah after his contract expires in January 2013, when the promotion decided to release Kenta Kobashi from his contract. Six days later, Shiozaki and Saito lost the GHC Tag Team Championship to Naomichi Marufuji and Takashi Sugiura. On December 19, Noah confirmed that Shiozaki would be leaving the promotion following December 24. On December 24, Shiozaki defeated Taiji Ishimori in his final Noah match.\\n Passage 3:From 1544, the text of a Weistum (a Weistum – cognate with English wisdom – was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) from Hohenöllen has been preserved. Hardship and woe were brought to the village by the Thirty Years' War and the Plague. Further suffering came in the late 17th century with French King Louis XIV's wars of conquest. In 1672, eleven families were once again living in the village, making Hohenöllen one of the biggest villages in the greater area. Hohenöllen belonged to the County Palatine of Zweibrücken until it became part of Electoral Palatinate in 1768. The instrument whereby this happened was the Selz-Hagenbach Treaty, also known as the Schwetzingen Compromise, under whose terms Zweibrücken exchanged a series of villages for another series of hitherto Electoral Palatinate villages, the former series comprising mainly the Zweibrücken villages in the Schultheißerei of Einöllen with Hohenöllen, the then town of Odernheim, Frankweiler, Niederhausen, Hochstätten and Melsheim (now in France), and the latter series comprising the Electoral Palatinate Ämter of Selz and Hagenbach (whose like-named seats today lie in France and Germany respectively). The seat of the Unteramt was now Wolfstein, which belonged to the Electoral Palatinate Oberamt of Kaiserslautern. Nevertheless, this arrangement lasted only a bit less than three decades before the whole feudal system was swept away. Goswin Widder, who about 1788 published a four-volume work about all Electoral Palatinate places, put together the following description: “Hohenöllen lies one and a half hours down from Wolfstein on the Lauter’s right bank. … A quarter hour to the side lies a considerable farm, called Sulzhof. Including this, the population of 41 families, which comprise 224 souls, is great. Besides a school, there are 33 townsmen’s houses and common houses. The municipal area contains 978 Morgen of cropfields, 100 Morgen of vineyards, 6 Morgen of gardens, 80 Morgen of meadows, 308 Morgen of forest.

Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin.

His father, John (1946-2018), was a hod carrier, and his mother, Carol, worked in a factory. He was named Paul John Gascoigne in tribute to Paul McCartney and John Lennon of the Beatles. He attended Breckenbeds Junior High School, then the Heathfield Senior High School, both in the Low Fell area of Gateshead.\\nContext: In his first season at White Hart Lane Gascoigne helped Terry Venables's Spurs to sixth in the First Division, scoring seven goals in 37 appearances. They rose to third place in 1989-90, but were still 16 points behind champions Liverpool. He was named as BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1990, and on accepting the award said that \\"I haven't won anything in the game as yet. But the World Cup did help to put England on the map\\". He was also named as Tottenham Hotspur's Player of the Year.  Gascoigne was named on the PFA Team of the Year in the 1990-91 season as Tottenham reached the FA Cup Final, with victories over Blackpool, Oxford United, Portsmouth, Notts County and North London derby rivals Arsenal. He scored the opening goal of the 3-1 victory over Arsenal at Wembley with a free-kick, one of six goals he scored in the competition. Going into the final against Nottingham Forest he had already agreed terms to join Italian club Lazio in an PS8.5 million deal. However just 15 minutes into the game he committed a dangerous knee-high foul on Gary Charles and ruptured his own cruciate ligaments in his right knee. England teammate Stuart Pearce scored from the resultant free kick, and Gascoigne subsequently collapsed after the kick-off, forcing him to leave the match on a stretcher. Tottenham went on to win the Cup in extra-time.  He missed the entire 1991-92 season while he recovered, suffering a further knee injury in late 1991, when an incident at a nightclub on Tyneside kept him out for even longer. The saga over Gascoigne's proposed transfer to Lazio dominated the tabloid press throughout 1991, often overshadowing the key national news of that time - namely the recession and rise in unemployment that it sparked - although the broadsheet newspapers generally kept stories about Gascoigne confined to their back pages.  \\"I'm very pleased for Paul but it's like watching your mother-in-law drive off a cliff in your new car.\\"\\nQuestion: What is Tottenham Hotspur?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"He was also named as Tottenham Hotspur's Player of the Year.","rationale":"The context is about Gascoigne's career as a professional soccer player.

It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote.\\nEven though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections.\\nLamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat.\\n“We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere.

Passage:For superstitious reasons, when the Romans began to intercalate to bring their calendar into line with the solar year, they chose not to place their extra month of Mercedonius after February but within it. February 24—known in the Roman calendar as \\"the sixth day before the Kalends of March\\"—was replaced by the first day of this month since it followed Terminalia, the festival of the Roman god of boundaries. After the end of Mercedonius, the rest of the days of February were observed and the new year began with the first day of March. The overlaid religious festivals of February were so complicated that Julius Caesar opted not to change it at all during his 46 calendar reform. The extra day of his system's leap years were located in the same place as the old intercalary month but he opted to ignore it as a date. Instead, the sixth day before the Kalends of March was simply said to last for 48 hours and all the other days continued to bear their original names. (The Roman practice of inclusive counting initially caused the priests in charge of the calendar to add the extra hours every three years instead of every four and Augustus was obliged to omit them for a span of decades until the system was back to where it should have been.) When the extra hours finally began to be reckoned as two separate days instead of a doubled sixth (\\"bissextile\\") one, the leap day was still taken to be the one following hard on the February 23 Terminalia. Although February 29 has been popularly understood as the leap day of leap years since the beginning of sequential reckoning of the days of months in the late Middle Ages, in Britain and most other countries, no formal replacement of February 24 as the leap day of the Julian and Gregorian calendars has occurred. The exceptions include Sweden and Finland, who enacted legislation to move the day to February 29.

Major congenital anomalies of the patients were very different. Patient 1 suffered from severe congenital heart disease, but did not show apparent HSCR. Patient 2 suffered from typical HSCR and underwent surgical treatment, but did not have congenital heart disease. According to the gene analysis using white blood cells, they had nonsense mutations in ZFHX1B, R695X and Q433X, respectively.

His main area of study has been the formation and detection of extrasolar planets , but he has also worked on communications theory . In particular he has written on how patterns in animal communication relate to humans with an emphasis on cetaceans . He grew up on a dairy farm in Cambria , California and therefore did n't have much access to information about stars . But by reading books at the local library , Doyle was able to develop his knowledge in astronomy , and eventually obtain his Bachelor 's and Master 's of Science degrees in astronomy from San Diego State University . His first job was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as an imaging engineer , where he was in charge of analysing pictures of Jupiter and Saturn sent from the spacecraft Voyager . He moved to Heidelberg , Germany , to help analyse images of Halley 's Comet . He got his doctorate in Astrophysics at the University of Heidelberg .

Doyle is currently seeking to compare dolphin whistles and baby babble in an attempt to make predictions about extraterrestrial communications . He believes that by measuring the complexity of communications for different species on earth , we could get a good indication of how advanced an extraterrestrial signal is .

Italy 's entry into the war widened its scope considerably in Africa and the Mediterranean Sea . The goal of the Italian leader , Benito Mussolini , was the elimination of Anglo - French domination in the Mediterranean , the reclamation of historically Italian territory ( so - called Italia irredenta ) and the expansion of Italian influence over the Balkans and in Africa . France and Britain endeavoured throughout the 1930s to draw Mussolini away from an alliance with Germany , but Germany 's rapid successes in the early phase of the war made Italian intervention on the German side inevitable by May 1940 . Italy declared war on France and Britain on the evening of 10 June , to take effect just after midnight . The two sides exchanged air raids on the first day of war , but little transpired on the Alpine front , since both France and Italy had adopted a defensive posture along their frontier .

The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.\\nWhile the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.","target":"Japanese encephelitis","rationale":"The context discusses the discovery of vaccines and their uses.

Each segment has the same sets of organs and, in most polychaetes, has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion. Septa separate the segments of many species, but are poorly defined or absent in others, and Echiura and Sipuncula show no obvious signs of segmentation. In species with well-developed septa, the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels, and the vessels in segments near the front ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as hearts. The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments, which facilitates movement by peristalsis (\\"ripples\\" that pass along the body) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia. In species with incomplete septa or none, the blood circulates through the main body cavity without any kind of pump, and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques – some burrowing species turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves through the sediment.\\nWhat movement method do some burrowing annelids use?","target":"turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves","rationale":"The context mentions that annelids can have different movement methods and the paragraph states: \\"In species with incomplete septa or none, the blood circulates through the main body cavity without any kind of pump, and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques – some burrowing species turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves through the sediment.\\"\\nThis clearly indicates what specific type of movements are used by these annelid worms."},{"source":"Q: When a star's core collapses inward while the outer layers spread and cool, what \\"colorful\\" celestial body forms?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"red giant","rationale":"A star forms when a cloud of gas collapses under the force of gravity.

However, CNNs still suffer from a tendency to confidently classify out-distribution samples from unknown classes into pre-defined known classes. Further, they are also vulnerable to adversarial examples. We are relating these two issues through the tendency of CNNs to over-generalize for areas of the input space not covered well by the training set. We show that a CNN augmented with an extra output class can act as a simple yet effective end-to-end model for controlling over-generalization. As an appropriate training set for the extra class, we introduce two resources that are computationally efficient to obtain: a representative natural out-distribution set and interpolated in-distribution samples. To help select a representative natural out-distribution set among available ones, we propose a simple measurement to assess an out-distribution set's fitness. We also demonstrate that training such an augmented CNN with representative out-distribution natural datasets and some interpolated samples allows it to better handle a wide range of unseen out-distribution samples and black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries. Finally, we show that generation of white-box adversarial attacks using our proposed augmented CNN can become harder, as the attack algorithms have to get around the rejection regions when generating actual adversaries.","target":"Properly training CNNs with dustbin class increase their robustness to adversarial attacks and their capacity to deal with out-distribution samples","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nProperly training CNNs with dustbin class increase their robustness to adversarial attacks and their capacity to deal with out-distribution samples."},{"source":"If the gas is heated, the particles will move faster as they gain more energy.\\n\\nTina heats some oxygen gas.

Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation.

Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings, and to surface science. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles. Deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying, adhesive preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and process purging.

Humble grew up in Texas and was a multi-sport athlete at Brackenridge High School in San Antonio. He enrolled at Rice University in Houston, Texas in 1940 and played three seasons on the school's football team. Humble then spent three years in the U.S. Marines during World War II, serving in the Pacific War and earning a Bronze Star Medal before returning to complete his college studies in 1946.\\n\\nPaul Brown, the coach of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), met Humble while vacationing in Florida in 1946. Brown came to watch the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, and was staying in the same hotel as the Rice team. He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in training at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. \\"He appeared to be the sort of fellow we like to have on our team,\\" Brown said later in 1947. \\"Then I watched him in that Tennessee game and after that made up my mind he'd be with my club if I ever had the chance to make a deal for him.\\" The AAFC's Baltimore Colts selected Humble in the league's draft, but Brown got his chance in August. He engineered a trade that sent four players including quarterback Steve Nemeth and guard George Cheroke to the Colts, plus two players to be named later.  Before joining the Browns, Humble played in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual matchup between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country. The college all-stars won the game, defeating the Chicago Bears 16-0. In Cleveland, Humble was part of an offensive line that included Lin Houston, Ed Ulinski and Bob Gaudio. Their job was to protect quarterback Otto Graham from opposing defenders and open up running room for fullback Marion Motley. They chanted \\"nobody touches Graham\\" when they broke the huddle.  Helped by strong line play, Graham, Motley and Cleveland ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie led a potent offense that dominated the AAFC for three years. The Browns won the AAFC championship in 1947, 1948 and 1949 before the league disbanded and Cleveland was absorbed by the more established NFL. Humble was a consensus second-team All-Pro selection in 1948, when Cleveland won all of its games. Cleveland's success continued in the NFL in 1950, when Humble was used on occasion as a linebacker on defense. The Browns finished the season with a 10-2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams in the NFL championship game. Humble was selected to play in the first-ever Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game.  Humble continued as a member of the Marine Reserves as his professional career continued, and in 1951 he was in danger of being called up for service in the Korean War. He re-enlisted in the summer and played for a military team at Marine Corps Base Quantico later in the year. After the season, he was named the best service player in the country by the Washington Touchdown Club.  Humble was expected to return to the Browns after his discharge from the military in 1952. In a surprise move, however, Brown traded him before the season to the Dallas Texans for fullback Sherman Howard. The trade was unexpected because Cleveland's other guards, including Gaudio and Alex Agase, were getting older and nearing retirement. \\"I'm sure we'll be all right at the guard position,\\" Brown said at the time. \\"But we do have a definite fullback problem.\\" Humble played one season for the Texans before retiring.

His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.\\nAs a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.","target":"John Newton","rationale":"The article mentions that John Newton was born in 1725 and later attended a boarding school as a child.

This suggests that the name of the person who was mistreated at boarding school is \\"John Newton\\", making this answer choice correct."},{"source":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose melody for Sleep Talk was deemed among the best of their career? , can you please find it? \\n\\nOf Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background.

Passage:The Tony-Award-winning  (1988/'96) and The Green Bird (1999), based on a story by Carlo Gozzi, are a two of the composer's theatre works. In 2006, Goldenthal completed his original three-act opera with Taymor entitled Grendel an adaptation of the John Gardner novel of the same name which told the story of Beowulf from the monster Grendel's point of view. It had its world premiere in early June 2006 at the Los Angeles Opera, the role of Grendel performed by Eric Owens, with an audience that included John Williams and Emmy Rossum; the opus was added to the Los Angeles Opera's permanent repertoire and earned Goldenthal a nomination in April 2007 for the Pulitzer Prize for Music. In 2008 Goldenthal reunited with Michael Mann to score 1930s gangster movie Public Enemies and in 2009 he scored another Julie Taymor Shakespeare adaptation, The Tempest. He cites Japanese composer Tōru Takemitsu as an influence and someone he styles his own career on; Goldenthal has said that the lines between traditional concert music and orchestral film score have become more blurred which is the way he thinks it should be.

In 2004, the government introduced a voucher subsidy for pregnant women and, in mid 2005, helped distribute free nets to under-fives in small number of districts, including Rufiji on the southern coast, during a child health campaign. Contributions of these multiple insecticide-treated net delivery strategies existing at the same time and place to coverage in a poor rural community were assessed.   \\n METHODS Cross-sectional household survey in 6,331 members of randomly selected 1,752 households of 31 rural villages of Demographic Surveillance System in Rufiji district, Southern Tanzania was conducted in 2006. A questionnaire was administered to every consenting respondent about net use, treatment status and delivery mechanism.   \\n FINDINGS Net use was 62.7% overall, 87.2% amongst infants (0 to 1 year), 81.8% amongst young children (>1 to 5 years), 54.5% amongst older children (6 to 15 years) and 59.6% amongst adults (>15 years). 30.2% of all nets had been treated six months prior to interview. The biggest source of nets used by infants was purchase from the private sector with a voucher subsidy (41.8%). Half of nets used by young children (50.0%) and over a third of those used by older children (37.2%) were obtained free of charge through the vaccination campaign. The largest source of nets amongst the population overall was commercial purchase (45.1% use) and was the primary means for protecting adults (60.2% use). All delivery mechanisms, especially sale of nets at full market price, under-served the poorest but no difference in equity was observed between voucher-subsidized and freely distributed nets.   \\n CONCLUSION All three delivery strategies enabled a poor rural community to achieve net coverage high enough to yield both personal and community level protection for the entire population. Each of them reached their relevant target group and free nets only temporarily suppressed the net market, illustrating that in this setting that these are complementary rather than mutually exclusive approaches.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract is structured and clearly organized into three sections: (i) background, (ii) methods, and (iii) findings/conclusions.

The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a $42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to $180 from $140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay $90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly $2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled $4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed $538,000 of that amount.

Our previous studies have shown that lysyl oxidase (Lox) is upregulated and functions as an essential factor during bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) -induced C3H10T1/2 cell adipocytic lineage commitment. However, the mechanism of Lox regulation during adipogenic lineage commitment has remained largely unestablished.', 'Samples of adipose tissue from humans with different BMI and C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet were used to compare microRNA-27 (miR-27) expression level associated with obesity. Taqman assays were used for miR-27 expression detection and Oil Red O staining for adipogenesis analysis.', \\"A negative correlation was identified between Lox expression level and miR-27 expression in both BMP4-treated C3H10T1/2 cells and human subcutaneous adipose tissues. A Lox 3' UTR luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-27 directly targeted Lox. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-27 impaired BMP4-induced upregulation of Lox and adipocytic commitment, which could be rescued by overexpression of mature Lox. Conversely, miR-27 inhibition by specific inhibitors increased Lox expression and adipocytic commitment.\\nAnswer: Taken together, these results suggest a novel role for miR-27 in repressing adipogenic lineage commitment by targeting Lox.","target":"Does miR-27 impair the adipogenic lineage commitment via targeting lysyl oxidase?","rationale":"The question should be something like: \\"Does miR-27 impair the adipogenic lineage commitment via targeting lysyl oxidase?\\" It should be answerable from the passage and its answer is unique.

The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost.

Earlier coal-gas methods had been used for lighting since the 1820s, but they were expensive. Gesner's kerosene was cheap, easy to produce, could be burned in existing lamps, and did not produce an offensive odor as did most whale oil. It could be stored indefinitely, unlike whale oil, which would eventually spoil. The American petroleum boom began in the 1850s. By the end of the decade there were 30 kerosene plants operating in the United States. The cheaper, more efficient fuel began to drive whale oil out of the market. John D.

So she says she's personally offended by that and wants to know why. I said that she wasn't in a position to demand a favor after offering to do one for me and then cancelling when the terms were unfavorable, but if she needs help during work hours I am willing to do that . She then asked again for me to reconsider and I said no. She needed me to go to get the credit, she was doubting the turn out would be sufficient.  Am I the asshole?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author of the post suggests that they do not want to attend the event because their coworker had previously offered to babysit for Valentine's Day, but later canceled when they learned it would occur at 8pm. However, in this situation, the author should consider the coworker's position and need for help with the triathlon sponsorship. The coworker offered to babysit before learning that it would occur late on Valentine's Day, but there are no other circumstances around which she canceled. She may have had other plans or commitments that conflicted with her offer to babysit and was unable to reschedule them in time for Valentine's Day.\\\\nTherefore, based on what is stated in the post, it is unclear if there were additional motivations behind why she chose not to babysit due simply because of a scheduling conflict. It is possible that her reason was unrelated and justified; only she really knows why she backed out of watching someone else's children after initially agreeing. For this reason, denying her help simply because she did not follow through on an offer does not seem fair or ethical behavior from an employer toward an employee who may be struggling financially or otherwise needs support from their workplace community members.\\\\nIn addition, based on comments made by the author about needing help during work hours being acceptable but declining any personal favors beyond that being appropriate boundaries shows a lack of consideration toward someone who may be asking for extra support from others due to a difficult situation (even if unknown). Therefore this seems like unfair treatment towards someone who needs emotional support as well as professional assistance during work hours (as described by requesting photo editing services.)\\\\nBased on these considerations alone (without even thinking about how much fun such events can be), it seems clear that \\"the answer\\" here is not just \\"no,\\" but also \\"yes\\" -- Yes!

At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department.

In 2005, Dutta appeared in Kaal, which was a moderate success at the box office. Dutta then appeared in 2005's biggest hit, No Entry opposite actors Anil Kapoor, Salman Khan, Fardeen Khan, Bipasha Basu, Esha Deol and Celina Jaitley. She next appeared in Dosti: Friends Forever which was only an average grosser in India, however became the biggest hit of the year (for a Bollywood film) in overseas markets.  In 2006, Dutta appeared alongside Akshay Kumar in Bhagam Bhag, which was one of the biggest hits of the year, as it collected over Rs400 million (US$6.1 million) in India alone. Her first release of 2007 was Shaad Ali's Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. The film was a box office failure in India but did better overseas, especially in the U.K.  Her later release, Partner became a \\"Blockbuster\\" in India and became the third biggest grosser of the year. Dutta made a special appearance in Om Shanti Om. In 2008, Dutta lent her voice for the animated film, Jumbo. However, the film failed to do well at the box office. She made a special appearance in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Her 2009 release, Blue, was one of the most expensive movies of Indian cinema. Dutta had initially walked away from the project because the movie was entirely shot in the ocean and she did not know how to swim. However the male protagonist Akshay Kumar encouraged her in learning how to swim and she immediately started training with a special coach. Blue was released on 16 October 2009. She stated that \\"The moment I got to know of it, I called Akshay and told him that I wouldn't be able to accept the assignment. He knew the reason behind my decision. Not many people are aware that I had almost drowned while shooting for Andaaz, Akshay had rescued me. When I reminded him I couldn't swim, he told me to forget my phobia and learn swimming pronto,\\" said Dutta. \\"Today, I feel Blue has not merely made me overcome my phobias, but has also taught me something that will stay with me for the rest of my life\\".  Despite a promising opening, the film failed to do well at the box office. She also appeared in Do Knot Disturb, which took a good start at the box office, however dropped in the coming days and failed to do well. Her 2010 release Housefull was a major success across India.

Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead.\\nOne scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \\"I'm dead--take me away.\\"\\nBut there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead.\\nWhat keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \\"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \\"I'm dead,\\" and the other set says, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\"\\nOther scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive.\\nChoe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \\"Wait-I'm not dead yet\\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \\"I'm dead\\" is left. \\"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases  new unique chemicals after death,\\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \\"dead\\" chemical without the \\"not dead yet\\" chemical, they drag away the body.\\nUnderstanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems.

I encourage it to an extent because she lives alone, though I resent it a bit as it deeply stresses him out but if he chooses to spend the whole weekend with me, she usually causes a blowout fight and does something irresponsible(she once bought a car she couldn’t afford after they fought because he wanted a weekend to himself). God forbid we choose to vacation without her the world might end. We have given up multiple opportunities to do things because she would be very angry at him for spending his vacation time away doing something she couldn’t do. She is very manipulative and will bring up how she’s “going to die soon” whenever he wants to spend time without her. \\n\\nOur house is undergoing a remodel currently and when it’s finished I want to bring up the idea of renting the house out for extra income and moving away. Not out of state just somewhere else. We’ve discussed wanting to start a family soon and have expressed that we’d like to have at least one child before I turn 30 or at least before he turns 35. \\n\\nThe thing is I find her to be a terrible mother/grandmother. My husband has two siblings both with 5 year old girls and she’s constantly criticizing their parents decisions, disciplining the kids when it’s not her place etcetc. She’s also obviously very emotionally manipulative and she downright abused them all as children. His two sisters don’t even really spend time around her and she makes it a very big deal that she’s so sad about that. I know myself enough to know if she tried to pull the things she does with her daughters we would have a very bad relationship as I’d easily fly off the handle if she tried to treat my children the way she treats her other grandkids. \\n\\nI feel as if she’s guilting my husband into thinking he has to involve her in our lives and our future child’s life because “everyone else abandoned her”.

When she’s spoken about us having children before she already has inserted herself further into the equation than I’m comfortable with especially given that my family isn’t as close I feel it would be unfair to my family to have her involved as deeply as she expects to be.

Gingivae (commonly called the gums) are soft tissues that line the alveolar processes and surround the necks of the teeth. Teeth are also held in their sockets by a connective tissue called the periodontal ligament. The two main parts of a tooth are the crown, which is the portion projecting above the gum line, and the root, which is embedded within the maxilla and mandible. Both parts contain an inner pulp cavity, containing loose connective tissue through which run nerves and blood vessels. The region of the pulp cavity that runs through the root of the tooth is called the root canal. Surrounding the pulp cavity is dentin, a bone-like tissue. In the root of each tooth, the dentin is covered by an even harder bone-like layer called cementum. In the crown of each tooth, the dentin is covered by an outer layer of enamel, the hardest substance in the body (Figure 23.11). Although enamel protects the underlying dentin and pulp cavity, it is still nonetheless susceptible to mechanical and chemical erosion, or what is known as tooth decay. The most common form, dental caries (cavities) develops when colonies of bacteria feeding on sugars in the mouth release acids that cause soft tissue inflammation and degradation of the calcium crystals of the enamel. The digestive functions of the mouth are summarized in Table 23.4.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- plug\\n\\n- muscles\\n\\n- cartilage\\n\\n- socket\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"socket","rationale":"The paragraph explains that teeth are held in the socket of alveolar processes by a connective tissue called periodontal ligament.

The show was created by Carey, who had both stand-up comedy and writing experience, and Bruce Helford, who was once a writer for Roseanne. It was the first television show to have an episode simulcast on the Internet. Produced by Mohawk Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, it debuted on September 13, 1995, and ranked among the Top 30 programs for four seasons before sliding in popularity.\\n\\nBeginning in season 8, the show rotated through 9 different opening sequences, each of which contained a new version of one of the show's three theme songs. Each theme (\\"Moon Over Parma\\", \\"Five O'Clock World\\" and \\"Cleveland Rocks\\") was seen in three different segments, in new, wildly different arrangements. The show eventually went back to having just five main characters, akin to the first season, as Kate, Mr. Wick, and Steve were eventually written out of the show. Kate's character was married off, Mr. Wick disappeared after three appearances until the Season 8 finale, wherein it is revealed he became a weatherman (although he continued to appear in the opening credits, unlike Kate, who was eliminated completely, and never mentioned again.) Steve left at the beginning of the ninth season to \\"find himself\\".  With Winfred-Louder closed, the location became the office of online retailer Neverending Store. Drew, Mimi, and Mr. Wick were hired as employees of the new company. Mimi was hired first in a similar role to her old job, and Drew was eventually hired as \\"Internal Expediting Analyst\\", and a recurring gag began wherein Drew had no clue as to what his job entailed. Before being written out, Mr. Wick was at first a janitor, and another recurring joke came in the form of Mr. Wick attempting to climb the ladder back to being the boss. Before being written out, he went from janitor to the carrier of the dessert trolley.  Kate left after the first two episodes of season 8, the same two episodes that introduced Kellie, an old high school friend of Drew's who had been working as a stripper. She eventually became a waitress at The Warsaw Tavern, Drew's girlfriend, and the carrier of his child. The plot of the final episode was Drew and Kellie attempting to get married before their child is born. Mr. Wick also returned and stayed on for the series finale.  The show began featuring cameos from reality-TV participants in the final two seasons, such as former Road Rules star Timmy Beggy, The Real World alumna Cara Khan, and The Amazing Race winner Reichen Lehmkuhl. Tony the Bus Driver (Bill Cobbs) became a regular, serving as smart-alecky \\"bartender\\" type to whom Drew could tell his problems. The eighth season was put in a timeslot that frequently clashed with Monday Night Football. It was pulled mid-season and the remaining episodes were shown during the summer of 2003. The ninth season did not air until the summer of 2004, with most of the episodes out of order.  The last season's tone changed radically from the previous seasons. The directors began experimenting with one-camera set-ups, showing the sets completely built, with four walls in most rooms, and with rooms actually linked together. The writers also began experimenting, including story lines in which Gus burns down Mimi's house, forcing her to move in with Drew after Steve leaves her.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"The Drew Carey Show","rationale":"The text describes the American sitcom, \\"The Drew Carey Show\\".\\nIt mentions various characters from the show and uses terms like \\"\\"Neverending Store\\"\\" (a fictionalized version of Amazon) that are specific to the show."},{"source":"You will be given a passage with an enumerated set of facts, a question of form 'Where is <person_name>?', and its answer.

It sailed along the south coast, through Bass Strait, and north along the east coast to overwinter at Port Jackson. It then sailed north up the east coast, rounding the Cape York Peninsula and entering the Gulf of Carpentaria. The ship by then being in extremely poor condition, the survey was broken off and the Investigator was sailed to Koepang, Timor. Many members of the crew became sick with dysentery there, and Flinders took the decision to return to Port Jackson as quickly as possible. They sailed southwards well west of the west coast of Australia, then east along the south coast, arriving back at Port Jackson in June 1802. The Investigator was condemned, and Flinders sailed for England as passenger on the Porpoise, there to ask for a new ship. Though initially inclined to remain at Port Jackson with some of the other naturalists, ultimately Allen chose to board the Porpoise. On 17 August the Porpoise was wrecked on Wreck Reef. Everyone on board was marooned on a sandbank for six weeks while Flinders sailed the ship's cutter back to Port Jackson to seek help. When help arrived it was in the form of two ships, one of which would return to Port Jackson, while the other was en route to China. Allen elected to sail to China. From there he took a passage to England on the Henry Addington.

In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated.

When a warm air mass meets a cold air mass, they don't mix as they have different densities (a bit like oil and water). Instead, the warm less dense air is pushed up over the cold dense air creating the 'front'. Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Describe how does precipitation occur and what determines the type of precipitation that falls to Earth? Precipitation occurs due to the immense collection of water vapor in the form of clouds. When the water vapor in these clouds gets too heavy, it falls. Rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation: 1  Light rain — when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm (0.098 in) per hour. 2  Moderate rain — when the precipitation rate is between 2.5 mm (0.098 in) - 7.6 mm (0.30 in) or 10 mm (0.39 in) per hour. Rain & Floods How does rain form? Water droplets form from warm air. As the warm air rises in the sky it cools. Water vapor (invisible water in the air) always exists in our air. Warm air holds quite a bit of water. For example, in the summer it is usually very humid. When enough of these droplets collect together, we see them as clouds. Most of the condensed water in clouds does not fall as precipitation because their fall speed is not large enough to overcome updrafts which support the clouds. For precipitation to happen, first tiny water droplets must condense on even tinier dust, salt, or smoke particles, which act as a nucleus. Precipitation - Measurement. 1  The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100 mm (4 in) plastic and 200 mm (8 in) metal varieties. [74] 2  Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.

During this time her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush record a more professional demo tape. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who went on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with the Beatles. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater, who signed her.The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts. Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI group-repertoire division. According to Mercer, he felt Bush's material was good enough to release, but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralising and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it.

Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences.\\n\\n- A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet.\\n\\n- Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek  (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from  (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\").\\n\\n- A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. \\n\\n- Recitative (also known by its Italian name \\"recitativo\\") is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition.\\n\\n- Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi (9 or 10 October 1813  27 January 1901) was an Italian opera composer.\\n\\n- A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. \\n\\n- Temistocle Solera (25 December 1815  21 April 1878) was an Italian opera composer and librettist.\\n\\n- Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.\\n\\n- A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral.\\n\\n- An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.\\n\\n- An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage facilities for costumes and set building. While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers.\\n\\n- Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter.\\n\\n- Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.\\n\\n- Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art.\\n\\n- A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir.\\n\\n- The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully.\\n\\n- An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods.\\n\\n- A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. \\n\\n- Oberto , Conte di San Bonifacio is an opera in two acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Temistocle Solera , based on an existing libretto by Antonio Piazza probably called Rocester . It was Verdi 's first opera , written over a period of four years and was first performed at the Teatro alla Scala , Milan , on 17 November 1839 . The La Scala production enjoyed \`\` a fair success '' and the theatre 's impresario , Bartolomeo Merelli , commissioned two further operas from the young composer .\\n\\n- Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode.\\n\\n- Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). \\nThe two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.\\n\\n- Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch.\\n\\n\\n\\n'oberto ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- art\\n - ballet\\n - bible\\n - cantata\\n - choir\\n - culture\\n - dance\\n - design\\n - drama\\n - dramatic\\n - dramatic theory\\n - entertainment\\n - family\\n - gender\\n - genre\\n - history\\n - jazz\\n - libretto\\n - mass\\n - music\\n - musical\\n - opera\\n - operetta\\n - oratorio\\n - orchestra\\n - poetry\\n - popular music\\n - radio\\n - rock\\n - society\\n - song\\n - television\\n - theater\\n - variety\\n - vocal music","target":"drama","rationale":"The question asks which object entity 'oberto' is related to through the relation of a particular word, in this case \\"genre\\".

With a career that spanned nearly 80 years, Hope appeared in more than 70 short and feature films, with 54 feature films with Hope as star, including a series of seven \\"Road\\" musical comedy movies with Bing Crosby as Hope's top-billed partner. In addition to hosting the Academy Awards show nineteen times, more than any other host, he appeared in many stage productions and television roles, and was the author of 14 books.\\nContext: In 1998, five years before his death, a prepared obituary written by the Associated Press inadvertently was released, resulting in Hope's death being announced on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. However, Hope remained in relatively good health until late in his old age, though he became somewhat frail in his last few years. In June 2000, he spent nearly a week in a California hospital being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding. In August 2001, he spent close to two weeks in a hospital recovering from pneumonia.  On the morning of July 27, 2003, Hope died of pneumonia aged 100 at his home in Toluca Lake, California. His grandson Zach Hope told TV interviewer Soledad O'Brien that, when asked on his deathbed where he wanted to be buried, Hope told his wife, Dolores, \\"Surprise me.\\" He was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Garden at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Los Angeles, joined in 2011 by Dolores when she died--four months after her 102nd birthday.

One postulated reason for these conflicting results is an abnormal sensitivity to the intestinal effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D3). Previous studies in everted duodenal sacs and perfused duodenum examined the acute response to 1,25D3 only in 12-week-old SHR, which however already had higher basal rates of calcium absorption. Inability to stimulate Ca absorption further was an unexcluded possibility. To test this hypothesis more vigorously, balance and in situ duodenal 45Ca uptake studies were performed in SHR and WKy using four separate protocols yielding the following results. First, in response to pharmacological doses of 1,25D3 (25 ng/100 g body wt/day X 3), four-week-old normotensive female SHR had higher net calcium absorption (41.4 vs. 31.1 mg/day; 61.6 vs. 48.1%), similar to the increases seen in the untreated state. These results suggest intrinsic epithelial differences independent of 1,25D3. Ca absorption was similarly higher in 1,25D3 treated male SHR (42.9 vs. 36.7 mg/day; 60.1 vs. 53.7%). Second, at 12 to 14 weeks of age, low doses of 1,25D3 (8 ng/100 g body wt/day X 6) stimulated net Ca absorption in the female SHR (33.0 to 39.1 mg/day), but not in WKy (26.8 to 29.3 mg/day). In the male, positive effects were again seen only in the SHR (25 to 45 mg/day). Third, in response to three weeks of dietary Ca deprivation, in situ duodenal 45Ca uptake, measured in the conscious awake state, was higher in 35-week-old SHR (70.9 vs. 53.0%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Response of spontaneously hypertensive rats to 1,25(OH)2D3 in vivo. option2: Emergency physician responsibility for the interpretation of x-rays.","target":"Response of spontaneously hypertensive rats to 1,25(OH)2D3 in vivo","rationale":"The abstract is about the effects of D3 on calcium absorption in SHR and WKy, so the title \\"Response of spontaneously hypertensive rats to 1,25(OH)2D3 in vivo\\" is a better match than \\"Emergency physician responsibility for the interpretation of x-rays\\"."},{"source":"Read the following context and choose the best option to answer the question.\\nContext: Soo I know it 's been a long time that I ' ve said I would post , and FINALLY here I am ! i just got off of work and i ' m kind of exhausted . today i worked in the peds er , and let 's face it , it 's boring as watching grass grow and every kid has a stupid earache and all the parents have the most important kid in the world and their problem is the biggest .\\nQuestion: Where does the author usually work\\nOptions: \\n- At the hospital\\n - As a stay at home mom\\n - None of the above choices .\\n - At a school with kids","target":"At the hospital","rationale":"The context is the author talking about his/her work.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which group of antelope is less adapted to the environment?","target":"group B","rationale":"In the given situation, group A antelope are able to pick fruit and leaves from tall trees more easily than B animals.

He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\".

Outside her office she has taped up a clear plastic suit, and a sign that reads, \\"All employees must don protective gear before coming in.\\" Such is life in limbo. Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices. It could be another year and a half before they return to their old desks. They have contended with difficult working conditions as demand for Legal Aid's services is on the rise because of Sept. 11 and the deteriorating economy. The civil division is spread among a few boroughs. Their papers and documents, some 20,000 boxes worth, are stuck in a storage facility in Linden, N.J. \\"I am counting the days till we can have all the parts back in one place,\\" says Steven Banks, Legal Aid's associate attorney in chief. In the memories of the exiled workers, the old office has achieved mythical proportions. They say the wood paneling and rugs had the ability to cool emotions and lift spirits. The Legal Aid office on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, where 65 displaced workers have cobbled together space amid the faded and scratched walls, looks more like a bargain basement. \\nQuestion: What type of business is the Legal Aid Society? \\nIs it Real estate brokerage?","target":"No","rationale":"The quoted text gives the following description of Legal Aid: \\"the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless\\".

In the present study, we investigated the effects of CVB-D on the inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages in vitro and the underlying mechanisms.', 'Murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells were incubated in the presence of LPS (0.1 μg/mL) for 24 h. The cell viability was measured using MTT assay. The release of NO and cytokines were detected using the Griess test and ELISA, respectively. The mRNA and protein levels were determined using RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Reporter gene assays were used to analyze the transcriptional activity of NF-κB.', 'Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with CVB-D (25-300 μmol/L) did not affect the cell viability. Pretreatment with CVB-D (50, 100 and 200 μmol/L) concentration-dependently decreased NO release and iNOS expression in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells (its IC50 value in inhibition of NO production was 144 μmol/L).

The term 'circus' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Philip Astley is credited with being the 'father' of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The 'traditional' format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s.\\n\\n- Object manipulation is a form of dexterity play or performance in which one or more people physically interact with one or more objects. Many object manipulation skills are recognised circus skills. Other object manipulation skills are linked to sport, magic, and everyday objects or practices. Many object manipulation skills use special props made for that purpose: examples include the varied circus props such as balls, clubs, hoops, rings, poi, staff, and devil sticks; magic props such as cards and coins; sports equipment such as nunchaku and footballs. Any other object can also be used for manipulation skills. Object manipulation with ordinary items may be considered to be object manipulation when the object is used out of its socially acknowledged context and used differently from its original purpose.\\n\\n- H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos.

The performer stands inside the Cyr wheel and grasps its rim , causing it to roll and spin gyroscopically while performing acrobatic moves in and around the rotating wheel . The apparatus and its movement vocabulary have some similarities with the German wheel , but whereas the German wheel consists of two large rings linked together by horizontal crossbars and has handles for the performer to hold onto , the modern Cyr wheel consists of a single ring and has no handles . The Cyr wheel takes its name from Daniel Cyr , who reinvented it as a circus apparatus at the end of the 20th century .\\n\\n- Philip Astley (8 January 1742  27 January 1814) was an English equestrian, circus owner, and inventor, regarded as being the \\"father of the modern circus\\". The circus industry, as a presenter of an integrated entertainment experience that includes music, domesticated animals, acrobats, and clowns, traces its heritage to Astley's Amphitheatre, a riding school that Astley founded in London following the success of his invention of the circus ring in 1768.\\n\\n- Clowns are comic performers who employ slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style.\\n\\n- A trapeze is a short horizontal bar hung by ropes or metal straps from a support. It is an aerial apparatus commonly found in circus performances. Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act.

Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis.\\n\\n- Mining is extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth usually from an orebody, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposits. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.\\n\\n- A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapon). Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (\\"atomic\\") bomb released the same amount of energy as approximately . The first thermonuclear (\\"hydrogen\\") bomb test released the same amount of energy as approximately .\\n\\n- The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .\\n\\n- Knapping is the shaping of flint, chert, obsidian or other conchoidal fracturing stone through the process of lithic reduction to manufacture stone tools, strikers for flintlock firearms, or to produce flat-faced stones for building or facing walls, and flushwork decoration. The original Germanic term \\"knopp\\" meant strike, shape, or work, so it could theoretically have referred equally well to making a statue or dice. Modern usage is more specific, referring almost exclusively to the hand-tool pressure-flaking process pictured.\\n\\n- Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.\\n\\n- Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of science focusing on genomes. A genome is a complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism, and as such genomics is a branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes. Genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of genes, which direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. Proteins in turn make up body structures like organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. If a cell's DNA is mutated, an abnormal protein may be produced, which can disrupt the body's usual processes and lead to a disease such as cancer. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics is the study of genes, their functions, and related techniques, such as applications of recombinant DNA, DNA sequencing methods, and bioinformatics to sequence, assemble, and analyze the function and structure of genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research to understand even the most complex biological systems such as the brain. The field includes efforts to determine the entire DNA sequence of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping. The field also includes studies of intragenomic phenomena such as heterosis, epistasis, pleiotropy and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome. Research carried out into single genes does not generally fall into the definition of genomics unless the aim of this genetic, pathway, and functional information analysis is to elucidate its effect on, place in, and response to the entire genomes networks.\\n\\n- Systems biology is the computational and mathematical modeling of complex biological systems. An emerging engineering approach applied to biological scientific research, systems biology is a biology-based inter-disciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach (holism instead of the more traditional reductionism) to biological research. Particularly from year 2000 onwards, the concept has been used widely in the biosciences in a variety of contexts. For example, the Human Genome Project is an example of applied systems thinking in biology which has led to new, collaborative ways of working on problems in the biological field of genetics. One of the outreaching aims of systems biology is to model and discover emergent properties, properties of cells, tissues and organisms functioning as a system whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques which fall under the remit of systems biology. These typically involve metabolic networks or cell signaling networks.\\n\\n- METeOR (Metadata Online Registry), Australias repository for national metadata standards for health, housing and community services statistics and information. METeOR is a Metadata registry based on the 2003 version of the ISO/IEC 11179 Information technology - Metadata registries standard. METeOR was developed to store, manage and disseminate metadata in the Australian health, community services and housing assistance sectors.\\n\\n- The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.\\n\\n- An arrowhead is a tip, usually sharpened, added to an arrow to make it more deadly or to fulfill some special purpose. The earliest arrowheads were made of stone and of organic materials; as human civilization progressed other materials were used. Arrowheads are important archaeological artifacts; they are a subclass of projectile points. Modern enthusiasts still \\"produce over one million brand-new spear and arrow points per year\\".\\n\\n- A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research. Today there are about 450 nuclear power reactors that are used to generate electricity in about 30 countries around the world.\\n\\n- Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.\\n\\n- In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).\\n\\n- In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.\\n\\n- An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).\\n\\n- The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international scientific research project with the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and of identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome from both a physical and a functional standpoint. It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project. After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the US government when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete in 2003. Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside of government by the Celera Corporation, or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, and China.\\n\\n- A projectile is any object thrown into space (empty or not) by the exertion of a force. Although any object in motion through space (for example a thrown baseball) may be called a projectile, the term more commonly refers to a ranged weapon. Mathematical equations of motion are used to analyze projectile trajectory.\\n\\n- The Spallation Neutron Source ( SNS ) is an accelerator - based neutron source facility that provides the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and industrial development . Each year , this facility hosts hundreds of researchers from universities , national laboratories , and industry , who conduct basic and applied research and technology development using neutrons . SNS is part of Oak Ridge National Laboratory , which is managed by UT - Battelle for the United States Department of Energy ( DOE ) . SNS is a DOE Office of Science user facility , and it is open to scientists and researchers from all over the world .\\n\\n- A neutron source is any device that emits neutrons, irrespective of the mechanism used to produce the neutrons. Neutron source devices are used in physics, engineering, medicine, nuclear weapons, petroleum exploration, biology, chemistry and nuclear power.\\n\\n- Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is an American multiprogram science and technology national laboratory managed for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) by UT-Battelle. ORNL is the largest science and\\nenergy national laboratory in the Department of Energy\\nsystem by surface and by annual budget. ORNL is located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, near Knoxville. ORNL's scientific programs focus on materials,\\nneutron science, energy, high-performance computing,\\nsystems biology and national security.\\n\\n- Spallation is a process in which fragments of material (spall) are ejected from a body due to impact or stress. In the context of impact mechanics it describes ejection or vaporization of material from a target during impact by a projectile. In planetary physics, spallation describes meteoritic impacts on a planetary surface and the effects of a stellar wind on a planetary atmosphere. In the context of mining or geology, spallation can refer to pieces of rock breaking off a rock face due to the internal stresses in the rock; it commonly occurs on mine shaft walls. In the context of anthropology, spallation is a process used to make stone tools such as arrowheads by knapping. In nuclear physics, spallation is the process in which a heavy nucleus emits a large number of nucleons as a result of being hit by a high-energy particle, thus greatly reducing its atomic weight.\\n\\n- Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.\\n\\n- A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.\\n\\n- In the physical sciences, subatomic particles are particles much smaller than atoms. There are two types of subatomic particles: elementary particles, which according to current theories are not made of other particles; and \\"composite\\" particles. Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact.\\n\\n- A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star. It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric.\\n\\n- Radioactive waste is waste that contains radioactive material. Radioactive waste is usually a by-product of nuclear power generation and other applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. Radioactive waste is hazardous to most forms of life and the environment, and is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.\\n\\n- Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies atomic nuclei and their constituents and interactions. The most commonly known application of nuclear physics is nuclear power generation, but the research has led to applications in many fields, including nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear weapons, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.\\n\\n- Geology (from the Ancient Greek , \\"g\\", i.e. \\"earth\\" and -o, \\"-logia\\", i.e. \\"study of, discourse\\") is an earth science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change. Geology can also refer generally to the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars).\\n\\n- In chemistry and physics, nucleons are the proton and the neutron, which are the constituents of the atomic nucleus, and are themselves composed of down and up quarks. The number of nucleons defines an isotope's mass number (nucleon number). The atom is made up of a nucleus surrounded by electrons.\\n\\n- Spall is flakes of a material that are broken off a larger solid body and can be produced by a variety of mechanisms, including as a result of projectile impact, corrosion, weathering, cavitation, or excessive rolling pressure (as in a ball bearing). Spalling and spallation both describe the process of surface failure in which spall is shed.\\n\\n- Energy conservation refers to the reducing of energy consumption through using less of an energy service. Energy conservation differs from efficient energy use, which refers to using less energy for a constant service.\\nDriving less is an example of energy conservation. Driving the same amount with a higher mileage vehicle is an example of energy efficiency. Energy conservation and efficiency are both energy reduction techniques. Energy conservation is a part of the concept of sufficiency.\\n\\n- The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative. DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories.\\n\\n- National security is a concept that a government, along with its parliaments, should protect the state and its citizens against all kind of \\"national\\" crises through a variety of power projections, such as political power, diplomacy, economic power, military might, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'spallation neutron source' and 'tennessee'?","target":"located in the administrative territorial entity","rationale":"Part of the rationale is: \\"located in the administrative territorial entity\\"."},{"source":"Read this and answer the question\\n\\nIn modern color theory, also known as the RGB color model, red, green and blue are additive primary colors.
