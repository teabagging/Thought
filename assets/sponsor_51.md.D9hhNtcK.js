As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.

The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university.\\nBoyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent.\\nWhat kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland?

Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family. Other tough migrants from the South Seas settled along the coasts — sailors, fishermen, traders (for the most part pirates) — known euphemistically as orang laut (sea people).","target":"No","rationale":"The text mentions that people from various parts of the world (South China and Polynesian, Malay peoples) immigrated to Malaysia because they found bountiful food sources there.

Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell.

This  line  of  research  has  been successful by leveraging RL to directly optimizes the desired metrics of the SP tasks – for example, the accuracy in question answering or BLEU score in machine translation.   However, different from the common RL settings, the environment dynamics is deterministic in SP, which hasn’t been fully utilized by the model-freeRL methods that are usually applied. Since SP models usually have full access to the environment dynamics, we propose to apply model-based RL methods, which rely on planning as a primary model component. We demonstrate the effectiveness of planning-based SP with a Neural Program Planner (NPP), which, given a set of candidate programs from a pretrained search policy, decides which program is the most promising considering all the information generated from executing these programs. We evaluate NPP on weakly supervised program synthesis from natural language(semantic parsing) by stacked learning a planning module based on pretrained search policies. On the WIKITABLEQUESTIONS benchmark, NPP achieves a new state-of-the-art of 47.2% accuracy.","target":"A model-based planning component improves RL-based semantic parsing on WikiTableQuestions","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nA model-based planning component improves RL-based semantic parsing on WikiTableQuestions."},{"source":"In this task, you will be given two sentences separated by \\", so\\".

Some cultures have developed entire belief systems around favored animals. Even in cultures with less formal belief systems, connections between people and animals still lead to commonly accepted opinions about animals.\\nThese belief systems usually develop around the animals that interact   with humans most frequently. Therefore, it should not be surprising that so many stories surround the most common of animals: rats. Rats live side by side with humans all over the world and regularly interact with people. Human-rat coexistence may be common all around the world, but different cultures respond to that closeness in different ways.\\nIn the United States and Europe, one typical attitude is that the rat is a pest. This could be due to the common belief that rats spread disease. Actually, they don't, at least not directly, but many people don't know that. The Pied Piper of Hamlin, a well-known children's story, is one example of how rats have been described in Western literature: in that story, rats cause such a problem that a town has to hire a piper to call them all away.\\nIn many Latin American countries, the rat is described in a very different way. The story of the tooth fairy (a fairy believed by children to leave money while they sleep in exchange for a tooth that has come out) is common all over the world, but in Latin America, the \\"fairy\\" is a rat! Rats do have very strong teeth, which could explain the association. Clearly, this shows another attitude toward rats that is much more positive.\\nYet another attitude toward the rat can be seen in the Chinese Zodiac  . The Rat is one of the animals of the Zodiac. Like the other zodiac animals, the Rat is neither entirely good nor entirely bad. It's described as clever and friendly, but also tricky and not entirely honest.

They rely on their well-developed sonar to find their way in the water. Toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted. All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure. Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and beaked whales (ziphiids). There are six species, sometimes referred to as \\"blackfish\\", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).The differences between families of odontocetes include size, feeding adaptations and distribution.\\nMonodontids consist of two species: the beluga and the narwhal.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \\n\\nQuestion: Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago near Lisbon following the orders of which leader?\\nI think \\"Henry the Navigator\\" is a valid answer.

Their music is known for its brand of \\"minimalistic psychedelia\\". Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways.\\n\\nIn November 1985, Spacemen 3 played a gig at a leisure centre in Coventry to an audience of fewer than ten people. Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined that they ought to record a new demo tape. By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones. \\"The band's sound had crystallised into the intense, hypnotic, overloaded psychedelia which characterised their early [record] output, and which would serve as a template for their live act throughout their existence\\" (Ian Edmond, Record Collector).  At Pierce's instigation, Pete Bain rejoined the band on bass in order to fill out their sound. Despite being a 4-piece again, they would retain the name 'Spacemen 3'. Kember and Pierce opted to upgrade their guitar equipment ahead of recording the new demos. Kember purchased a Burns Jazz electric guitar and 1960s Vox Conqueror amplifier; whilst Pierce bought a Fender Telecaster and a 1970s HH amplifier. Both of their new amplifiers included distortion/fuzz and tremolo; these two effects were key components of Spacemen 3's signature sound.  In January 1986, Spacemen 3 attended the home studio of Carlo Marocco at Piddington, outside Northampton, to record their new demo tape. They spent three-and-a-half days at the 16-track studio. Recording live as a group, with minimal overdubs, they managed to get demos for approximately seven songs. Kember and Pierce handled the production. These \\"fine set of performances\\" (Ned Raggett, AllMusic) would later be unofficially released as the vinyl album Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To on the Father Yod label in 1990 (albeit described incorrectly as \\"rehearsals in Rugby\\").  Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a record deal shortly after producing their new demos. Pat Fish had given a copy of the demo tape to Dave Barker, the owner of the independent record label Glass Records, to whom Fish's band The Jazz Butcher were signed.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping...","target":"No","rationale":"The question asks what time three of four Hamburg cell members would arrive soon after.

They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing.

Steppers are an essential part of the complex process, called photolithography, that creates millions of microscopic circuit elements on the surface of tiny chips of silicon. These chips form the heart of ICs such as computer processors, memory chips, and many other devices.\\n\\n- Pentax () is a brand name used primarily by Ricoh Imaging Company for cameras, sport optics (including binoculars and rifle scopes), and CCTV optics. The brand is also used by Hoya Corporation for medical products & services, TI Asahi for surveying instruments, and Seiko Optical Products for certain optical lenses.\\n\\n- A camera lens (also known as photographic lens or photographic objective) is an optical lens or assembly of lenses used in conjunction with a camera body and mechanism to make images of objects either on photographic film or on other media capable of storing an image chemically or electronically.\\n\\n- The Nikon F camera, introduced in April 1959, was Nikon's first SLR camera. It was one of the most advanced cameras of its day. Although many of the concepts had already been introduced elsewhere, it was revolutionary in that it was the first to combine them all in one camera. It was produced until October 1973 and was replaced by the quite similar Nikon F2. Aspects of its design remain in all of Nikon's subsequent SLR cameras, through the current Nikon F6 film and Nikon D5 digital models (which still share its Nikon F-mount for lenses). The \\"F\\" in Nikon F was selected by Nippon Kogaku from the letter F of the name of the designer of the bayonet mount, Mr. Fuketa. That tradition was carried all the way through their top line of Nikon cameras until the introduction of the Nikon D1 (digital) cameras decades later.\\n\\n- Large format refers to any imaging format of 4×5 inches (102×127 mm) or larger. Large format is larger than \\"medium format\\", the 6×6 cm (2×2 inch) or 6×9 cm (2×3 inch) size of Hasselblad, Rollei, Kowa, and Pentax cameras (using 120- and 220-roll film), and much larger than the 24×36 mm (~ 1.0x1.5 inch) frame of 35 mm format.\\nThe main advantage of large format, film or digital, is higher resolution at the same pixel pitch, or same resolution with more larger pixels or grain. A 4×5 inch image has about 16 times the area, and thus 16× the total resolution, of a 35 mm frame.\\n\\n- 35 mm film (millimeter) is the film gauge most commonly used for motion pictures and chemical still photography (see 135 film). The name of the gauge refers to the width of the photographic film, which consists of strips 34.98 ±0.03 mm (1.377 ±0.001 inches) wide. The standard negative pulldown for movies (\\"single-frame\\" format) is four perforations per frame along both edges, which results in 16 frames per foot of film. For still photography, the standard frame has eight perforations on each side.\\n\\n- A microscope (from the , \\"mikrós\\", \\"small\\" and , \\"skopeîn\\", \\"to look\\" or \\"see\\") is an instrument used to see objects that are too small for the naked eye. The science of investigating small objects using such an instrument is called microscopy. Microscopic means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.\\n\\n- , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan.\\n\\n- Nikonos Calypso is the name of a series of 35mm format cameras specifically designed for underwater photography launched by Nikon in 1963. The early Nikonos cameras were improvements of the Calypso camera, which was an original design by Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Belgian engineer Jean de Wouters\\n\\n- Binoculars or field glasses are binocular telescopes mounted side-by-side and aligned to point in the same direction, allowing the viewer to use both eyes (binocular vision) when viewing distant objects. Most are sized to be held using both hands, although sizes vary widely from opera glasses to large pedestal mounted military models.\\n\\n- Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components  electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services. These make Sony one of the most comprehensive entertainment companies in the world. Sony's principal business operations include Sony Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Mobile (formerly Sony Ericsson) and Sony Financial. Sony is among the Semiconductor sales leaders by year and as of 2013, the fourth-largest television manufacturer in the world, after Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and TCL.\\n\\n- Its products include cameras, camera lenses, binoculars, microscopes, ophthalmic lenses, measurement instruments, rifle scopes, spotting scopes, and the steppers used in the photolithography steps of semiconductor fabrication, of which it is the world's second largest manufacturer. The companies held by Nikon form the Nikon Group. Among its products are Nikkor imaging lenses (for F-mount cameras, large format photography, photographic enlargers, and other applications), the Nikon F-series of 35 mm film SLR cameras, the Nikon D-series of digital SLR cameras, the Coolpix series of compact digital cameras, and the Nikonos series of underwater film cameras. Nikon's main competitors in camera and lens manufacturing include Canon, Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic, Pentax, and Olympus.\\n\\n- , better known as Fujifilm or simply Fuji, stylized as FUJiFILM, is a Japanese multinational photography and imaging company headquartered in Tokyo.\\n\\n- Photolithography, also termed optical lithography or UV lithography, is a process used in microfabrication to pattern parts of a thin film or the bulk of a substrate. It uses light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask to a light-sensitive chemical \\"photoresist\\", or simply \\"resist,\\" on the substrate. A series of chemical treatments then either engraves the exposure pattern into, or enables deposition of a new material in the desired pattern upon, the material underneath the photo resist. For example, in complex integrated circuits, a modern CMOS wafer will go through the photolithographic cycle up to 50 times.\\n\\n- Nikkor is the brand of lenses produced by Nikon Corporation, including camera lenses for the Nikon F-mount.\\n\\n- The 70 - 300mm lens is a telephoto zoom lens made by Nikon . The lens has an F - mount to work with all the SLRs line of cameras ( except the early 70 - 300G with the D40 ) . The lens comes in four different versions : AF f / 4 - 5.6G AF f / 4 - 5.6D AF f / 4 - 5.6D ED AF - S f / 4.5 - 5.6G IF - ED It is the successor of the 70 - 210 lens , which targets the prosumer market , one grade lower than 80 - 200mm with large aperture . Introduced in August 2006 , the current incarnation of the lens ( AF - S VR f / 4.5 - 5.6G IF - ED ) improves on the original with VR stabilization technology as well as with internally focusing components ( IF ) . More expensive than its partner 55 - 200mm lens , its construction is similar , with the exterior shell being fabricated from plastic components . It also shares a similarly stiff zoom ring with the 55 - 200mm , although a side benefit of this is that zoom creep is eliminated . Unlike the 55 - 200 , the 70 - 300mm lens is full - frame . Also , the longer barrel length allowed the focus ring to be relocated in front of the zoom ring , making manual focus operations simpler .\\n\\n- Measurement is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event, which can be compared with other objects or events. The scope and application of a measurement is dependent on the context and discipline. In the natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the \\"International vocabulary of metrology\\" published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioral sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'nikon f 70-300mm lens' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of'.

He had his greatest commercial success and popularity from the late 1980s, until the early 1990s. Remembered for his rapid rise to fame, Hammer is known for hit records (such as \\"U Can't Touch This\\" and \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\"), flashy dance movements, choreography and eponymous Hammer pants. A multi-award winner, M.C. Hammer is considered a \\"forefather/pioneer\\" and innovator of pop rap (incorporating elements of freestyle music), and is the first hip hop artist to achieve diamond status for an album.\\n\\nIn the mid-1980s while rapping in small venues and after a record deal went sour, Hammer borrowed US$20,000 each from former Oakland A's players Mike Davis and Dwayne Murphy to start a record label business called Bust It Productions. He kept the company going by selling records from his basement and car. Bust It spawned Bustin' Records, the independent label of which Hammer was CEO. Together, the companies had more than 100 employees. Recording singles and selling them out of the trunk of his car, he marketed himself relentlessly. Coupled with his dance abilities, Hammer's style was unique at the time.  Now billing himself as \\"M.C. Hammer\\", he recorded his debut album, Feel My Power, which was produced between 1986 and 1987 and released independently in 1987 on his Oaktown Records label (Bustin'). It was produced by Felton Pilate (of Con Funk Shun), and sold over 60,000 copies and was being distributed by City Hall Records. In the spring of 1988, a 107.7 KSOL Radio DJ Tony Valera played the track \\"Let's Get It Started\\" in his mix-shows--a song in which he declared he was \\"second to none, from Doug E. Fresh, LL Cool J, or DJ Run\\"--after which the track began to gain popularity in clubs. (He would continue to call out other East Coast rappers in future projects as well.)  Hammer also released a single called \\"Ring 'Em\\", and largely on the strength of tireless street marketing by Hammer and his wife, plus continued radio mix-show play, it achieved considerable popularity at dance clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Heartened by his rising prospects, Hammer launched into seven-day-a-week rehearsals with the growing troupe of dancers, musicians, and backup vocalists he had hired. It was Hammer's stage show, and his infectious stage presence, that led to his big break in 1988 while performing in an Oakland club. There he impressed a record executive who \\"didn't know who he was, but knew he was somebody\\", according to the New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll.  M.C.Hammer had received several offers from major record labels before (which he initially declined due to his personal success), but after the successful release of this independent album and elaborate live dance show amazed the Capitol Records executive, Hammer agreed to sign a record deal soon after. Hammer took home a US$1,750,000 advance and a multi-album contract. It didn't take long for Capitol to recoup its investment.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"MC Hammer","rationale":"The above text is about an American hip hop recording artist, dancer, record producer and entrepreneur named Stanley Kirk Burrell aka MC Hammer."},{"source":"Answer the question depending on the context.\\nContext: Under these complex circumstances regional names are less useful.

It also allows analysts to understand the author’s intended message and to understand the author’s psychology. The theory suggests that human beings possess a nature within them that demonstrates their true “self” and it suggests that the fulfillment of this nature is the reason for living. It also suggests that neurological development hinders actualizing the nature because a person becomes estranged from his or her true self. Therefore, literary devices reflect a characters’s and an author’s natural self. In his ‘‘Third Force Psychology and the Study of Literature’’, Paris argues “D.H Lawrence’s “pristine unconscious” is a metaphor for the real self”.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\".\\n\\nParagraph: Background: The outcome of virus infection depends from the precise coordination of viral gene expression and genome replication. The ability to control and regulate these processes is therefore important for analysis of infection process. Viruses are also useful tools in bio-and gene technology; they can efficiently kill cancer cells and trigger immune responses to tumors. However, the methods for constructing tissue-or cell-type specific viruses typically suffer from low target-cell specificity and a high risk of reversion. Therefore novel and universal methods of regulation of viral infection are also important for therapeutic application of virus-based systems. Methods: Aberrantly spliced introns were introduced into crucial gene-expression units of adenovirus vector and alphavirus DNA/RNA layered vectors and their effects on the viral gene expression, replication and/or the release of infectious genomes were studied in cell culture. Transfection of the cells with splice-switching oligonucleotides was used to correct the introduced functional defect(s). Results: It was demonstrated that viral gene expression, replication and/or the release of infectious genomes can be blocked by the introduction of aberrantly spliced introns. The insertion of such an intron into an adenovirus vector reduced the expression of the targeted gene more than fifty-fold. A similar insertion into an alphavirus DNA/RNA layered vector had a less dramatic effect; here, only the release of the infectious transcript was suppressed but not the subsequent replication and spread of the virus. However the insertion of two aberrantly spliced introns resulted in an over one hundred-fold reduction in the infectivity of the DNA/RNA layered vector. Furthermore, in both systems the observed effects could be reverted by the delivery of splice-switching oligonucleotide(s), which corrected the splicing defects. Conclusions: Splice-switch technology, originally developed for genetic disease therapy, can also be used to control gene expression of viral vectors. This approach represents a novel, universal and powerful method for controlling gene expression, replication, viral spread and, by extension, virus-induced cytotoxic effects and can be used both for basic studies of virus infection and in virus-based gene-and anti-cancer therapy. \\n Title: Novel viral vectors utilizing intron splice- switching to activate genome rescue, expression and replication in targeted cells","target":"False","rationale":"The paragraph provides a summary of the research findings and results.

He started the engine, pulled away from the side of the street and drove down. Being eighty-one years old, he knew he could not fight the gunman. He knew he needed help. Where were the police?

In the present work, a rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-Q-TOF-MS)-based metabolomics was conducted to investigate the intervention effect of Schisandra chinensis lignans (SCL) on hyperlipidemia mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD).   \\n METHODS Hyperlipidemia mice were orally administered with SCL (100 mg/kg) once a day for 4 weeks. Serum biochemistry assay of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) was conducted to confirm the treatment of SCL on lipid regulation. Metabolomics analysis on serum samples was carried out, and principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were carried out for the pattern recognition and characteristic metabolites identification. The relative levels of critical regulatory factors of liver lipid metabolism, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and its related gene expressions were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for investigating the underlying mechanism.   \\n RESULTS Oral administration of SCL significantly decreased the serum levels of TC, TG and LDL-c and increased the serum level of HDL-c in the hyperlipidemia mice, and no effect of SCL on blood lipid levels was observed in control mice. Serum samples were scattered in the PCA scores plots in response to the control, HFD and SCL group. Totally, thirteen biomarkers were identified and nine of them were recovered to the normal levels after SCL treatment. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis, the anti-hyperlipidemia mechanisms of SCL may be involved in the following metabolic pathways: tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, synthesis of ketone body and cholesterol, choline metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. Meanwhile, SCL significantly inhibited the mRNA expression level of hepatic lipogenesis genes such as SREBP-1c, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and decreased the mRNA expression of liver X receptor α (LXRα). Moreover, SCL also significantly decreased the expression level of SREBP-2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in the liver of hyperlipidemia mice.   \\n CONCLUSION Anti-hyperlipidemia effect of SCL was confirmed by both serum biochemistry and metabolomics analysis.

Yamoussoukro , the capital of Côte d'Ivoire , is located adjacent from the Bandama River .\\n\\n- Longitude (or , Australian and British also ), is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface. It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in degrees and denoted by the Greek letter lambda (). Meridians (lines running from the North Pole to the South Pole) connect points with the same longitude. By convention, one of these, the Prime Meridian, which passes through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England, was allocated the position of zero degrees longitude. The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian, ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to +180° eastward and 180° westward. Specifically, it is the angle between a plane containing the Prime Meridian and a plane containing the North Pole, South Pole and the location in question. (This forms a right-handed coordinate system with the axis (right hand thumb) pointing from the Earth's center toward the North Pole and the axis (right hand index finger) extending from Earth's center through the equator at the Prime Meridian.)\\n\\n- Cape Lopez is a 55 km-long peninsula on the coast of west central Africa, in the country of Gabon.

Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth.\\nApproximations employed.\\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.\\n\\n- Gabon, officially the Gabonese Republic, is a sovereign state on the west coast of Central Africa.

One year previously, Claire had been involved in a serious car accident that leaves gaps in her memory. Combined with her daughter Caitlin's (Katharine Towne) departure for college, this leaves Claire profoundly affected.\\nThe Spencers â who have moved into the former home of Norman's father â live next door to the Feurs, who have just moved in and frequently engage in loud arguments. Overhearing Mary Feur (Miranda Otto) sobbing one day, Claire becomes concerned. When she sees Mary's husband Warren (James Remar) seemingly dragging something that resembles a body bag in the middle of the night and putting it in the trunk of the car, she suspects that Mary has been murdered.\\nClaire decides to investigate. After nobody answers the door, she walks around the side of the house and discovers a woman's sandal with a dark stain on it. Claire begins spying on Warren with the help of her best friend Jody (Diana Scarwid). However, Claire soon witnesses strange occurrences when she is alone in the house and becomes convinced that Mary is dead and haunting her.\\nDesperate for closure, and facing little sympathy from Norman, Claire invites Jody to join her for a sÃ©ance in her bathroom, where she thinks she'll be able to communicate with Mary's ghost. Although the sÃ©ance provides no results, after Jody leaves, Claire finds a message in the bathroom's mirror that reads \\"You know\\".\\nAn anxious Claire goes to Norman's office to inform him of the event, but he instead believes she's trying to call for his attention because he's been busy at work.

Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out.

The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.","target":"The Fairy-Queen","rationale":"The article is talking about the concert at The Old Vic as it contains a lot of information regarding this event.

The son of a Romani witch, Von Doom has been depicted as a supervillain, the archenemy of the Fantastic Four, and the leader of the fictional nation called Latveria. While his chief opponents have been the Fantastic Four, he has also come into conflict with Spider-Man, Iron Man, Black Panther, and multiple others. Von Doom has also been depicted as a superhero, being the third character to take up the mantle of Iron Man and joining the Avengers.\\n\\nRapper MF DOOM bases his persona on Victor von Doom.  In the book Superhero: The Secret Origin of a Genre, Peter Coogan writes that Doom's original appearance was representative of a change in the portrayal of \\"mad scientists\\" to full-fledged villains, often with upgraded powers. These supervillains are genre-crossing villains who exist in adventures \\"in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended\\"; characters such as Professor Moriarty, Count Dracula, Auric Goldfinger, Hannibal Lecter, Joker, Lex Luthor, and Darth Vader, also fit this description. Sanderson also found traces of William Shakespeare's characters Richard III and Iago in Doom; all of them \\"are descended from the 'vice' figure of medieval drama\\", who address the audience in monologues detailing their thoughts and ambitions.  Described as \\"iconic\\", Doom is one of the most well-received characters of the Marvel Universe, as well as one of the most recurring; in his constant battles with other heroes and other villains, Doctor Doom has appeared more times than any other character. The comics site Panels of Awesome ranked Doctor Doom as the number one villain in their listing of the top ten villains in comics; Wizard Magazine went a step further by declaring Doctor Doom the fourth greatest villain of all time.  Comic Book Resources ranks Victor von Doom as their fourth favorite Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him being able to \\"stand up against entities like Mephisto, the Beyonder, and Galactus and often comes out on top\\", as well as the tragedy of any \\"other number of circumstances could have led to Doctor Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvel's greatest villain.\\", a fact that later led to the character's redemption. Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his \\"master[ing] of sorcery and technology an unusual combination\\", and also felt \\"his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to Magneto.\\" Von Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying that Doom \\"could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has diplomatic immunity. Also, he wants to rule the world and if you think about it, wanting to rule the world is not a crime.\\", that Doom technically isn't a villain. Mark Waid echoed Lee's assessment of the character, stating that Doom \\"[has] got a great look, a great visual design [and] a dynamite origin.\\"  A ride called Doctor Doom's Fearfall is located at Islands of Adventure in the Universal Orlando Resort.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Doctor Doom","rationale":"The context is about the superhero Doctor Doom, who was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.","target":"Yes","rationale":"The Sogas were a powerful Japanese clan that ruled Japan in the 6th and 7th century.

Full citizens, or \\"freemen\\", were accorded full rights and privileges in areas such as voting and holding office. To be considered a freeman, adult males had to be sponsored by an existing freeman and accepted by the General Court. Later restrictions established a one-year waiting period between nominating and granting of freeman status, and also placed religious restrictions on the colony's citizens, specifically preventing Quakers from becoming freemen. Freeman status was also restricted by age; the official minimum age was 21, although in practice most men were elevated to freeman status between the ages of 25 and 40, averaging somewhere in their early thirties.

Furthermore, English judges in the eighteenth century subscribed to now-obsolete natural law theories of law, by which law was believed to have an existence independent of what individual judges said. Judges saw themselves as merely declaring the law which had always theoretically existed, and not as making the law.

Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals.

I'm there to get an A and the credit, don't quite give a shit about going above and beyond. The classes I actually care about I put in genuine time and effort into, and actually learn something useful. English is not one such class, especially when it involves old literature that curriculums still administer. I'm taking AP Literature this year not because I give a damn about literature, but because I want the AP credit to pad my transcript and make college easier later on. The class, as I expected, is extremely boring and honestly hasn't taught me anything of value since starting. We've spent 3 weeks just reading through the intricacies of Hamlet, which I spent napping or playing on my phone. In the end, we didn't even do much with Hamlet, a short 30 question quiz and a couple of questions on the unit test. At this point, all the shits I've given about the class as a whole has gone down the drain, I bs all the assignments that are given and I do just fine. I have better things to spend my time on, so all things related to AP Literature are punted to the bottom of my priority list of stuff I do every day. I do my best to keep that list short, and normally English is the last thing I want to add to it. \\n\\nThis leads to what happened today, right before class I check the calendar outside next to the door and see that we have another quiz coming up this Friday that I have to study for. I let out an audible sigh and sound of disgust in a semi-joking fashion, I already had plenty of shit lined up from other classes I needed to do. Apparently my English teacher, we'll call her Mrs. D, heard me and got very triggered. At first, I thought she was joking when she said something to the effect of \\"trust me I don't want to be here either\\". About 5 minutes later in class, she walked out and called for me to come out as well. I don't remember the whole following conversation very well, but I remember a few select words she used. She said I was rude and had a superiority complex, claiming that I thought I was better than everyone else in the class. Adding on that I am also the most obnoxious person in the class, that I don't contribute to group/partner assignments, and I don't stay engaged with everything. \\n\\nWhat she said does have some merit, so I'll provide two perspectives to see this situation from, mine and Mrs. D's.\\n\\nMrs. D is absolutely horrendous at teaching and her class provides no academic value to me besides the credit and grade. She doesn't actually teach anything, we just pile through book after book and story after story without learning anything useful. A majority of her assignments are almost completely redundant: a 4-page personal journal every two weeks, a random literary term quiz here and there, and multiple-choice problems that are loosely tied to what we read that she never explains. I've stopped giving a shit and normally catch up on much-needed sleep or scroll through Reddit on my phone to stave off boredom during long reading times. I do carry my weight whenever I need to, and contrary to her claim, I also contribute to group and partner activities. I do the assignments given, usually with full marks. I'm not doing badly in the class, floating at a 97 with a couple pending grades that may drop it a point or two. \\n\\nFrom Mrs. D's perspective, I'm a lazy student who doesn't care about her class, which is wholly true. I play on my phone or fall asleep during reading times, and have no respect for the sparing assignments she does give the class. I'm not engaged with everything she discusses and I bullshit everything. I openly showed my disgust to her stuff and barely gave her my minimum level of respect. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI've never been so shaken in a conversation with a teacher in a long time, I'm generally on good terms with all of my other teachers, even becoming a teacher's assistant for one and a class ambassador with another. At the end of the class, I cratered and offered a sincere apology for my apparently shitty behavior. I was genuinely sorry in some aspects, but mostly I just wanted to end any potential animosity that lingers and take a morally commendable route. \\n\\nSo the question remains, am I the asshole?

This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.","target":"Joe","rationale":"Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus.

Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction.\\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.\\n\\nThey also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\\n\\n\\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"\\n\\nSome of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.\\n\\n\\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.\\n\\nChief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\"\\nQuestion: Why did people argue that accessing a cellphone without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. not enough information\\n\\nB. it would be a case of unreasonable search and seizure\\n\\nC. it would be a case of lacking freedom of speech\\n\\nD. it would be a case of hacking\\n\\n===\\nThe correct answer is","target":"B","rationale":"The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution prevents unreasonable searches and seizures.

Often billed as \\"America's Number One Song Stylist\\", his other nicknames include \\"Mr. Rhythm\\", \\"Old Leather Lungs\\", and \\"Mr. Steel Tonsils\\".

The label soon folded, and Laine was picked up by Atlas Records, a \\"race label\\" that initially hired him to imitate his friend Nat \\"King\\" Cole. Cole would occasionally \\"moonlight\\" for other labels, under pseudonyms, while under contract to \\"Capitol\\", and as he had previously recorded some sides for Atlas, they reasoned that fans would assume that \\"Frankie Laine\\" was yet another pseudonym for \\"Cole.\\"  Laine cut his first two numbers for Atlas in the King mode, backed by R&B artist Johnny Moore's group, The Three Blazers which featured Charles Brown and Cole's guitarist (from \\"The King Cole Trio\\"), Oscar Moore. The ruse worked and the record sold moderately well, although limited to the \\"race\\" market. Laine cut the remainder of his songs for Atlas in his own style, including standards such as \\"Roses of Picardy\\" and \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\".  It was also at this time that he recorded a single for Mercury Records: \\"Pickle in the Middle with the Mustard on Top\\" and \\"I May Be Wrong (But I Think You're Wonderful).\\" He appears only as a character actor on the first side, which features the comedic singing of Artie Auerbach (a.k.a., \\"Mr. Kitzel\\") who was a featured player on the Jack Benny radio show.

They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police.Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery. Salnish, who often went under the name Jacob Fogel, had been an active revolutionary since the age of 13. He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.\\n\\nParagraph: Ted had two farmlands. Hill land had good mycorrhizal colonization because ted used cover crops, while Meadow land had fewer AM fungi present in the soil.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which land didn't have extended time for AM growth into the spring?","target":"Meadow","rationale":"The paragraph introduces two farmlands, Hill and Meadow. The first sentence states that the Hill land had good mycorrhizal colonization because of cover crops, while the second sentence says that Meadow land has fewer AM fungi present in soil. \\nWe can infer from these facts that Ted did not use cover crops on his Meadow land. Since using a cover crop allows for extended time for AM growth into autumn, winter and spring (as mentioned in background), it follows that since there were no cover crops on the Meadowland then this farmland would have lacked an extension to its growing season unlike Hill which is described as having \\"good\\" mycorrhizal colonization due to this additional time period during which fungus was able to grow effectively around plant roots through techniques such as endomychorization"},{"source":"In this task you are given a medical question pair hand-generated.

The movement is in da capo form: the first section is repeated after a contrasting middle section. It is scored for three \\"choirs\\": one of trumpets, another of strings and bassoon, and a four-part chorus. The number three, symbolizing the Trinity, appears again in the 3/8 time signature and in the use of three trumpets. The first part opens with trumpet fanfares, alternating with flowing coloraturas in the strings. The voices enter as a third homophonic choir. They repeat the first measure of the fanfare motif on the word \\"Erschallet\\" (resound!), as the trumpets echo the motif. The voices repeat the motif from the second measure of the fanfare on \\"ihr Lieder\\", and the trumpets echo it again. The chorus repeats measures 3 and 4 on \\"erklinget, ihr Saiten\\", commanding the strings to play. As a culmination, the first syllable of \\"seligste Zeiten\\" (most blessed times) is held on a seventh chord (first in measure 53), during which the instruments play their motifs.In the middle section in A minor the trumpets rest while the other instruments play colla parte with the voices.

Passage:Marriott signed for League Two club Luton Town on a one-year contract on 20 May 2015. He made his debut as a 76th-minute substitute for Danny Green in a 1–1 draw away to Accrington Stanley on the opening day of 2015–16. Marriott scored his first goals for Luton in the following match, a 3–1 win at home to newly promoted Championship club Bristol City in the League Cup first round. This performance saw him named in the League Cup team of the round. Marriott signed a contract extension with Luton on 25 August until June 2017, with triggers to extend it for a further two years. He was shown a red card for making a gesture to the Leyton Orient fans in Luton's 2–1 win in the Football League Trophy on 1 September. Luton manager John Still, who was adamant he didn't deserve the red card said, \\"He shouldn't have done it but the punishment didn't fit the crime.\\" Marriott scored a brace in consecutive substitute appearances against AFC Wimbledon and Hartlepool United, which resulted in two wins in a week to increase his tally for the season to six goals. He went on to score twice in 20 appearances, including a goalless drought of 10 matches, before scoring a consolation goal in a 4–1 defeat away to AFC Wimbledon on 13 February 2016.

Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.With the death of Zhengde and ascension of Jiajing, the politics at court shifted in favor of the Neo-Confucian establishment which not only rejected the Portuguese embassy of Fernão Pires de Andrade (d. 1523), but had a predisposed animosity towards Tibetan Buddhism and lamas. Evelyn S. Rawski, a professor in the Department of History of the University of Pittsburgh, writes that the Ming's unique relationship with Tibetan prelates essentially ended with Jiajing's reign while Ming influence in the Amdo region was supplanted by the Mongols.The Chinese Ming dynasty also deliberately helped to propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. The Ming assisted Altan Khan, King of the Tümed Mongols, when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism.Meanwhile, the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region (modern Qinghai), raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan (1507–1582). Klieger writes that Altan Khan's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet. After Altan Khan made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571, he invited the third hierarch of the Gelug—Sönam Gyatso (1543–1588)—to meet him in Amdo (modern Qinghai) in 1578, where he...","target":"Altan Khan","rationale":"The passage describes the relationship between Ming China and Tibet.

April 2] 1743 - July 4, 1826) was an American Founding Father who was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and later served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Previously, he was elected the second Vice President of the United States, serving under John Adams from 1797 to 1801. A proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights motivating American colonists to break from Great Britain and form a new nation, he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level.\\n\\nAt the start of the Revolution, Jefferson was a Colonel and was named commander of the Albemarle County Militia on September 26, 1775. He was then elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776, when finalizing a state constitution was a priority. For nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which forbade state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine. The bill failed to pass, as did his legislation to disestablish the Anglican church, but both were later revived by James Madison.  In 1778, Jefferson was given the task of revising the state's laws. He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to streamline the judicial system. Jefferson's proposed statutes provided for general education, which he considered the basis of \\"republican government\\". He had become alarmed that Virginia's powerful landed gentry were becoming a hereditary aristocracy. He took the lead in abolishing what he called \\"feudal and unnatural distinctions.\\" He targeted laws such as entail and primogeniture by which the oldest son inherited all the land. The entail laws made it perpetual: the one who inherited the land could not sell it, but had to bequeath it to his oldest son. As a result, increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by black slaves, gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern (\\"Tidewater\\") tobacco areas. During the Revolutionary era, all such laws were repealed by the states that had them.  Jefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780. He transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond, and introduced measures for public education, religious freedom, and revision of inheritance laws.  During General Benedict Arnold's 1781 invasion of Virginia, Jefferson escaped Richmond just ahead of the British forces, and the city was burned to the ground. General Charles Cornwallis that spring dispatched a cavalry force led by Banastre Tarleton to capture Jefferson and members of the Assembly at Monticello, but Jack Jouett of the Virginia militia thwarted the British plan. Jefferson escaped to Poplar Forest, his plantation to the west. When the General Assembly reconvened in June 1781, it conducted an inquiry into Jefferson's actions which eventually concluded that Jefferson had acted with honor--but he was not re-elected.  In April of the same year, his daughter Lucy died at age one. A second daughter of that name was born the following year, but she died at age three.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: When he became governor?","target":"Jefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.","rationale":"The context mentions that Jefferson was elected as governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.\\nTherefore, the answer is: \\"Jefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.\\""},{"source":"Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to $10 from $5 and in circuit court to $20 from $10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is $50.50, and in circuit court $108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about $1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.''

According to another study , the Gross-functional product development teams, can achieve a great quality and better cost benefits from socializing and interacting with individuals who work for their suppliers.\\nThe first, Dr. Bohlmann's study analyzed cross-functional product development teams, which combine together engineers, researchers and business personnel. The point to involve people with various backgrounds was to show that there was a focus on finance, marketing, and also on a design and functionality, right from the start of the product-development process. In addition to all this, this diversity also helped to make communication more effective in order to ensure that all members of the team were socializing and cooperating, and not just working at cross-purposes.\\nAs a result, it indicated that \\"interactional fairness awareness\\" indeed had an effect on a \\"cross-functional communication.\\" In other words, all the team members who thought that they had been treated well and respected, showed a great increase in their commitment to the success of the project they had been working on in cooperation with other team members, and, in particular, when they realized their project manager or supervisor to be a kind, nice and honest guy.\\nAccording to Dr. Bohlmann, the increase in such commitment is very essential and important because it could improve performance that would result in the achievement of team goals. And if Bohlmann's study comes to the conclusion that nice and honest guys are the first to finish, the second research by Dr. Rob Handfleld shows us that cooperating and socializing well with others can give a team, and even a company an edge, when it comes...\\nQuestion: What effect can the commitment mentioned by Dr. Bohlmann have on our work?\\nOptions: A: Ensuring great quality of product.\\nB: Giving a team, and even a company an edge.\\nC: Making communication effective.\\nD: Helping us perform better.","target":"D","rationale":"The article is about making a good career in a business environment.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nParagraph: Peter decided to sugar mangoes, ginger, pineapples, peaches to preserve them for next spring. He also bought blueberries and raspberries to eat fresh.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit had a higher sugar content, mangoes or raspberries?","target":"mangoes","rationale":"The paragraph describes a process called \\"sugaring\\", which is the act of packing fruit or other foods with sugar to preserve them. Because raspberries already have high levels of sugars, there would be no need for Peter to pack them in more sugar in order to preserve them. On the contrary, mangoes are not as sweet and could benefit from an extra boost of sweetness before being preserved by sugaring. So it's safe to assume that mangoes had a higher sugar content than raspberries prior to preservation."},{"source":"Write the response.

The ablation zone is the region where there is a net loss in glacier mass. The equilibrium line separates the ablation zone and the accumulation zone; it is the altitude where the amount of new snow gained by accumulation is equal to the amount of ice lost through ablation. The upper part of a glacier, where accumulation exceeds ablation, is called the accumulation zone. In general, the accumulation zone accounts for 60–70% of the glacier's surface area, more if the glacier calves icebergs. Ice in the accumulation zone is deep enough to exert a downward force that erodes underlying rock. After a glacier melts, it often leaves behind a bowl- or amphitheater-shaped depression that ranges in size from large basins like the Great Lakes to smaller mountain depressions known as cirques.\\n\\nWhat characteristics determine glacial zones?","target":"surface snowpack and melt conditions","rationale":"The glacier is broken into zones based on the surface snowpack and melt conditions.

Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made with the intention of commercial use was built by the American inventor Thomas Davenport, which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and Davenport went bankrupt. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues. No electricity distribution had been developed at the time.

Specifically, we know that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetric here, then perhaps a magnetic field can create a current. The Hall effect is a voltage caused by a magnetic force. That voltage could drive a current. Historically, it was very shortly after Oersted discovered currents cause magnetic fields that other scientists asked the following question: Can magnetic fields cause currents? The answer was soon found by experiment to be yes. In 1831, some 12 years after Oersted’s discovery, the English scientist Michael Faraday (1791–1862) and the American scientist Joseph Henry (1797–1878) independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating emfs (electromotive force) and, hence, currents with magnetic fields is known as induction; this process is also called magnetic induction to distinguish it from charging by induction, which utilizes the Coulomb force. Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society. The ubiquitous generator—found in automobiles, on bicycles, in nuclear power plants, and so on—uses magnetism to generate current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances. Not so familiar perhaps, but important nevertheless, is that the behavior of AC circuits depends strongly on the effect of magnetic fields on currents.\\n\\n\\nQ: What does the ubiquitous generator use to generate currents?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- inertia\\n\\n- water\\n\\n- gravity\\n\\n- magnetism\\n\\nA:","target":"magnetism","rationale":"A generator is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

He has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years. Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur career, Woods was 20 years old when he turned professional at the end of summer in 1996. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters.\\n\\nWhen Woods first joined the PGA Tour in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf. However, when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance), many opponents caught up to him. Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using \\"inferior equipment\\", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, made him one of the Tour's lengthiest players off the tee once again.  Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.  From mid-1993 (while he was still an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began to pay off in 1999. From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 and was replaced by Sean Foley.  Fluff Cowan served as Woods' caddie from the start of his professional career until Tiger fired him in March 1999. He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts. In June 2011, Woods fired Williams and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after and has remained Woods' caddie since then, but he has seen very limited work.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"when did his style become famous to the world","rationale":"The article states that Woods had a large impact on the world of golf when he first joined PGA tour.\\nTherefore, \\"when did his style become famous to the world\\" is an appropriate question for this passage"},{"source":"In this task, we ask you to write an answer to a question about when an event happened.

Pamela was educated by governesses in the ancestral home at Minterne Magna in Dorset, along with her three younger siblings. Her great-great aunt was the nineteenth-century adventurer and courtesan Jane Digby (1807-1881), notorious for her exotic travels and scandalous personal life. Pamela was to follow in her ancestor's footsteps, being frequently cited as \\"the 20th-century's greatest courtesan.\\"\\n\\nIn 1939, while working at the Foreign Office in London doing French-to-English translations, Pamela met Randolph Churchill, the son of Winston Churchill. Randolph proposed to her on the very evening they met, and they were married on 4 October 1939. Two days after Randolph Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, their son Winston was born. Shortly after giving birth, Pamela and the newborn were photographed by Cecil Beaton for Life magazine, its first cover of a mother with baby.  In February 1941, Randolph was sent to Cairo for military service, where he accrued large gambling debts. His letter to Pamela asking her to make good on his liabilities, along with her affair with W. Averell Harriman, combined to shatter their marriage, but the fault probably lay on both sides. Harriman was known at Chequers by the French phrase habitue de la maison for his frequent stays there in 1941. Harriman was one of the aristocratic set from the US Embassy, charming, suave and sophisticated. They had developed a friendship during the London Blitz, so that by 17 April 1941 they were already close and intimate friends. Jack Colville, Churchill's private secretary was well aware of the affair, but their clandestine relationship had to wait thirty years before consummation in marriage. She completed the circle by becoming a US citizen. Her father-in-law however, was too busy visiting bombed-out Blitz sites to be overly-concerned in 1941.  During 1944 she worked in the Cabinet's war rooms on a secretive SOE mission for Operation Bodyguard working with Robert E. Sherwood. \\"The days at the office were very sorry,\\" wrote Bobby Bevan, a spy who was directly involved with Bodyguard's activities; long days stretched into lonely nights, when they frequently indulged the senses on champagne and Russian caviar. Bodyguard went ahead without allied knowledge or approval, which upset the Soviets. At a critical point prior to the Top Secret D-Day Normandy landings, allied intelligence feared Germany's strength in the Mediterranean; a diversionary attack on the Balkans was designed to distract the Nazis in France. This further encouraged Churchill to switch sides to Tito's Partisans. After the war, Randolph had an affair with Bevan's wife. Eventually, Pamela filed for divorce in December 1945 on the grounds that Randolph had deserted her for three years. Later, after having converted to Catholicism, she obtained an annulment from the Catholic Church.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Pamela Harriman","rationale":"The text is a biography of Pamela Harriman, and every sentence in the passage refers to her."},{"source":"In this task, you are given two sets, and you need to count the number of elements at the intersection of two given sets.

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.\\n\\nTwo geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data.\\n\\nWhich researcher studied more about plucking of the underlying rock?","target":"Danny","rationale":"The passage describes the differences between glaciated and non-glaciated environments. Glaciers are responsible for producing sediment, called glacial flour, through abrasion of their underlying rock bed by plucking. Glacial erosion is also responsible for creating U-shaped valleys. Non-glaciated areas do not show this behavior because they have never been exposed to glaciers in the first place - meaning that there has been no activity like plucking or abrasion which would create a landscape where U shaped valleys form from V shaped ones.\\nGiven these facts about both types of environment, we can determine who studied more about 'plucking'. Danny researched on glaciated areas while Manny did otherwise so it is likely that if one of them had researched significantly more than the other on 'plucking"},{"source":"Given a sentence, fill out the missing word with a 'no' or a number (between zero and ten).

In the present Father Jacob (Willie C.

Using four-leaf clover laced holy water Jacob manages to banish the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after drops dead of injuries inflicted by the Leprechaun during the fight.One year later two down on their luck friends Emily Woodrow (Tangi Miller) and Lisa Duncan (Sherrie Jackson) have their fortune told when the clairvoyant Esmeralda (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil.

The genotype of mouse had a marked effect on the overall degree of vacuolation and on the shape of the lesion profile: these effects were more profound with some agents than others. In certain areas of the brain, depending upon the strain of agent used, the (C57BL × VM)F1 cross was found to have either significantly more or significantly less vacuolation than either parental genotype.

He stepped down from these and other positions by a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Through inheritance, he brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia.\\n\\nIn 1506, Charles inherited his father's Burgundian territories, most notably the Low Countries and Franche-Comte. Most of the holdings were fiefs of the German Kingdom (part of the Holy Roman Empire), except his birthplace of Flanders, which was still a French fief, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the Hundred Years' War. As he was a minor, his aunt Margaret of Austria (born as Archduchess of Austria and in both her marriages as the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent, as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515. She soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles' requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528.  From 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of Frisian peasants (led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijard Jelckama). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523.  Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of Tournai, Artois, Utrecht, Groningen and Guelders. The Seventeen Provinces had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were fiefs of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a Pragmatic Sanction, declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs.  The Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles V personally they were his home, the region where he was born and spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the wealth of the region's cities, the Low Countries also represented an important income for the Imperial treasury.  The Burgundian territories were generally loyal to Charles throughout his reign. The important city of Ghent rebelled in 1539 due to heavy tax payments demanded by Charles. The rebellion did not last long, however, as Charles's military response, with reinforcement from the Duke of Alba, was swift and humiliating to the rebels of Ghent.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor","rationale":"The given text is about the life and reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.

If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans.\\nWith the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches.\\nOn Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\".

He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the \\"Father of the Texas Blues\\". Jefferson's performances were distinctive because of his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists.\\n\\nJefferson was born blind (or possibly partially blind), near Coutchman, Texas. He was the youngest of seven (or possibly eight) children born to Alex and Clarissa Jefferson, who were sharecroppers. Disputes regarding the date of his birth derive from contradictory census records and draft registration records. By 1900, the family was farming southeast of Streetman, Texas, and his birth date is indicated as September 1893 in the 1900 census. The 1910 census, taken in May, before his birthday, further confirms his year of birth as 1893 and indicated that the family was farming northwest of Wortham, near his birthplace.  In his 1917 draft registration, Jefferson gave his birth date as October 26, 1894, further stating that he then lived in Dallas, Texas, and had been blind since birth. In the 1920 census, he is recorded as having returned to Freestone County and was living with his half-brother, Kit Banks, on a farm between Wortham and Streetman.  Jefferson began playing the guitar in his early teens and soon after he began performing at picnics and parties. He became a street musician, playing in East Texas towns in front of barbershops and on street corners. According to his cousin Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for Blind Lemon Jefferson, Classic Sides:  They were rough. Men were hustling women and selling bootleg and Lemon was singing for them all night... he'd start singing about eight and go on until four in the morning... mostly it would be just him sitting there and playing and singing all night.  In the early 1910s, Jefferson began traveling frequently to Dallas, where he met and played with the blues musician Lead Belly. Jefferson was one of the earliest and most prominent figures in the blues movement developing in the Deep Ellum section of Dallas. It is likely that he moved to Deep Ellum on a more permanent basis by 1917, where he met Aaron Thibeaux Walker, also known as T-Bone Walker. Jefferson taught Walker the basics of playing blues guitar in exchange for Walker's occasional services as a guide. By the early 1920s, Jefferson was earning enough money for his musical performances to support a wife and, possibly, a child. However, firm evidence of his marriage and children has not been found.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he have family, then?","target":"However, firm evidence of his marriage and children has not been found.","rationale":"The answer to the question is: \\"However, firm evidence of his marriage and children has not been found.\\" since it contains information regarding his family."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament.\\nVirtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.\\n\\n- Charlie's Angels is an American crime drama television series that aired on ABC from September 22, 1976 to June 24, 1981, producing five seasons and 110 episodes.

She is easily bored, uninterested in her husband's career or in anything to do with her current circumstances. She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people. For over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge. Tired of waiting for him to ask her to marry and move to Chicago, Rosa extorts money from Lewis' patients - who often do not have cash but pay him in produce or in other non-financial ways - to finance her trip to the city.\\nLewis does not yet know about the affair, but he is used to his wife's unease with her life; he discovers the extortion and throws the cash at her, telling her that if she goes to Chicago, she need not come back. Rosa immediately leaves and fully expects Latimer to welcome her. However, he avoids her at first, then when he does meet her, he tells her he is love with another woman and intends to marry. Devastated, Rosa returns to Wisconsin, where Lewis forgives her. She soon becomes pregnant and, briefly, seems to be trying to settle down.\\nDuring a party for Moose, the man who tends to the hunting lodge, Latimer shows up. He lets Rosa know that he has changed his mind and wants to marry her. Moose overhears the couple planning for her divorce and their marriage; the next day, as everyone is heading out on a hunting trip, Moose bets that her lover will not want the baby and advises Rosa that she had better tell Latimer about it, or he will. To prevent that eventuality, she shoots and kills Moose during the hunt. She is acquitted of this act by claiming she thought he was a deer.","target":"she thought he was a deer","rationale":"Rosa shoots Moose in order to prevent him from revealing her secret affair with Mr. Latimer, as well as the fact that she is pregnant with his child.

If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube.

Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains.

Its watershed of 855 square miles ( 2,210 km2 ) includes an important timber - producing region of Oregon that was the site of the Tillamook Burn . In its upper reaches it flows through a long narrow valley of small mountain communities but is unpopulated along most of its lower reaches inland from the coast . It rises in the northeast corner of Tillamook County , in the Tillamook State Forest . It initially flows northeast , across the northwest corner of Washington County and into western Columbia County , past Vernonia where it receives Rock Creek and Pittsburg . At Pittsburg , it looks to the northwest and west into Clatsop County , then flows southwest back into northern Tillamook County . It enters Nehalem Bay on the Pacific in an estuary at Nehalem , about 70 miles ( 110 km ) west - northwest of Portland . Near its mouth on the Pacific , the river passes under U.S. Route 101 . It receives the Salmonberry River from the east in northern Tillamook County . It also receives the North Fork Nehalem River 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the north about 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) northwest of Nehalem , just before entering Nehalem Bay .

The Oregon Coast is not a specific geological, environmental, or political entity, but instead includes the entire coastline of Oregon, including the Columbia River Estuary.\\n\\n- A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins.

At long, it is the largest tributary of the Columbia River, the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean. Rising in western Wyoming, the river flows through the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho, then through the rugged Hells Canyon area via northeastern Oregon and the rolling Palouse Hills, to reach its mouth near the Washington Tri-Cities area, where it enters the Columbia. Its drainage basin encompasses parts of six U.S. states, and its average discharge is over .\\n\\n- The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province.\\n\\n- A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean.

An oppressive, acrid smoke filled the neighboring valleys; ashes, and cinders, and the charred needles of trees fell in the streets of Tillamook; and debris from the fire reached ships at sea. The loss in processed lumber was estimated to have been $442.4 million in contemporary (1933) dollarsa serious loss not only to the timber industry at the time, but also to a nation struggling with the Great Depression.

As the Swift boats reached the Cửa Lớn River, Kerry's boat was hit by a B-40 rocket (rocket propelled grenade round), and a piece of shrapnel hit Kerry's left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the Gulf of Thailand safely.

The primary port for the operation was Quanzhou in Fujian, then the center of China's maritime trade. They landed on Komodahama beach on Tsushima Island on October 5, 1274. Sō Sukekuni, governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement. The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded Iki. Tairano Takakage, the Governor of Iki, fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen, but he killed himself after his unit was defeated. The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in Hakata Bay, a short distance from Dazaifu, the ancient administrative capital of Kyūshū. The following day brought the Battle of Bun'ei , also known as the \\"First Battle of Hakata Bay\\". The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong. Later accounts have both sides believing themselves to be drastically outnumbered by the enemy; the Yuanshi provides an estimate of 102,000 for the Japanese force, while the Japanese Hachiman Gudokun describes the invaders as outnumbering the Japanese 10 to 1.

To see how his GMO crop compare with another crop he selected crop B. Crop B was a non-GMO crop. Keith needed to find the pros and cons of both crops.\\n\\nWhich crop would more likely be virus resistant, crop A or crop B?\\n\\nHint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...","target":"crop A","rationale":"Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate.

Adults generally meet only to court and mate (though limited noncourting socialization has been observed anecdotally) and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, which range from 25 to 40 km2 in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory of a male can contain those of several females. The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.Like the other big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn territorial and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that of two or three females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.The jaguar is often described as nocturnal, but is more specifically crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.","target":"crepuscular","rationale":"Given the context, crepuscular is the answer because it means \\"Active at twilight or during dawn and dusk\\"."},{"source":"Sentence: How can I keep picture frames from scratching the wall?\\n\\nChoice 1: Put dabs of hot glue on the front corner of the frames.\\n\\nChoice 2: Put dabs of hot glue on the back corner of the frames.\\n\\nWhat is the index of the correct choice for ending for the sentence?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"2","rationale":"Put dabs of hot glue on the back corner of the frames.\\nBy adding weight to a picture frame, it is less likely to fall off or be pushed in from kids and pets touching them.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.","target":"No","rationale":"The lungs are the main part of the respiratory system. The diaphragm, which is a dome-shaped muscle located at the bottom of your ribs and separating your chest from your abdomen, helps you breathe by expanding (inhaling) and contracting (exhaling).\\nWhen inhale takes place, it increases size of chest so question should have been 'What leads to increase in size of chest while inhaling'.

Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment.

Now scientists have discovered the same thing happens with the songs of another creature----the humpback whale. The mammals become absorbed by new tunes just like people do, and the most popular original whale songs spread globally like hit singles.\\nMale humpback whales are famed for the loud, long and complicated songs they make during the mating season. Each song lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and the males can sing nonstop for 24 hours. At any one time, all the males in a population sing the same song.\\nBut a study shows that this song changes over time and spreads around the oceans. Dr. Ellen Garland of Queensland University, said: \\"Songs move like cultural communication from one population to another, causing all males to change their song to a new version.\\"\\nResearchers recorded songs from six neighboring populations of whales in the Pacific over a decade. They found that new versions of the songs appear over time and always spread from west to east.

In directing Skyfall and Spectre, Mendes became the first director to oversee two consecutive Bond films since John Glen directed The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill in 1987 and 1989. Skyfall writer John Logan resumed his role of scriptwriter, collaborating with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who returned for their sixth Bond film.[N 4] The writer Jez Butterworth also worked on the script, alongside Mendes and Craig. Dennis Gassner returned as the film's production designer, while cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema took over from Roger Deakins.

He has an older sister, Lytrell Bundy, who works in a bank. Music was always present in Brown's life beginning in his childhood. He would listen to soul albums that his parents owned, and eventually began to show interest in the hip-hop scene.\\nContext: After being signed to Jive Records in 2004, Brown began recording his self-titled debut studio album in February 2005. By May, there were 50 songs already recorded, 14 of which were picked to the final track listing. The singer worked with several producers and songwriters--Scott Storch, Cool & Dre and Jazze Pha among them--commenting that they \\"really believed in [him]\\". Brown also made some input on the album, receiving co-writing credits of five tracks. \\"I write about the things that 16 year olds go through every day,\\" says Brown. \\"Like you just got in trouble for sneaking your girl into the house, or you can't drive, so you steal a car or something.\\" The whole album took less than eight weeks to produce.  Released on November 29, 2005, the self-titled Chris Brown album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 154,000 copies. Chris Brown was a relative commercial success with the time; selling over two million copies in the United States--where it was certified two times platinum by the RIAA--and three million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \\"Run It!\\", made Brown the first male act (since Montell Jordan in 1995) to have his debut single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot 100--later remaining for four additionally weeks. Three of the other singles--\\"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\\", \\"Gimme That\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\"--peaked within the top twenty at the same chart.  On June 13, 2006, Brown released a DVD entitled Chris Brown's Journey, which shows footage of him traveling in England and Japan, getting ready for his first visit to the Grammy Awards, behind the scenes of his music videos and bloopers. On August 17, 2006, to further promote the album, Brown began his major co-headlining tour, The Up Close and Personal Tour. Due to the tour, production for his next album was pushed back two months. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received $10,000 in ticket proceeds from Brown's 2006 \\"Up Close & Personal\\" tour. Brown has made appearances on UPN's One on One and The N's Brandon T. Jackson Show on its pilot episode.  In January 2007, Brown landed a small role as a band geek in the fourth season of the American television series The O.C.. Brown then made his film debut in Stomp the Yard, alongside Ne-Yo, Meagan Good and Columbus Short on January 12, 2007. In April 2007, Brown was the opening act for Beyonce, on the Australian leg of her The Beyonce Experience tour. On July 9, 2007, Brown was featured in an episode of MTV's My Super Sweet 16 (for the event, it was retitled: Chris Brown: My Super 18) celebrating his eighteenth birthday in New York City.  In November 2007, Brown starred as a video host for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Math-A-Thon program. He showed his support by encouraging students to use their math skills to help children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases. Shortly after ending his summer tour with Ne-Yo, Brown quickly began production for his second studio album, Exclusive, which was released in the United States on November 6, 2007. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 294,000 copies in its first week, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. As of March 23, 2011, it has sold over 1.9 million copies in the United States. The album's lead single, \\"Wall to Wall\\", peaked at number 79 on US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number 22 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \\"Kiss Kiss\\", featuring and produced by T-Pain, was released as the album's second single. It reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and became Brown's second number one single following \\"Run It!\\" in 2005. \\"With You\\", a song produced by Stargate, was released as the third single from Exclusive, and reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.  On November 21, 2007, Brown appeared in This Christmas, a family drama starring Regina King. To further support the album Exclusive, Brown embarked on his The Exclusive Holiday Tour, visiting over thirty venues in United States. The tour began in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 6, 2007, and concluded on February 9, 2008, in Honolulu, Hawaii. In March 2008, Brown was featured on Jordin Sparks' single \\"No Air\\", which peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. He also made a guest appearance on Ludacris' single \\"What Them Girls Like\\" alongside Sean Garrett. The song peaked at number 17 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number eight on the US Hot Rap Songs chart. Brown re-released Exclusive on June 3, 2008, as a deluxe edition, renamed Exclusive: The Forever Edition, seven months after the release of the original version. The re-released version featured four new tracks, including the single \\"Forever\\", which reached number two on Billboard Hot 100. In August 2008, Brown guest-starred on Disney's The Suite Life of Zack & Cody as himself. In October 2008, he was featured on T-Pain's single \\"Freeze\\", from his third studio album Thr33 Ringz. Towards the end of 2008, Brown was named Artist of the Year by Billboard magazine.  In 2008, Brown began work on his-then upcoming third studio album. According to him, he would experiment a different musical direction for his new album--titled Graffiti--while hoping to emulate singers Prince and Michael Jackson. He stated, \\"I wanted to change it up and really be different. Like my style nowadays, I don't try to be typical urban. I want to be like how Prince, Michael and Stevie Wonder were. They can cross over to any genre of music.\\" The album's lead single \\"I Can Transform Ya\\" was released on September 29, 2009. The song peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number 11 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \\"Crawl\\" was released as the album's second single on November 23, 2009. The song reached number 53 on the Billboard Hot 100. Graffiti was then released on December 8, 2009. The album debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 102,000 copies in its first week, but received generally negative reviews from critics. As of March 23, 2011, it has sold 341,000 copies in the United States.  While performing a Michael Jackson Tribute at the 2010 BET Awards, Brown started to cry and fell to his knees while singing Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\". The performance and his emotional turmoil resonated with several celebrities present at the ceremony, including Trey Songz, Diddy and Taraji P. Henson. Songz said, \\"He left his heart on the stage. He gave genuine emotion. I was proud of him and I was happy for him for having that moment\\". Michael's brother, Jermaine Jackson, expressed similar sentiments stating, \\"it was very emotional for me, because it was an acceptance from his fans from what has happened to him and also paying tribute to my brother\\". Later during the award ceremony, Brown stated, \\"I let y'all down before, but I won't do it again...I promise\\", while accepting the award for the AOL Fandemonium prize.  In May 2010, Brown released a collaborative mixtape with Tyga, titled Fan of a Fan. \\"Deuces\\", which features Tyga and Kevin McCall, was released from the mixtape in the United States on June 29, 2010. The song peaked at number one on US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven non-consecutive weeks, giving Brown his first number-one on the chart since his 2006 hit single, \\"Say Goodbye\\". It also peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In August 2010, Brown starred alongside an ensemble cast, including Matt Dillon, Paul Walker, Idris Elba, Hayden Christensen and T.I. in the crime thriller Takers, and also served as executive producer of the film.\\nQuestion: was that album successful?.
