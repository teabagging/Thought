They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.\\n\\nand the situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.\\n\\nAnswer the following question: Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B?","target":"crop B","rationale":"Crop A is herbicide tolerant and crop B is not. So, for a given amount of weeds both crops would need different amounts of chemicals to control the growth of weeds in their fields. Since chemical tolerance was bred into Crop A (by genetic engineering), it could withstand more chemical applications as compared to crop B that had no such feature built-in by nature or breeding techniques.\\nTherefore, we can expect that crop B needs more number of chemicals than crop A to maintain its yield during weed infestation seasons while keeping damage caused due to these chemicals low."},{"source":"In this task you are given a medical question pair hand-generated.

To this end, there has been increasing interest in characterizing and generating interpretable behavior of the agent. An alternative approach to guarantee that the agent generates interpretable behavior would be to design the agent's environment such that uninterpretable behaviors are either prohibitively expensive or unavailable to the agent. To date, there has been work under the umbrella of goal or plan recognition design exploring this notion of environment redesign in some specific instances of interpretable of behavior. In this position paper, we scope the landscape of interpretable behavior and environment redesign in all its different flavors. Specifically, we focus on three specific types of interpretable behaviors -- explicability, legibility, and predictability -- and present a general framework for the problem of environment design that can be instantiated to achieve each of the three interpretable behaviors.

Four Seasons may have better rooms in terms of architecture and the modern facility, but the location is not desirable (too many homeless wandered nearby and didn't feel safe at night). Nothing stands out at the Ritz; it has no view and its location is mediocre; services were good but the decor is a bit stuffy, old school like, typical of the Ritz chain. The view, services, and location at the MO makes it the best choice for me.I stayed at the Bridge to Bridge View room in July 2006 and the Golden Gate Bridge Mandarin King in August 2007. The main difference is that the Mandarin King has a bathroom with the tub by a large window with fantastic view. From the 48th floor, watching clouds rolling in below us and birds flying by the window, we felt like we were in an airplane. The sky bridge on every floor provides panoramic view of the entire city. Check out my photos for the amazing view.The services at the MO are always top notch. It's not the kind of hotel to nickel and dime its guests (unlike many other five star hotels). The business center offers computers with free internet access and printing (FS and the Ritz charge like $10 for 15 minutes). Also, I called up the room service to inquire about the name of the complementary wine we received upon arrival and was instead offered another complementary bottle. Housekeeping services were good and discreet.Its location is the best compared to the the FS and the Ritz. It's close to Embarcadero and the clock tower, next to a cable car line and the Bart station, within walking distance to Chinatown and the downtown shopping area.The food from the room services were quite good but the taxes, services charges, and gratuity accounted for a third of the bill. I didn't like the fact the the invoice include both 18% gratuity and services charges of $2.5/person, it seems like double charging but at least it's disclosed properly.Overall, the hotel is worth splurging for the best rooms and we plan to come back every summer.\\nquestion: How nice is the view?","target":"a large window with fantastic view","rationale":"The correct answer to the question is \\"a large window with fantastic view,\\" because it provides details about the nice view."},{"source":"Given two sentences regarding the stereotypes of religions, determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about $30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about $1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise...\\nBased on the previous passage, How was Usama cut off from the funds of the  Bin Laden family? \\nIs \\"Government froze the assets\\" a correct answer?","target":"Yes","rationale":"Based on the previous passage, How was Usama cut off from the funds of the  Bin Laden family?\\nIs \\"Government froze the assets\\" a correct answer?\\n\\n\\nAnswer is Yes.

This gives a theoretical Carnot efficiency of about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station.

I live with my dad, rent-free, and earn money by doing housekeeping chores and making sure my younger siblings (all still in school) don't die. I'm well aware that I'm lucky I have such a decent living situation considering my age and lack of future planning, and that it's all because my dad loves his kids too much to just kick them out on the street.\\n* The pay system in our household is simple; you do your chores every day all week (save for days where you're literally \\"i'm vomiting\\" sick), you get paid. No exceptions. Chore allowance is $20, but I make an extra $30 for the babysitting. So, I make at least $30 a week regardless of whether I keep up with the housekeeping or not as long as, again, none of my siblings die.\\n* I'll be the first to admit I'm not the most consistent when it comes to the housekeeping I'm supposed to do. I suffer from depression that was diagnosed but never properly treated and most days I just don't have the motivation to get up and do anything at all, but I always make a point to at least get the dishes done so we can all eat. I also try to get my siblings to do their chores so my dad doesn't wake up (he works nights, so he sleeps most of the day) to a pigsty, but for the last couple months, they've been infuriatingly neglectful of them.\\n* We have four pets (three turtles that share a tank and one snake) that are classified as family pets though the snake is technically my brother's because he's the one that caught it (Dad's rule is that if you catch it, you can keep it as long as it's within reason; apartment rules allow for cage critters, so Dad allowed it). As family pets, everyone has to pitch in and make sure they're all cared for; even my Dad, who does his part by making sure there's always food for them and changing the turtle water monthly when the filters just aren't enough to keep it clean anymore.\\n* Normally, I wouldn't even consider asking to be paid for their care, but as I mentioned before, my siblings are really stubborn about chores. That includes animal care. That leaves me as the only active caretaker of them and, frankly, I don't actually consider them *my* pets. No one consulted me about bringing them in. They just showed up and I see it more as pet-sitting on my part and I've started thinking that if I'm going to be only one of the kids that takes care of the animals, then I might as well get paid for it.\\n\\nSo, would I be an a-hole if I asked my dad to add the animal care to my official chore list or am I within reason?","target":"asking to be paid extra for taking care of the family pets","rationale":"The author of the post is unsure whether it is fair to ask their father for additional payment for taking care of the family pets.

Passage:Born on August 21, 1883, in Hadley, Indiana, Clark arrived in eastern Idaho Territory in 1884. His father Joseph engineered an early canal on the Snake River and later became the first Mayor of Idaho Falls, Idaho in 1900. Clark attended the public schools and left Idaho Falls High School at age 15 and then attended school in Terre Haute, Indiana. Clark returned to Idaho Falls working as a mercantile clerk, then moved to Mackay, Idaho shortly after its founding and saved money to attend the University of Michigan Law School, but did not graduate but instead read law to enter the bar in 1904. He entered private practice in Mackay from 1904 to 1930. He was a Judge Advocate General for the State of Idaho from 1914 to 1915. Clark left to fight in 1916 in the Border War and then World War I.

First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded).

It is defined as a constrained optimization problem which maximizes the information the representation has about the task, I(T;Y), while ensuring that a minimum level of compression r is achieved (i.e., I(X;T) <= r). For practical reasons the problem is usually solved by maximizing the IB Lagrangian for many values of the Lagrange multiplier, therefore drawing the IB curve (i.e., the curve of maximal I(T;Y) for a given I(X;Y)) and selecting the representation of desired predictability and compression. It is known when Y is a deterministic function of X, the IB curve cannot be explored and other Lagrangians have been proposed to tackle this problem (e.g., the squared IB Lagrangian). In this paper we (i) present a general family of Lagrangians which allow for the exploration of the IB curve in all scenarios; (ii) prove that if these Lagrangians are used, there is a one-to-one mapping between the Lagrange multiplier and the desired compression rate r for known IB curve shapes, hence, freeing from the burden of solving the optimization problem for many values of the Lagrange multiplier.","target":"We introduce a general family of Lagrangians that allow exploring the IB curve in all scenarios.

Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.\\n\\nWhereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball, and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.  It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The king set out by the River Thames on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End. The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and William Walworth, the mayor of London, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \\"I am your captain, follow me!\\", he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.  The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.  It is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals. One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor (King of Bohemia Charles IV) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.  Michael de la Pole had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's favourite. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.  Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions. Instead, a so-called crusade led by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, was dispatched, which failed miserably. Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, Scotland. In 1385, the king himself led a punitive expedition to the north, but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle. Meanwhile, only an uprising in Ghent prevented a French invasion of southern England. The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of Castile in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person. With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckingham - who had by now been created Duke of Gloucester - and Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel.  The threat of a French invasion did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386. At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Pole - in his capacity of chancellor - requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed. The parliament (later known as the Wonderful Parliament) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel. The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request. Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go. A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.  Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a \\"gyration\\" (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause. By installing de Vere as Justice of Chester, he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in Cheshire. He also secured a legal ruling from Chief Justice Robert Tresilian that parliament's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable.  On his return to London, the king was confronted by Thomas of Woodstock (now Duke of Gloucester), Arundel and Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who brought an appeal of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, Tresilian, and two other loyalists: the mayor of London, Nicholas Brembre, and Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York. Richard stalled the negotiations to gain time, as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements. The three earls then joined forces with Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby (Gaunt's son, later King Henry IV), and Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham - the group known to history as the Lords Appellant. On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at Radcot Bridge, where he and his forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country.  Richard now had no choice but to comply with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were condemned and executed, while de Vere and de la Pole - who had by now also left the country - were sentenced to death in absentia at the Merciless Parliament in February 1388. The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley. The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","target":"The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country,","rationale":"The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country,\\nSo this is interesting since it indicates that after the peasants were allowed to go home they still caused more trouble."},{"source":"In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the general math.

His compositions \\"Spain\\", \\"500 Miles High\\", \\"La Fiesta\\" and \\"Windows\\", are considered jazz standards. As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed the fusion band Return to Forever.\\n\\nIn the early 1970s, Corea took a profound stylistic turn from avant-garde to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz with Return to Forever. Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American styles more than on rock music. On their first two records, Return to Forever consisted of Flora Purim on vocals, Joe Farrell on flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums , and Stanley Clarke on double bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by the Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I Known You Before, No Mystery, and Romantic Warrior.  Corea's composition \\"Spain\\" appeared on the 1972 Return to Forever album Light as a Feather. This is probably his most popular piece, and it has been recorded by a variety of artists. There are also a variety of recordings by Corea himself. These included an arrangement for piano and symphony orchestra that appeared in 1999 and a collabration with vocalist Bobby McFerrin on the 1992 album Play. Corea usually performs \\"Spain\\" with a prelude based on Joaquin Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez (1940), which earlier received a jazz orchestration on Davis and Gil Evans' Sketches of Spain.  In 1976, he issued My Spanish Heart, influenced by Latin American music and featuring vocalist Gayle Moran (Corea's wife) and electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday.

The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) initiated a protocol to assess the efficacy of hormonal therapy of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH). Primary goals of the first phase (Part A) were to prospectively determine reproducibility of referring institution's pathologist's diagnosis of AEH by a panel of 3 gynecologic pathologists and to determine reproducibility of diagnoses by panel members.   \\n METHODS Three hundred six women were entered on this protocol with a referring institution's pathologist diagnosis of AEH based on biopsy or curettage. Available slides were assessed independently and interpreted by each of a panel of 3 gynecologic pathologists who used International Society of Gynecologic Pathologists (ISGP)/World Health Organization criteria. The majority diagnosis was based on diagnostic concordance by at least 2 of the 3 panelists.   \\n RESULTS The referring institution's pathologist's diagnosis of AEH was supported by the majority of the panel in only 38% of cases. Overall kappa value for the panel diagnosis of AEH was 0.28. The majority diagnosis was adenocarcinoma in 29%, cycling endometrium in 7%, and nonatypical hyperplasia in 18% of cases. Unanimous agreement for any diagnosis was reached among all 3 of the panel in 40% of cases. For the panel, paired kappa values for any diagnosis ranged 0.34-0.43, with an overall kappa value of 0.40.   \\n CONCLUSION Reproducibility of referring institution's pathologists' diagnosis of AEH by a panel of gynecologic pathologists is poor. Both underestimation and overestimation of the severity of the lesion are very common. The level of reproducibility among subspecialist panel members for diagnosis of AEH in these specimens also is poor.

Patients who had received thrombolytic therapy were excluded. Patients were divided into four groups depending on the status of the left anterior descending artery and the presence or absence of a left ventricular aneurysm: Group I (n = 25): aneurysm with occluded left anterior descending artery; Group II (n = 27): no aneurysm and occluded left anterior descending artery; Group III (n = 23): no aneurysm and patent left anterior descending artery; and Group IV (n = 4): aneurysm with patent left anterior descending artery. Single vessel disease was more common in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Groups II and III (no aneurysm) (chi 2(4) = 12.8; probability value equal to 0.012). Collateral blood supply in the presence of an occluded left anterior descending artery was significantly less in Group I (aneurysm) compared with Group II (no aneurysm) (0.9 versus 2.4, p less than 0.001). The extent of coronary artery disease and collateral blood supply in Groups I and II were directly related (p = 0.012). Neither age, sex nor risk factors for coronary disease correlated with aneurysm formation. At a mean follow-up of 48 months, no differences were observed in the incidence of recurrent angina, new myocardial infarction, embolic events or sudden death. More patients in Group II underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery in association with inherent poor collateral blood supply is a significant determinant of aneurysm formation after anterior myocardial infarction. Multivessel disease with either good collateral circulation or a patent left anterior descending artery is uncommonly associated with the development of left ventricular aneurysm. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Determinants of left ventricular aneurysm formation after anterior myocardial infarction: a clinical and angiographic study. option2: Timing of symptoms and oocyst excretion in human cryptosporidiosis.","target":"Determinants of left ventricular aneurysm formation after anterior myocardial infarction: a clinical and angiographic study","rationale":"The correct title for the abstract is \\"Determinants of left ventricular aneurysm formation after anterior myocardial infarction: a clinical and angiographic study\\", not \\"Timing of symptoms and oocyst excretion in human cryptosporidiosis\\" because the latter is completely irrelevant to the content of the abstract."},{"source":"Determine the topic of the question-answer pair.\\nQuestion: \\"Where Are Mahindra Tractors Made?\\";  Answer: \\"Mahindra has a huge consumer base in India, China and America and a growing base in Australia.\\"?

Four of the deadliest spiders in the world are the following. These spiders should undoubtedly be avoided.\\nBrown Recluse Spider\\nThe brown recluse spider is native to the United States. It prefers areas that are dark and quiet. They can be found both indoors and outside. Their characteristic marking is a dark violin shape on top. The brown recluse spider is not an aggressive spider, but will inject venom into its victims if it is pressed against the skin. In children, the elderly, and those with lowered immune systems, the venom will cause serious illness or death.\\nBlack Widow Spider\\n  The black widow can be found in the southeastern United States. Their characteristic marking is a red hourglass   shape on their black stomach. It is not an aggressive spider. The black widow injects a neurotoxin   into its victims. The neurotoxin can interfere with nerves to muscle tissue. In children and the elderly, the neurotoxin can be fatal.\\nBrazilian Wandering Spider\\n  The Brazilian wandering spider has a few names such as the banana spider and the armed spider. They can be found in the regions of Central and South America where the climate is warm. These are highly aggressive spiders and are extremely dangerous. They wander around the forest floor and are commonly found in people's homes. It injects a neurotoxin which can cause death.\\nSydney Funnel-Web Spider\\n  The Sydney funnel-web spider resides near Sydney, Australia. They can grow to 3 inches in length and have a dark and smooth body. They are extremely aggressive and are the most poisonous spiders. They will strike repeatedly, possibly causing death by injecting a neurotoxin into their victims.\\nThese four species of spiders are not all aggressive, but all can cause painful bites and serious bad reactions.

Passage:At the same time that Walter was developing submarine engines, he was also applying his ideas to rocketry. The high-pressure gas mixture created by the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide could not only be used in a turbine, but if simply directed out of a nozzle, created considerable thrust. Wernher von Braun's rocketry team working at Peenemünde expressed interest in Walter's ideas, and in 1936 began a programme of installing Walter rockets into aircraft. The experimental results obtained by von Braun created interest among Germany's aircraft manufacturers, including Heinkel and Messerschmitt, and in 1939, the Heinkel He 176 became the first aircraft to fly on liquid-fuelled rocket power alone. This type of engine went on to become the cornerstone of the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered fighter, when married to Alexander Lippisch's revolutionary airframe design. Throughout the course of World War II, Walter's aircraft engines became increasingly powerful and refined. The original design of simply decomposing hydrogen peroxide was soon changed to its use as an oxidizer (much like dinitrogen tetroxide would be used later) when combined with a hydrazine/methanol true rocket fuel designated C-Stoff, into the hot, high-pressure gases, and in later, never-deployed developments, a second, 400 kg (880 lb) thrust \\"cruising\\" combustion chamber, nicknamed a Marschofen, was added below the main chamber to allow for more precise control of the engine.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\nQuestion: Which historical event was compared to releasing prisoners from Cuba?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial.  He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.\\n\\nWe propose a framework to understand the unprecedented performance and robustness of deep neural networks using field theory. Correlations between the weights within the same layer can be described by symmetries in that layer, and networks generalize better if such symmetries are broken to reduce the redundancies of the weights. Using a two parameter field theory, we find that the network can break such symmetries itself towards the end of training in a process commonly known in physics as spontaneous symmetry breaking. This corresponds to a network generalizing itself without any user input layers to break the symmetry, but by communication with adjacent layers. In the layer decoupling limit applicable to residual networks (He et al., 2015), we show that the remnant symmetries that survive the non-linear layers are spontaneously broken based on empirical results. The Lagrangian for the non-linear and weight layers together has striking similarities with the one in quantum field theory of a scalar. Using results from quantum field theory we show that our framework is able to explain many experimentally observed phenomena, such as training on random labels with zero error (Zhang et al., 2017), the information bottleneck and the phase transition out of it (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017), shattered gradients (Balduzzi et al., 2017), and many more.","target":"Closed form results for deep learning in the layer decoupling limit applicable to Residual Networks","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nClosed form results for deep learning in the layer decoupling limit applicable to Residual Networks"},{"source":"Math problem: Solve -36*z = -12*z + 118 - 46 for z.\\nWhat is the solution?","target":"-3","rationale":"-36z = -12z + 118 - 46\\n\\nSimplifying the left-hand side of the equation:\\n\\n24z = 72 - 46  (Subtracting 12*2 from both sides)"},{"source":"In this task, you are given a sentence from the research paper and the category to which it belongs.

Awarding the record the title of \\"platter du jour\\" (i.e. album of the month), Spin observed that \\"with traces of classical, operatic, tribal and twisted pop styles, Kate creates music that observes no boundaries of musical structure or inner expression\\". The review noted \\"while her eclecticism is welcomed and rewarded in her homeland her genius is still ignored here – a situation that is truly a shame for an artist so adventurous and naturally theatrical\\", and hoped that \\"this album might gain her some well-deserved recognition from the American mainstream\\". However, Rolling Stone, in their first ever review of a Kate Bush record, was unimpressed: \\"The Mistress of Mysticism has woven another album that both dazzles and bores.

Fyodor's association with many of the leading figures in Russian music, including Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky, meant that Igor grew up in an intensely musical home. In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at Saint Petersburg University while taking private lessons in harmony and counterpoint. Stravinsky worked under the guidance of Rimsky-Korsakov, having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts. By the time of his mentor's death in 1908 Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a Piano Sonata in F♯ minor (1903–04), a Symphony in E♭ major (1907), which he catalogued as \\"Opus 1\\", and a short orchestral piece, Feu d'artifice (\\"Fireworks\\", composed in 1908).In 1909 Feu d'artifice was performed at a concert in St. Petersburg. Among those in the audience was the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who at that time was planning to introduce Russian music and art to western audiences. Like Stravinsky, Diaghilev had initially studied law, but had gravitated via journalism into the theatrical world. In 1907 he began his theatrical career by presenting five concerts in Paris; in the following year he introduced Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov. In 1909, still in Paris, he launched the Ballets Russes, initially with Borodin's Polovtsian Dances from Prince Igor and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade. To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer Michel Fokine, the designer Léon Bakst and the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky. Diaghilev's intention, however, was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th-century style, and he was looking for fresh compositional talent. Having heard Feu d'artifice he approached Stravinsky, initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by Chopin to create the ballet Les Sylphides.

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.

Another touchdown pass from Manning to Demaryius Thomas &#8212; from 14 yards out &#8212; narrowed the Dolphins' lead to 21-17 just before halftime. The Broncos drove to as far as the Dolphins' 7-yard line on the initial possession of the second half, but after Manning was sacked by Dolphins' linebacker Jelani Jenkins for an 8-yard loss, McManus missed on a 33-yard field goal attempt.

Objectives: To determine whether rs6967330 influences RV-C infections and illnesses in early childhood. Methods: We studied associations between rs6967330 and respiratory infections and illnesses in the COPSAC 2010 (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010) and COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma Birth Cohort Study) birth cohorts, where respiratory infections were monitored prospectively for the first 3 years of life. Nasal samples were collected during acute infections in both cohorts and during asymptomatic periods in COAST and analyzed for RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C, and other common respiratory viruses. Measurements and Main Results: The CDHR3 asthma risk allele (rs6967330-A) was associated with increased risk of respiratory tract illnesses (incidence risk ratio [IRR] = 1.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.23]; P = 0.003). In particular, this variant was associated with risk of respiratory episodes with detection of RV-C in COPSAC 2010 (IRR = 1.89 [1.14-3.05]; P = 0.01) and in COAST (IRR = 1.37 [1.02-1.82]; P = 0.03) children, and in a combined meta-analysis (IRR = 1.51 [1.13-2.02]; P = 0.006). In contrast, the variant was not associated with illnesses related to other viruses (IRR = 1.07 [0.92-1.25]; P = 0.37). Consistent with these observations, the CDHR3 variant was associated with increased detection of RV-C, but not of other viruses during scheduled visits at specific ages. Conclusions: The CDHR3 asthma risk allele is associated specifically with RV-C illnesses in two birth cohorts. This clinical evidence supports earlier molecular evidence indicating that CDHR3 functions as an RV-C receptor, and raises the possibility of preventing RV-C infections by targeting CDHR3. \\n Title: Cadherin-related Family Member 3 Genetics and Rhinovirus C Respiratory Illnesses","target":"False","rationale":"The research aims to investigate the role of CDHR3 gene and its variant rs6967330 in rhinovirus C infections and illnesses in early childhood, so it's a study focusing on clinical evidence.

In response to CDC reports, Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL) launched an investigation of patients being tested for enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) in Ontario, Canada. The purpose of this investigation was to enhance our understanding of EV-D68 epidemiology and clinical features. Data for this study included specimens submitted for EV-D68 testing at PHOL from September 1, 2014 to October 31, 2014. Comparisons were made between patients who tested positive for the virus (cases) and those testing negative (controls). EV-D68 was identified in 153/907 (16.8%) of patients tested. In the logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, setting and time to specimen collection, individuals younger than 20 years of age were more likely to be diagnosed with EV-D68 compared to those 20 and over, with peak positivity at ages 5-9 years. Cases were not more likely to be hospitalized than controls. Cases were more likely to be identified in September than October (OR 8.07; 95% CI 5.15 to 12.64). Routine viral culture and multiplex PCR were inadequate methods to identify EV-D68 due to poor sensitivity and inability to differentiate EV-D68 from other enterovirus serotypes or rhinovirus. Testing for EV-D68 in Ontario from July to December, 2014 detected the presence of EV-D68 virus among young children during September-October, 2014, with most cases detected in September. There was no difference in hospitalization status between cases and controls. In order to better understand the epidemiology of this virus, surveillance for EV-D68 should include testing of symptomatic individuals from all treatment settings and patient age groups, with collection and analysis of comprehensive clinical and epidemiological data.","target":"Epidemiology of Enterovirus D68 in Ontario","rationale":"The title should summarize the epidemiology of EV-D68 in Ontario.

Smith, who often cheered for the \\"heel\\" wrestlers, had been heckling Sullivan (then a \\"babyface\\") throughout the night causing the wrestler to believe that Smith was responsible. The young wrestling fan was brought to the dressing room by building security after the match where he was confronted by Sullivan, Gorilla Monsoon and Arnold Skaaland. Smith denied any wrongdoing and was allowed to leave. Smith continued watching wrestling after moving to Knoxville, Tennessee in the mid-1970s. He eventually met Norvell Austin at a Southeastern Championship Wrestling. Austin later introduced Smith to Rick Conner who agreed to train him.\\n Links: a. Knoxville, Tennessee b. WWE c.

So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had.

This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea.\\nFor one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs.\\nI wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom.

Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Since the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968.\\n\\nTo avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve \\"poofs\\" and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972.  In 1973, he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF's behalf. His actions triggered opposition within and between different groups of national delegates including the Communist Party of Great Britain and National Union of Students. He was banned from conferences, had his leaflets confiscated and burned, was interrogated by the secret police (the Stasi) and threatened and assaulted by other delegates, mostly communists.  Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West.  Describing his time in the Gay Liberation Front, he wrote in The Guardian that:  [The] GLF was a glorious, enthusiastic and often chaotic mix of anarchists, hippies, leftwingers, feminists, liberals and counter-culturalists. Despite our differences, we shared a radical idealism - a dream of what the world could and should be - free from not just homophobia but the whole sex-shame culture, which oppressed straights as much as LGBTs. We were sexual liberationists and social revolutionaries, out to turn the world upside down. [...] GLF's main aim was never equality within the status quo. [...] GLF's strategy for queer emancipation was to change society's values and norms, rather than adapt to them. We sought a cultural revolution to overturn centuries of male heterosexual domination and thereby free both queers and women. [...] Forty years on, GLF's gender agenda has been partly won. [...] Girlish boys and boyish girls don't get victimised as much as in times past. LGBT kids often now come out at the age of 12 or 14. While many are bullied, many others are not.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\\n\\nTo celebrate my retirement earlier this year, my husband and I went on a cruise to Alaska.

Maximal binding capacity was measured by in vivo saturation analysis. Nuclear receptor occupancy at endogenous levels of T3 and T4 in euthyroid rats was estimated from the equilibrium nuclear to serum ratio of tracer T3, and the locally generated nuclear T3 to serum T4 ratio after injecting tracer T3 and T4. These ratios were multiplied, respectively, by the endogenous concentrations of T3 and T4 as measured by RIA. The maximal binding capacity was 0.65 ng T3/mg DNA, and saturation was 71%. Fifty-five percent of the nuclear T3 was generated locally, and 45% was derived from circulating T3. BAT is, hence, comparable to the liver in number of receptors (approximately 5000/cell) and to the pituitary with regard to saturation and relative contributions of locally generated T3 and plasma T3 to nuclear T3. These results suggest that BAT may be an important target for thyroid hormones and, along with other data, that alterations in the activity of the type II 5'-deiodinase of this tissue may influence the saturation of nuclear T3 receptors.","target":"Animal","rationale":"The abstract discusses the results of a study in which researchers measured the sources of T3 (triiodothyronine) associated with high affinity, low capacity cellular nuclear receptors in brown adipose tissue (BAT) by administering radioactive tracer material to euthyroid rats and measuring the binding capacity and saturation of nuclear receptors.

Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money....\\nthe author thinks that hiring 1000 designers\\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\\n- will radically change the company\\n- will not change the company at all.\\n- isn't going to have much of an impact\\n- not enough information","target":"isn't going to have much of an impact","rationale":"The author argues that hiring 1000 designers into an organization of over 370,000 people is not going to have much impact. This can be inferred from the fact that even if these thousand new hires were all trained in design thinking and helped implement it within their teams or projects, this still only accounts for a small percentage of IBM's overall headcount.\\nSo, isn't going to have much of an impact is the correct answer choice."},{"source":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -31*g + 33*g + 4 = 0 for g.","target":"-2","rationale":"To solve for g, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.\\n\\nStarting with: -31*g + 33*g + 4 = 0\\nSubtract 31*g from both sides: 2 *33*g+4=0\\nSimplifying further by subtracting 4 from each side:2 *33*g=-4  Divide all terms in the left-hand side by 2 and you get 867/5_EQUALS_-2"},{"source":"You are given a mathematical question described with a circumscribed mathematical vocabulary.

My fiance and I went through some rough patches a little while ago, and my frustration levels were high. He has this problem with not thinking about how another person could interpret his words, so sometimes he'll say something REALLY offensive and genuinely not mean it that way. I've learned to let a lot of it go, and to try and see what he really meant instead of just jumping to the \\"he's an asshole\\" conclusion, but there are a few things he's said that have stuck in my mind, and make me angry just to think about. \\n\\nThe biggest one is when he said \\"It's just human nature to cheat!\\" while we were arguing about why he wouldn't take a job that kept him out of the house. He went on to tell me that he didn't trust \\"human nature\\" and thought I would sleep with our mutual roommate (also male) if we were left alone for too long. That one really burns me up. Not only is it SUPER fucking rude and insulting, it's super hypocritical! Our roommate would leave his then-girlfriend at our apartment while I also went to work, leaving my fiance and the girlfriend alone for up to 10 hours a day. He also has cheated on his previous girlfriends, but he was 15 and we're all terrible people at 15.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.\\n\\nParagraph: Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening.

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.","target":"Western","rationale":"The question states that the Eastern land is wetland, which means it has flooded soil.

A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.

Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and something of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.In Agrippina the da capo aria is the musical form used to illustrate character in the context of the opera. The first four arias of the work exemplify this: Nero's \\"Con raggio\\", in a minor key and with a descending figure on the key phrase \\"il trono ascenderò\\" (\\"I will ascend the throne\\") characterises him as weak and irresolute. Pallas's first aria \\"La mia sorte fortunata\\", with its \\"wide-leaping melodic phrasing\\" introduces him as a bold, heroic figure, contrasting with his rival Narcissus whose introspective nature is displayed in his delicate aria \\"Volo pronto\\" which immediately follows. Agrippina's introductory aria \\"L'alma mia\\" has a mock-military form which reflects her outward power, while subtle musical phrasing establishes her real emotional state.

Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.\\n\\nWhich gardener had a soil that takes longer to dry in spring?\\n\\nHint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.","target":"Joe","rationale":"Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.

He first suggests that greater priority should be given to sexual arousal and attraction over behaviour and identity because it is less prone to self- and other-deception, social conditions and variable meanings. To measure attraction and arousal he proposed that biological measures should be developed and used. There are numerous biological/physiological measures that exist that can measure sexual orientation such as sexual arousal, brain scans, eye tracking, body odour preference, and anatomical variations such as digit-length ratio and right or left handedness. Secondly, Savin-Williams suggests that researchers should forsake the general notion of sexual orientation altogether and assess only those components that are relevant for the research question being investigated.

However, few studies have focussed on the distribution of body mass index (BMI) in celiac populations and its relationship to clinical characteristics, or on its response to treatment.\\n METHODS:We reviewed BMI measurements and other clinical and pathological characteristics from a database of 371 celiac patients diagnosed over a 10-yr period and seen by a single gastroenterologist. To assess response to gluten exclusion, we compared BMI at diagnosis and after 2 yr treatment in patients with serological support for dietary compliance.\\n RESULTS:Mean BMI was 24.6 kg/m2 (range 16.3–43.5). Seventeen patients (5%) were underweight (BMI <18.5), 211 (57%) were normal, and 143 (39%) were overweight (BMI ≥25), including 48 (13% of all patients) in the obese range (BMI ≥30.0). There was a significant association between low BMI and female gender, history of diarrhea, reduced hemoglobin concentration, reduced bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis, and higher grades (subtotal/total) of villous atrophy. Of patients compliant with a gluten-free diet, 81% had gained weight after 2 yr, including 82% of initially overweight patients.\\n CONCLUSIONS:Few celiac patients are underweight at diagnosis and a large minority is overweight; these are less likely to present with classical features of diarrhea and reduced hemoglobin. Failed or delayed diagnosis of celiac disease may reflect lack of awareness of this large subgroup. The increase in weight of already overweight patients after dietary gluten exclusion is a potential cause of morbidity, and the gluten-free diet as conventionally prescribed needs to be modified accordingly..

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.\\n\\n- Akim Mikhailovich Tamiroff (; birth name\` Hovakim, ; 29 October 1899  17 September 1972) was an ethnic Armenian actor.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.\\n\\nParagraph: Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well.

Weber's law predicts the delta R50 (the added load detectable on 50% of presentations) to be a fixed percent of the background resistance (R0) and thus the delta R50/R0 ratio (the Weber fraction) is constant. We have noted the nose to be sensitive to added load, we wondered if the nose might play a role in RLD. To determine whether this was true and to characterize the effects of changes in R0 in the range of normal nasal resistance (RN), we determined R0 and delta R50 using standard techniques under the following conditions: nose vs. decongested nose, nose vs. nose with added external R0 (3.0 and 8.0 cmH2O X l-1 X s), nose vs. anesthetized nose, nose vs. mouth, and mouth vs. mouth with added load (3 cmH2O X l-1 X s). We found that decongestant decreased RN [4.3 +/- 0.6 (SE) to 3.1 +/- 0.5 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05] and delta R50 (1.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05). When an external load of 3 cmH2O X l-1 X s was added to the nose, delta R50 did not change significantly (1.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s), but the Weber fraction decreased (0.28 +/- 0.05 to 0.15 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","target":"Role of the nose in resistive load detection","rationale":"The abstract describes the effects of changes in R0 (resistance) and delta R50 on nasal resistance, which is measured under different conditions.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.\\nFrom the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.\\n\\n- The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.\\n\\n- The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.\\n\\n- Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces, police, intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex.\\n\\n- A field officer, field grade officer, or senior officer is an army, marine, or air force commissioned officer senior in rank to a company officer but junior to a general officer. In most armies this corresponds to the ranks of major, lieutenant colonel and colonel, or their equivalents. Some countries also include brigadier in the definition.\\n\\n- The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.\\n\\n- The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large.\\n\\n- Major is a military rank of commissioned officer status, with corresponding ranks existing in many military forces throughout the world. When used unhyphenated, in conjunction with no other indicators, Major is one rank senior to that of an army Captain, and one rank subordinate or below the rank of Lieutenant colonel. It is considered the most junior of the field officer ranks.\\n\\n- Thomas Buchanan McGuire , Jr. ( August 1 , 1920 -- January 7 , 1945 ) was a United States Army major who was killed in action while serving as a member of the Army Air Forces during World War II and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . He was one of the most decorated American fighter pilots and the second highest scoring American ace of the war . McGuire was memorialized by the renaming of Fort Dix Army Air Force Base in Burlington County , New Jersey , to McGuire Air Force Base in 1948 .\\n\\n- The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790.\\n\\n- An army (from Latin \\"arma\\" \\"arms, weapons\\" via Old French \\"armée\\", \\"armed\\" (feminine)) or ground force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include other branches of the military such as the air force via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. They differ from army reserves who are activated only during such times as war or natural disasters.\\n\\n- The Army of the United States or Armies of the United States is the legal name of the \\"land forces of the United States\\" (United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001) and has been used in this context since at least 1841, as in the title: \\"General Regulations for the Army of the United States\\". The Army, or Armies of the United States includes: the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve, (as well as any volunteer or conscripted forces). \\n\\n- The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.\\n\\n- A fighter pilot is a military aviator trained to engage in air-to-air combat while in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft.

He was the Republican Party nominee for Vice President of the United States, running alongside former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Ryan also has been the U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district since 1999. He was previously chair of the House Ways and Means Committee from January 3 to October 29, 2015, and, before that, chair of the House Budget Committee from 2011 to 2015.\\nContext: Paul Davis Ryan Jr. was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, the youngest of four children of Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Ann (nee Hutter), who later became an interior designer, and Paul Davis Ryan, a lawyer. He is a fifth-generation Wisconsinite. His father was of Irish ancestry and his mother of German and English ancestry. One of Ryan's paternal ancestors settled in Wisconsin prior to the Civil War. His great-grandfather, Patrick William Ryan (1858-1917), founded an earthmoving company in 1884, which later became P. W. Ryan and Sons and is now known as Ryan Incorporated Central. Ryan's grandfather, Stanley M. Ryan (1898-1957), was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin.  Ryan attended St. Mary's Catholic School in Janesville, where he played on the seventh-grade basketball team, then attended Joseph A. Craig High School, where he was elected president of his junior class, and thus became prom king. As class president Ryan was a representative of the student body on the school board. Following his second year, Ryan took a job working the grill at McDonald's. He was on his high school's ski, track, and varsity soccer teams and played basketball in a Catholic recreational league. He participated in several academic and social clubs including the Model United Nations. Ryan and his family often went on hiking and skiing trips to the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  When he was 16, Ryan found his 55-year-old father lying dead in bed of a heart attack. Following the death of his father, Ryan's grandmother moved in with the family. As she had Alzheimer's, Ryan helped care for her while his mother commuted to college in Madison, Wisconsin. From the time of his father's death until his 18th birthday, Ryan received Social Security survivors benefits, which were saved for his college education. His mother remarried, to Bruce Douglas.  Ryan has a bachelor's degree in economics and political science from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he became interested in the writings of Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Milton Friedman. He often visited the office of libertarian professor Richard Hart to discuss the theories of these economists and of Ayn Rand. Hart introduced Ryan to National Review, and with Hart's recommendation Ryan began an internship in the D.C. office of Wisconsin U.S. Senator Bob Kasten where he worked with Kasten's foreign affairs adviser.  He attended the Washington Semester program at American University. Ryan worked summers as a salesman for Oscar Mayer and once got to drive the Wienermobile. Ryan was a member of the College Republicans, and volunteered for the congressional campaign of John Boehner.

My father attended college, but had to drop out cause no one could afford his tuition even though it was $1200 a year and it was a community college. A lot of the kids that go to my school have parents that are lawyers, government workers, or military so I feel like they judge me when I tell them my parents’ occupations. \\n\\nMy family definitely isn’t poor now, but we definitely can’t afford to buy airpods, IPhone XR’s, and expensive sneakers like the other kids. I’m okay with that cause I like the concept of minimalism and I like the konmari method of living. I’d like to think I’m mature for my age but I sound cocky. Sometimes the other girls will tease me lightheartedly cause I don’y have airpods or cause my phone has a headphone jack. (I have an IPhone 6)\\n\\nAnyways, to make ends meet and afford non-necessities, my dad goes around to all the Home Depots in the area, buys the stuff that is on clearance (sometimes it’ll be stuff like a panini press or sink faucets for 1 cent) and he’ll resell them on Craigslist. \\n\\nI get annoyed because he’ll resell the items at the grocery store parking lot next to my school, and I’m embarrassed that everyone sees my dad doing “shady” business. The girls at my school are pretty judgemental and always talk about people behind their back. \\n\\nToday I went to a basketball game, and right afterwards my dad sold something right in the parking lot of the school while my friends were entering their cars. I’ve talked to him about how it embarrasses me, but he just doesn’t seem to listen. I started yelling at him cause I was embarrassed that my teammates would judge me or mock me behind my back. Or maybe spread rumors about me. \\n\\nI got into a pretty big fight with my dad and told him about how he embarrasses me. He also has a pretty big smoking habit, and none of the other girls’ parents smoke cigarettes.  I’ve had a girl come over to my house and mention my dad’s smoking habit with disgust since we had an empty coke bottle outside that my dad threw away his cigarettes in. Ever since then, I’ve been paranoid about having people over to the house. \\n\\nHe also works the night shift so that he can pick me up from school, so he’s always sleeping in the living room after we go home. I never have people come over after school either cause they don’t understand.

CR1 on neutrophils bearing monovalent anti-CR1 was not attached to the cytoskeleton. In contrast, cross-linked CR1 on erythrocytes and cross-linked MHC Class I on neutrophils were not cytoskeleton associated. A possible role for filamentous actin (F-actin) in the binding of cross-linked CR1 to neutrophil cytoskeleton was suggested by three observations. When neutrophils were differentially extracted with either Low Salt-detergent buffer or High Salt-detergent buffer, stained with FITC-phalloidin, and examined by fluorescent flow cytometry, the residual cytoskeletons generated with the former buffer were shown to contain polymerized F-actin, whereas cytoskeletons generated with the latter buffer were found to be depleted of F-actin. In parallel experiments, High Salt-detergent buffer was also found to release cross-linked CR1 from neutrophils. Second, depolymerization of F-actin by DNAse I released half of the cytoskeletal-associated cross-linked CR1. Third, immunoadsorbed neutrophil CR1, but not MHC Class I or erythrocyte CR1, specifically bound soluble 125I-actin. In addition, Fc receptor and CR3, other phagocytic membrane proteins of neutrophils, specifically bound 125I-actin. These data demonstrate that CR1 cross-linked on neutrophils becomes associated with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton and that this interaction is mediated either directly or indirectly by actin. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Differential interaction of the C3b/C4b receptor and MHC class I with the cytoskeleton of human neutrophils. option2: The kingdoms of organisms [letter]","target":"Differential interaction of the C3b/C4b receptor and MHC class I with the cytoskeleton of human neutrophils","rationale":"The abstract states that the C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) becomes attached to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton of human neutrophils when receptors are cross-linked by affinity-purified polyclonal F(ab')2 anti-CR1, dimeric C3b, or Fab monoclonal anti-CR1 followed by F(ab')2 goat anti-mouse F(ab')2.

Brown was the fourth of five children. During Brown's childhood, mob violence periodically erupted in Mineola, keeping African- Americans from voting. His first job was a shoeshine boy in a whites-only barber shop.\\nContext: One of Brown's central campaign promises was his \\"100-Day Plan for Muni,\\" in which he boasted he would fix the city's municipal bus system in that many days. Brown supported the \\"Peer Pressure\\" Bus Patrol program, which paid former gang members and troubled youth to patrol Muni buses. Brown claimed the program helped reduce crime. He fired Muni chief Phil Adams and replaced him with his chief of staff Emilio Cruz. In 1998, Brown was Mayor during the summer of the Muni meltdown as Muni implemented the new ATC system and Brown promised riders there would be better times ahead. A voter approved initiative in the following year would help improve Muni services. Brown increased Muni's budget by tens of millions of dollars over his tenure. Brown later said he made a mistake in over promising with his 100-Day Plan.  Brown helped mediate a settlement to the 1997 BART strike.  During his first term as mayor, Brown quietly favored the demolition and abolition of the Transbay Terminal to accommodate the redevelopment of the site for market-rate housing. Centrally located at First and Mission Streets near the Financial District and South Beach, the terminal originally served as the San Francisco terminus for the electric commuter trains of the East Bay Electric Lines, the Key System of streetcars and the Sacramento Northern railroads which ran on the lower deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Following the termination of streetcar service in 1958, the terminal has seen continuous service as a major bus facility for East Bay commuters; AC Transit buses transport riders from the terminal directly into neighborhoods throughout the inner East Bay. The terminal also serves passengers traveling to San Mateo County and the North Bay aboard SamTrans and Golden Gate Transit buses respectively, and to tourists arriving by bus motorcoach. Today, the terminal is being planned for redevelopment as a region wide mass transit hub maintaining the current bus services, but with a new tunnel that would extend the Caltrain commuter rail line from its current terminus at Fourth and Townsend Streets to the site. Once completed, Caltrain riders would no longer need to transfer to Muni in order to reach the downtown financial district. Additionally, the heavy rail portion of the terminal would be designed to accommodate the planned High Speed Rail lines to Los Angeles.  In 1998, The Berkeley, California-based Bicycle Civil Liberties Union, produced a two-hour documentary film in the muckraker journalism tradition, July 25: The Secret is Out, which gives evidence of Brown's designs for the Transbay Terminal site.\\nQuestion: Were there any budget changes?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Brown increased Muni's budget by tens of millions of dollars over his tenure.","rationale":"The context states Brown increased Muni's budget by tens of millions of dollars over his tenure.\\nWhich is why the answer extracted from the context is \\"Brown increased Muni's budget by tens of millions of dollars over his tenure.\\""},{"source":"Sentence: One wants to decorate their child's room with Star Wars gear. one should make a light saber cooking utensil.\\nIf the sentence does not make sense, correct it so that it does make sense.

Therefore, I would suggest \\"Phylogenetic analysis of Portuguese Feline Immunodeficiency Virus sequences reveals high genetic diversity\\" as an appropriate title for this paper."},{"source":"You are given a dialog between 2 or more individuals.

Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.\\n\\n- An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.\\n\\n- Sognsvann (or \\"Sognsvannet\\") is a 3.3 km circumference lake just north of Oslo, Norway.\\n\\n- Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain.

It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals.\\n\\n- The Oslo Metro (or or simply ) is the rapid transit system of Oslo, Norway, operated by Sporveien T-banen on contract from the transit authority Ruter. The network consists of five lines that all run through the city centre, with a total length of , serving 101 stations of which 17 are underground or indoors. In addition to serving 14 out of the 15 boroughs of Oslo (all except St. Hanshaugen), two lines run to Bærum. In 2015, the system had an annual ridership of 94.4 million.\\n\\n- Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938).\\n\\n- A campus is traditionally the land on which a college or university and related institutional buildings are situated. Usually a college campus includes libraries, lecture halls, residence halls, student centers or dining halls, and park-like settings.\\n\\n- Rapid transit, also known as heavy rail, metro, subway, tube, or underground, is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas. Unlike buses or trams, rapid transit systems are electric railways that operate on an exclusive right-of-way, which cannot be accessed by pedestrians or other vehicles of any sort, and which is often grade separated in tunnels or on elevated railways.\\n\\n- Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot.\\n\\n- St. Hanshaugen (Norwegian for St. John's Hill) is a district of the city of Oslo, Norway.\\n\\n- A tram (also known as tramcar; and in North America known as streetcar, trolley or trolley car) is a rail vehicle which runs on tracks along public urban streets, and also sometimes on a segregated right of way. The lines or networks operated by tramcars are called tramways. Tramways powered by electricity, the most common type historically, were once called electric street railways (mainly in the USA). However, trams were widely used in urban areas before the universal adoption of electrification; other methods of powering trams are listed below under \\"History\\".\\n\\n- Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.\\n\\n- Oslo is the capital and the most populous city in Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838. Following a spelling reform, it was known as Kristiania from 1877 to 1925, at which time its original Norwegian name was restored.\\n\\n- Sporveien T-banen AS is a limited company that is responsible for operating Oslo Metro, the rapid transit in Oslo, Norway. The company is owned by Sporveien, which is owned by the city council. Sporveien operates on a contract with Ruter, the public transport administration in Oslo and Akershus.\\n\\n- Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.\\n\\n- Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.\\n\\n- Christian IV (12 April 1577  28 February 1648), sometimes colloquially referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway, was king of Denmark-Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 to 1648. His 59-year reign is the longest of Danish monarchs, and of Scandinavian monarchies.\\n\\n- Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.\\n\\n- Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).\\n\\n- Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.\\n\\n- The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.\\n\\n- History.\\nThe introduction of self-government in rural districts was a major political change. The Norwegian farm culture (\\"bondekultur\\") that emerged came to serve as a symbol of nationalistic resistance to the forced union with Sweden. The legislation of 1837 gave both the towns and the rural areas the same institutions: a minor change for the town, but a major advance for the rural communities. The significance of this legislation is hailed by a nationalistic historian, Ernst Sars:\\n\\n- Vestgrensa ( originally Ullevål Haveby ) was a light rail station on the Sognsvann Line of the Oslo Metro in Norway . It opened on 10 October 1934 , and was located between Blindern and Ullevål stadion stations . The station was rebuilt when the Sognsvann Line was upgraded from light rail to metro standard in the early 1990s . It was closed on 22 August 1999 , when it was replaced by the new station Forskningsparken .\\n\\n- A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.\\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...\\n\\n- A personal union is the combination of two or more states that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. It differs from a federation in that each constituent state has an independent government, whereas a unitary state is united by a central government. The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.\\n\\n- The Common Tunnel, sometimes called the Common Line, is a long tunnel of the Oslo Metro which runs through the city center of Oslo, Norway. The name derives from the fact that all six lines of the metro use the tunnel, which runs from Majorstuen to Tøyen. The section has six stations, including the four busiest on the metro.\\n\\n- Akershus is a county in Norway, bordering Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud, Oslo, and Østfold; it also has a short border with Sweden (Värmland). Akershus, with more than half a million inhabitants, is the second-largest county by population after Oslo. The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The county administration is in Oslo, which is not part of the county \\"per se\\".\\n\\n- Jämtland (Norwegian: \\"Jemtland\\"; Latin: \\"Iemptia\\") or Jamtland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in the center of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders to Härjedalen and Medelpad in the south, Ångermanland in the east, Lapland in the north and Trøndelag and Norway in the west. Jämtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden's total area and is the second largest province in Sweden. It has a population of 112,717, the majority of whom live in \\"Storsjöbygden\\", the area surrounding lake Storsjön. Östersund is Jämtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden.\\n\\n- Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.\\n\\n- Ruter AS is the public transport authority for Oslo and Akershus counties in Norway. Formally a limited company  60% of the shares in which are owned by the Oslo county municipality and 40% by that of Akershus  it is responsible for administrating, funding, and marketing (but not operating) public transport in the two counties, including buses, the Oslo Metro (\\"T-banen i Oslo\\"), Oslo Trams (\\"Trikken i Oslo\\"), and ferry services. Ruter also holds agreements with the Norwegian State Railways concerning the regulation of fares on commuter train services operated within the two counties.\\n\\n- Bærum is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Sandvika. Bærum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838. A suburb of Oslo, Bærum is located on the west coast of the city.\\n\\n- Blindern is the main campus of the University of Oslo, located in Nordre Aker in Oslo, Norway.\\n\\n- Headway is a measurement of the minimum possible distance or time between vehicles in a transit system, without a reduction in the speed of vehicles. The precise definition varies depending on the application, but it is most commonly measured as the distance from the tip of one vehicle to the tip of the next one behind it, expressed as the time it will take for the trailing vehicle to cover that distance. A \\"shorter\\" headway signifies a more frequent service. Freight trains might have headways measured in parts of an hour, metro systems operate with headways on the order of 1 to 5 minutes, and vehicles on a freeway can have as little as 2 seconds headway between them.\\n\\n- Härjedalen is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" in the centre of Sweden. It borders the country of Norway as well as the provinces of Dalarna, Hälsingland, Medelpad, and Jämtland. The province originally belonged to Norway, but was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Brömsebro, 1645.\\n\\n- Haakon V Magnusson (10 April 1270 - 8 May 1319) (Old Norse: \\"Hákon Magnússon\\"; Norwegian: \\"Håkon Magnusson\\") was king of Norway from 1299 until 1319.\\n\\n- Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north.\\n\\n- Harald Sigurdsson (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Sigurðarson\\"; c. 1015  25 September 1066), given the epithet Hardrada (\\"harðráði\\", roughly translated as \\"stern counsel\\" or \\"hard ruler\\") in the sagas, was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066. In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Prior to becoming king, Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire.\\n\\n- The University of Oslo, until 1939 named the Royal Frederick University, is the oldest university in Norway, located in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. Until 1 January 2016 it was the largest Norwegian institution of higher education in terms of size, now surpassed only by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The Academic Ranking of World Universities has ranked it the 58th best university in the world and the third best in the Nordic countries. In 2015, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked it the 135th best university in the world and the seventh best in the Nordics. While in its 2016, Top 200 Rankings of European universities, the Times Higher Education listed the University of Oslo at 63rd, making it the highest ranked Norwegian university. \\n\\n- The Sognsvann Line is a rapid transit line on the Oslo Metro of Norway. It branches from the Common Tunnel at Majorstuen and runs to Sognsvann. After Ullevål stadion, the Ring Line branches off. The Sognsvann Line serves the northwestern and northern neighborhoods of Oslo, mostly within the borough of Nordre Aker. The line is owned and maintained by Kollektivtransportproduksjon and has nine stations. The western end of line 5 serves the entire line. Line 4 and the eastern end of line 5 serve the southern part of the line up to Ullevål stadion before branching off and continuing along the Ring Line. This gives an average five-minute headway on the southern part and an average fifteen-minute headway on the northern part of the line.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'vestgrensa ' and 'nordre aker'?","target":"located in the administrative territorial entity","rationale":"The answer is 'located in the administrative territorial entity'."},{"source":"The Appalachian Mountains (i/ˌæpəˈleɪʃᵻn/ or /ˌæpəˈlætʃᵻn/,[note 1] French: les Appalaches), often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America.

The archipelago represents the remnants of a long-extinct ring volcano rising from a seabed plateau approximately 40 metres (130 ft) below sea level.At 670 hectares (1,700 acres) in extent, Hirta is the largest island in the group and comprises more than 78% of the land area of the archipelago. Next in size are Soay (English: \\"sheep island\\") at 99 hectares (240 acres) and Boreray ('the fortified isle'), which measures 86 hectares (210 acres). Soay is 0.5 kilometres (0.31 mi) north-west of Hirta, Boreray 6 kilometres (4 mi) to the northeast. Smaller islets and stacks in the group include Stac an Armin ('warrior's stack'), Stac Lee ('grey stack') and Stac Levenish ('stream' or 'torrent'). The island of Dùn ('fort'), which protects Village Bay from the prevailing southwesterly winds, was at one time joined to Hirta by a natural arch. MacLean (1972) suggests that the arch was broken when struck by a galleon fleeing the defeat of the Spanish Armada, but other sources, such as Mitchell (1992) and Fleming (2005), suggest that the arch was simply swept away by one of the many fierce storms that batter the islands every winter.\\nThe highest point in the archipelago, Conachair ('the beacon') at 430 metres (1,410 ft), is on Hirta, immediately north of the village.

With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star.

Zizka is held to be one of the most renowned military leaders by many historians and today he is widely considered a Czech national hero. He was born in the small village of Trocnov (now part of Borovany) in the Kingdom of Bohemia into an aristocratic family.\\nContext: Early in 1423, internal dissent among the Hussites led to civil war. Zizka, as leader of the Taborites, defeated the men of Prague and the Utraquist nobles at Horice on April 20. Shortly afterwards came news that a new crusade against Bohemia was being prepared. This induced the Hussites to conclude an armistice at Konopiste on June 24. As soon as the crusaders had dispersed, internal dissent broke out anew. During his temporary rule over Bohemia, Prince Sigismund Korybut of Lithuania had appointed Borek, the lord of Miletinek, governor of the city of Hradec Kralove. Borek belonged to a moderate Hussite faction, the Utraquist party. After the departure of Sigismund Korybut, the city of Hradec Kralove refused to recognize Borek as its ruler, due to the democratic party gaining the upper hand. They called Zizka to its aid. He acceded to the demand and defeated the Utraquists under Borek at the farm of Strachov, near the city of Hradec Kralove on August 4, 1423.  Zizka now attempted to invade Hungary, which was under the rule of his old enemy King Sigismund. Though this Hungarian campaign was unsuccessful owing to the great superiority of the Hungarians, it ranks among the greatest military exploits of Zizka, on account of the skill he displayed in retreat. In 1424, civil war having again broken out in Bohemia, Zizka decisively defeated the \\"Praguers\\" and Utraquist nobles at Skalice on January 6, and at Malesov on June 7. In September, he marched on Prague. On the 14th of that month, peace was concluded between the Hussite parties through the influence of John of Rokycany, afterwards Utraquist archbishop of Prague. It was agreed that the now reunited Hussites should attack Moravia, part of which was still held by Sigismund's partisans, and that Zizka should be the leader in this campaign. However, he died of the plague at Pribyslav on October 11, 1424 on the Moravian frontier. According to chronicler Piccolomini, Zizka's dying wish was to have his skin used to make drums so that he might continue to lead his troops even after death. Zizka was so well regarded that when he died, his soldiers called themselves the Orphans (sirotci) because they felt like they had lost their father. His enemies said that \\"The one whom no mortal hand could destroy was extinguished by the finger of God.\\"  He was succeeded by Prokop the Great.\\nQuestion: What happened to Zizka then?.

Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris.\\nWhen Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.","target":"Molly","rationale":"Nearsightedness (myopia) is the inability to clearly see distant objects.

April 2] 1743 - July 4, 1826) was an American Founding Father who was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and later served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Previously, he was elected the second Vice President of the United States, serving under John Adams from 1797 to 1801. A proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights motivating American colonists to break from Great Britain and form a new nation, he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level.\\n\\nAt the start of the Revolution, Jefferson was a Colonel and was named commander of the Albemarle County Militia on September 26, 1775. He was then elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776, when finalizing a state constitution was a priority. For nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which forbade state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine. The bill failed to pass, as did his legislation to disestablish the Anglican church, but both were later revived by James Madison.  In 1778, Jefferson was given the task of revising the state's laws. He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to streamline the judicial system. Jefferson's proposed statutes provided for general education, which he considered the basis of \\"republican government\\". He had become alarmed that Virginia's powerful landed gentry were becoming a hereditary aristocracy. He took the lead in abolishing what he called \\"feudal and unnatural distinctions.\\" He targeted laws such as entail and primogeniture by which the oldest son inherited all the land. The entail laws made it perpetual: the one who inherited the land could not sell it, but had to bequeath it to his oldest son. As a result, increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by black slaves, gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern (\\"Tidewater\\") tobacco areas. During the Revolutionary era, all such laws were repealed by the states that had them.  Jefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780. He transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond, and introduced measures for public education, religious freedom, and revision of inheritance laws.  During General Benedict Arnold's 1781 invasion of Virginia, Jefferson escaped Richmond just ahead of the British forces, and the city was burned to the ground. General Charles Cornwallis that spring dispatched a cavalry force led by Banastre Tarleton to capture Jefferson and members of the Assembly at Monticello, but Jack Jouett of the Virginia militia thwarted the British plan. Jefferson escaped to Poplar Forest, his plantation to the west. When the General Assembly reconvened in June 1781, it conducted an inquiry into Jefferson's actions which eventually concluded that Jefferson had acted with honor--but he was not re-elected.  In April of the same year, his daughter Lucy died at age one. A second daughter of that name was born the following year, but she died at age three.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: When he became governor?","target":"Jefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.","rationale":"The correct answer is: Jefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.\\n\\nFrom the context of this article, it is clear that Thomas Jefferson became Governor twice - once in 1779 and again in 1780.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both.

Cook came within about 120 km (75 mi) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773. The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals. According to various organizations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, and other sources), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820: von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut). The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km (20 mi) from Queen Maud's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S 2°14′50″W\uFEFF / \uFEFF69.35778°S 2.24722°W\uFEFF / -69.35778; -2.24722, which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820.

Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings have gone up in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, Uptown had more than 23 million square feet (2,100,000 m²) of office space with 16 million square feet (1,500,000 m²) of Class A office space.\\nTopic from the passage:","target":"Houston","rationale":"The topic of this passage is Houston.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.","target":"No","rationale":"The text talks about the Sui dynasty in China.

For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier.

This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage.\\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations.

Moisture also remains trapped within dead organic material such as fallen leaves, branches etc., preventing it from evaporating into the atmosphere quickly when compared to open spaces without dense coverings like forests and woodlots provide. As a result, soils in heavily treed areas retain moisture better through percolation downward into the layers below than comparably sized parcels"},{"source":"(CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has won praise for his government's effort to bring about a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, a delicate balancing act for the country's nation's first freely elected leader.

Through those years, the group has grown to about 25 people.  This year, between 22 and 25 people will be attending.\\n\\nOne person in the group (we’ll call him “Sam”) always rents the house for everyone to stay in, and we pay him directly.  Payment determines your rank in who gets first choice in beds.  First to pay gets first choice, etc.  This year, there is enough room for 17 people to get a bed, if every bed that is larger than a twin has two people in it.  Everyone is paying over $300 per person to attend.\\n\\nMy fiancé and I are both going on the trip.  We got to talking about it with another couple, and we felt that we’d be better off getting a condo nearby the house (within 1.5 miles) to guarantee that we get beds and are able to enjoy the trip.  Sam would not be losing any money by us doing this, as he only needed 16 people in order to recoup his money, and 18 people minimum have committed when you take the 4 of us out of the equation.\\n\\nWe brought this idea up to Sam earlier in the day, and didn’t hear back before we had to make a decision on the condo.  After discussing further, we decided to book it, thinking it wouldn’t be a big deal and that everyone would be better off.  More butts in beds, no one is out any money.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Sam and a few others seem to be pretty upset with us, insinuating that we’re screwing up the trip.

Between 1975 and 1986, aspirin or aspirin with dipyridamole has been used for anticoagulation in children receiving a mechanical aortic valve at the University of California, San Francisco. Fifty-one patients (ages 1 to 23 years, mean 12.9 years) were treated with aspirin (n = 45) or aspirin with dipyridamole (n = 6) and observed a mean of 36.5 months (range 3 to 100 months). There were four late deaths: two from endocarditis and two from other medical problems, but none related to thrombosis or embolus. Follow-up was accomplished by direct contact with the patient, parent, or referring physician. Two patients (3.9%) were lost to late follow-up. One minor neurologic event occurred perioperatively and resolved spontaneously. There were no postoperative thromboembolic events. Eleven asymptomatic children were recently studied by magnetic resonance imaging or computed axial tomography of the brain and had no evidence of prior silent cerebral thromboembolic defects. There were four patients (5.9%) who had minor hemorrhagic complications: Three patients had nosebleeds and one patient had an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Five patients were changed to warfarin anticoagulation: the patient with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and four older patients because of physician preference, all after uncomplicated aspirin therapy. There were no mechanical valve failures, although one patient required reoperation 9 months later for perivalvular leak. All children have remained in normal sinus or paced rhythm during follow-up. These results show that children with mechanical aortic valves in normal sinus rhythm can be safely treated with aspirin (or aspirin with dipyridamole) with little risk of thromboembolic events, valve thrombosis, or valve failure. Hemorrhagic complications resulting from aspirin are minor and easily treated.","target":"Aspirin anticoagulation in children with mechanical aortic valves","rationale":"The title should reflect the main findings of the study, which is that children with mechanical aortic valves in normal sinus rhythm can be safely treated with aspirin or aspirin with dipyridamole.

An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body.

Here we report that colloidal gold solutions conjugated with SpA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or gelatin bind selectively to structures in glutaraldehyde-fixed, plastic-embedded epidermis of rabbit, mouse, and human. Two types of keratohyaline granules are present in epidermis, a phosphorus-rich (PR) and a sulphur-rich (SR) type. The PR keratohyaline granules were strongly labeled with gold particles, whereas SR keratohyaline granules or other structures in the living cells of epidermis were unlabeled. The PR keratohyaline granules are assumed to be precursors of the matrix protein of cornified cells, and intense gold labeling occurred over the lower layer of cornified cells (i.e., stratum lucidum). More superficial cornified cells were weakly labeled or unlabeled. The gold labeling pattern was identical whether SpA, BSA, or gelatin was used to stabilize the colloidal gold solution. The mechanism of binding of protein-conjugated gold to PR keratohyaline granules and matrix protein of cornified cells is not clear.

Under that scheme many future Asian leaders studied in Australia. In 1958 the government replaced the Immigration Act's arbitrarily applied European language dictation test with an entry permit system, that reflected economic and skills criteria. In 1962, Menzies' Commonwealth Electoral Act provided that all Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections (prior to this, indigenous people in Queensland, Western Australia and some in the Northern Territory had been excluded from voting unless they were ex-servicemen). In 1949 the Liberals appointed Dame Enid Lyons as the first woman to serve in an Australian Cabinet. Menzies remained a staunch supporter of links to the monarchy and British Commonwealth but formalised an alliance with the United States and concluded the Agreement on Commerce between Australia and Japan which was signed in July 1957 and launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that would steadily climb until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner.","target":"launched post-war trade with Japan","rationale":"The context describes the policies of Sir Robert Menzies while he was Prime Minister.

Passage 1:On 20 October, D-Day for the Leyte landing forces, Mertz escorted landing craft through air attacks to the beach and later in the day patrolled off Dinagat Island at the entrance to Leyte Gulf. Early in the morning of 25 October as the Japanese Southern Force approached Leyte Gulf through the Mindanao Sea, Mertz and patrolled between Desolation Point and Homonhon Island, lest the enemy fleet choose to steam north along the east coast of Dinagat Island to attack the Allied beachhead. When the Japanese entered Surigao Strait, Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf’s force met and destroyed the enemy armada in the classic “crossing-of-the-T” maneuver known as the Battle of Surigao Strait, part of the overall Battle of Leyte Gulf. Later that same day Mertz splashed a Zero at several hundred yards with heavy machinegun fire.\\n Passage 2:On February 6, 2015, Paramount Pictures and New Regency announced that Robert Zemeckis was to direct an untitled World War II romantic thriller, in which Brad Pitt would star.

On June 8, 2015, Marion Cotillard was cast to play a spy along with Pitt, who fall in love during a mission to kill a German official. In August 2015, Knight said that the film would be based on a true story told to him at the age of 21, and also that the shooting would start in January 2016. On January 28, 2016, Jared Harris joined the film. On March 8, 2016, Lizzy Caplan was cast to play Pitt's sister. Executive producers on the film would be Knight, Jack Rapke, Patrick McCormick and Denis O'Sullivan.

He was the bassist in The Bluebells, whose biggest hit was \\"Young at Heart\\", and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions. After the latter group split, Donegan became a journalist and an author. Between these roles, he worked as the House of Commons assistant to Brian Wilson MP. Whilst in that role, he was part of a one-off band called the Stop Its that recorded an anti-poll tax song of a similar name. The band also included David Hill, later press spokesman for Tony Blair. and Tim Luckhurst, who later became editor of The Scotsman newspaper, and is Professor of Journalism at the University of Kent. In the late 1980s, Donegan made a number of appearances with South London football team Belair Casuals FC. He is now a golf journalist for The Guardian, having previously worked at The Scotsman. He has held a post with the former publication since 2004, although he has been at the newspaper since 1994, as a general reporter and then as the Scotland correspondent from 1997 to 2004. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Donegan gained notoriety for his overly critical reviews of the games. Journalists believed that his harsh reviews and similar critiques coming from the British media were made as an attempt to make the games look bad as the following Olympics would be held in London. In 2012, The Guardian made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the severe criticism of the prior Games by inviting a Canadian journalist to similarly critique the Summer Olympics in London as the 'worst ever'.","target":"2","rationale":"Passage 2 is the only passage that contains information regarding the question, as it mentions \\"Alan Silvestri composed the music\\" for a movie in which Brad Pitt was cast.

Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: \\"I don't know where [the songs] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'.\\" Mark Kamins, her first producer, believed that Madonna is \\"a much underrated musician and lyricist.\\" Rolling Stone has named her \\"an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics.\\" According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing \\"incredible\\" hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single \\"Into the Groove\\" and its line \\"Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine.\\" Madonna's songwriting are often autobiographical over the years, dealing with various themes from love and relationships to self-respect and female empowerment. Her songs also speak about taboo and unconventional issues of their period, such as sexuality and AIDS on Erotica (1992). Many of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which lead to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars.

Since estrogens exert major regulatory actions on PRL secretion, the effects of estradiol (E2) on pituitary AII receptors and PRL responses were studied in vivo and in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. In female rats, treatment with E2-containing Silastic capsules for 4 days caused a significant increase in PRA from 1.3 to 3 ng/ml X min and a 38% decrease in the binding of [125I]AII to anterior pituitary membrane-rich fractions (P less than 0.01). In vitro studies showed that treatment of cultured anterior pituitary cells with 1 nM E2 for 4 days caused a 57 +/- 6% decrease in AII receptor concentration with no change in binding affinity. Reduction of AII receptors by E2 in 4-day cultures was dose dependent and was demonstrable with E2 concentrations that occur in plasma during the estrous cycle (0.01-1 nM). The decrease in AII receptors in cells incubated with 1 nM E2 was near maximum after 24 h of culture, and results were similar when receptor concentrations were calculated per unit protein or per cell. Despite the substantial decrease in AII receptors, E2 treatment did not specifically decrease the responsiveness of the pituitary cells to AII stimulation. Thus, PRL responses to AII (10 nM) or TRH (100 nM) were unchanged after 1 day of E2 treatment and were increased after 4 days of treatment. These findings demonstrate that E2 has a direct inhibitory action on expression of pituitary AII receptors that is not accompanied by a decrease in AII-stimulated PRL secretion. In the rat pituitary, estrogen modulation of postreceptor events is the predominant determinant of lactotroph responsiveness during stimulation of PRL release by AII. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides numerical values for the concentrations of hormones and treatments, changes in the binding of AII to anterior pituitary membrane-rich fractions, and changes in the concentrations of AII receptors.

Generally, oxidative stress represents cell toxicity; however, we recently found that oxidative stress promotes the expression of growth factor progranulin (PGRN) in HT22 murine hippocampus cells, thereby protecting the HT22 cells. In this study, we attempted to clarify whether a similar system exists in the other neuronal cell model, rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells.\\", 'After confirming that high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 100-250\\\\xa0μM) initiate PC12 cell death, we analyzed growth factor expressional changes after H2O2 treatment. We found, intriguingly, that gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not PGRN was significantly induced by H2O2. Although little expression of the high affinity BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase TrkB was observed in PC12 cells, expression of low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, was clearly observed. This BDNF signaling appeared to contribute to PC12 cell protection, since PC12 cell death was significantly attenuated by BDNF treatment.","target":"Do subtoxic levels of hydrogen peroxide induce brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression to protect PC12 cells?","rationale":"The given passage mentions that high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 100-250 μM) initiate PC12 cell death.

Bob Tweedy (died Aug. 4, 2017) worked at Alton & Southern Railroad in East St. Louis while Jo Ann was a kitchen designer. Tweedy has three siblings: older brother Greg Tweedy (died in 2013), brother Steven Tweedy, and sister Debbie Voll. Tweedy's mother bought Tweedy his first guitar when he was six years old, although he did not begin to play it seriously until he was twelve.\\n\\nJeff Tweedy was invited to play at Chicago's Noise Pop festival, and was told that he could collaborate with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose Jim O'Rourke based on his fascination with O'Rourke's Bad Timing album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer Glenn Kotche to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named Loose Fur. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche. Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments about how the album should sound between songs. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form. Tweedy also fired Jay Bennett around this time, believing (according to Jay Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member. The band maintains that the firing of Jay Bennett was a collective decision.  Reprise Record's parent company Time Warner merged with America Online in 2001, and the recording company was asked to cut costs. Howie Klein, the CEO of Reprise Records, considered Wilco to be one of the label's core bands, but was offered a lucrative buy-out by AOL Time Warner. Reprise did not consider the album commercially viable and was not interested in releasing the album. David Kahne (Head of A&R) agreed to release Wilco from Reprise records under the condition that Wilco got to keep all legal entitlements to the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album. After an article in the Chicago Tribune publicly described these managerial practices, CEO Gary Briggs quit. Shortly after leaving the label, Briggs remarked:  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was originally scheduled to be released on Reprise on September 11, 2001, prior to the band's departure from Reprise. Seven days later, Tweedy decided that he would stream the entirety of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on Wilco's official website. Over thirty record labels offered to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot after the departure from Reprise was official. One of the thirty was Warner Brothers affiliate Nonesuch Records, who signed Wilco in November 2001. AOL Time Warner paid Wilco to make the album on Reprise, gave them the record for free, and then bought it back on the Nonesuch label. The album was released on April 23, 2002 to significant critical acclaim, including being named the best album of the year by The Village Voice. The album became the biggest hit of Jeff Tweedy's career and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over 500,000 copies.\\n\\nSo what he did next","target":"Reprise Record's parent company Time Warner merged with America Online in 2001, and the recording company was asked to cut costs.","rationale":"The first statement in the context describes CEO Gary Briggs's decision to quit and then mentions that Reprise Records, which is owned by Time Warner, had merged with AOL.\\nThis indicates that this was a significant event immediately preceding his departure from the label.\\n\\n \\nSo, the answer would be:\\n\\"Reprise Record's parent company Time Warner merged with America Online in 2001, and the recording company was asked to cut costs.\\""},{"source":"Two analogies that relate items to whether they are trash or treasure is given in the form \\"A : B.

The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.\\n\\n- A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator.\\n\\n- Canis is a genus of canids containing multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs and coyotes. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails.\\n\\n- Scent hounds (or scenthounds) are a type of hound that primarily hunts by scent rather than sight.

Many patients with suspected bacterial infections are placed on antibiotics before a definite site of infection has been identified. Three hundred twelve leukocyte scans on 271 patients were retrospectively reviewed and classified as positive or negative, and as to whether or not they were being treated with antibiotics at the time the leukocyte scan was performed. The overall sensitivity, considering all 312 studies, was 90%. One hundred sixty-nine patient studies were on patients receiving antibiotics; 143 studies were on patients not on antibiotics. The sensitivity of the leukocyte scan was 88.7% in patients on antibiotic therapy; it was 92.1% in those who were not receiving antibiotics. The differences in sensitivity between the two groups were not significantly different (p less than 0.05).
