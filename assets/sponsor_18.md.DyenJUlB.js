They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than $25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- $3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York.

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\".\\n\\nPreface: my boyfriend (32) and I(28) have been together for 9 months or so. He is very concerned when I want to do things without him. We have come to an agreement to run plans by each other before we make them to be considerate about the other. \\n\\nIssue: A lifelong friend of mine asked me if I wanted to go to go to the big city near by on 420 to celebrate back in january. I told her yes I'd love to. This was before my boyfriend and I came to the agreement.\\n\\nI remembered the plans a few weeks ago and told him about them. He said he'd really really like to go to, because he's never done anything on 420 and would like to experience it. He said he wouldn't mind just sitting near us an playing on his phone or switch. I said of course I would ask her, but since she invited me I can't promise anything. He seemed fine with that.\\n\\nYesterday she texted me to confirm, and I asked if he could come. She said she would really prefer it be just girl time, that she was looking forward to that. When I told my boyfriend, he said that me going without him was a deal breaker for him, and that I either needed to insist that he come along too, or cancel the plans with her instead. I said I would ask one more time, mentioning that he would sit nearby and not bother us, but that I wouldn't absolutely insist he go (I find that incredibly rude, she invited me) or cancel. That was not good enough for him, he said it was a still a deal breaker if I go.\\n\\nAITA for thinking I should go anyway, and that he is being out of line?","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author has made plans with their friend to go somewhere together, and their boyfriend is insisting that he join them. However, the friend had invited the author alone and does not want the boyfriend around.\\\\nThis situation highlights a conflict between two important ethical principles: respect for another person's autonomy and respect for another person's feelings. In this case, respecting the friend's autonomy would mean abiding by her wishes regarding who can join them in going to celebrate 420. In contrast, respecting one's partner means making sure that they are treated with consideration and kindness; it also means taking care of them when they are upset, which is what the boyfriend in this scenario wants his girlfriend to do. \\\\nIn this particular case, however, respect for another person's autonomy should be prioritized over consideration for a partner because having one more person along on an outing might not be much of an inconvenience (the girlfriend could ask her friend again if it was alright), but disregarding someone else's decision about who can or cannot participate in their plans would be disrespectful because it infringes upon their rights as well as ignores their feelings about how they want to spend time with certain people or alone (i.e., without strangers). \\\\nTherefore, following through with her own plans shows respect both for herself (by making decisions according to her own judgement) and for her friend (by respecting her wishes); thus it seems like she acted ethically by choosing not to cancel on her long-time friend; therefore answering \\"RIGHT\\" would be appropriate here.\\""},{"source":"Here's a short story: Mike's desk is not as rough as his table.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO.

Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.\\n\\n- San Bernardino County, officially the County of San Bernardino, is a county located in the southern portion of the U.S. state of California.

It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.\\n\\n- A performance, in the performing arts, generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience. Usually the performers participate in rehearsals beforehand.

The show is set between 1982 and 1987, though Rock was a teenager between 1978 and 1985, being born in 1965. Rock himself grew up with his best friend, Kenny Montero, whom he has often referred to as the inspiration for a lot of the episodes. In many of his interviews, Rock has described Montero as the reason he got into comedy in the first place. The show's title parodies the hit CBS sitcom \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\".\\n\\n- World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- Travis T.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\\n\\n- Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.

Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8 GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4 GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI Radeon or nVidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive.

On offense, the Bears' worst-ranked rushing game (64 yards per game) had a chance to produce against the Packers, who were ranked 30th by allowing 156 yards per game, while opponents had run a league-most 37.3 times per game while scoring an also league-high five rushing touchdowns. Also, Matt Forte had recorded 336 yards and four touchdowns against the Packers in his last two games. The offense also was challenged by the pass defense, with defenders Sam Shields and Tramon Williams, who were stingy in man coverage. For the Bears' defense, the Packers had also struggled on the run, ranking 26th in the league with a 78-yard rushing average and the longest run being of 17 yards, while having averaged only 3.63 yards per carry. Additionally, Green Bay was ranked 28th in the league in yards. However, the team faced the Packers' passing attack, which featured the receiving duo of Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb. The former led the league in targets (37) and first downs (16), while ranking second in receiving yards (351), while the Bears had struggled with covering slant and dig routes, both of which Nelson excelled at. The latter had three touchdowns in 2014, but was used primarily for hitch and stick routes. The Packers were two-point favorites. Sherrick McManis, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Matt Slauson, Jared Allen, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery, and Ryan Mundy served as team captains for the game, while the honorary captains were Dick Butkus and Kurt Becker. The Packers won the coin toss, and decided to kick. On the first drive, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's six-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers responded with Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run. During Chicago's next drive, on 4th and 1, Cutler fumbled the snap, and upon picking up the ball, recorded a 16-yard run on an accidental fumblerooski. The drive continued into the second quarter, ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged touchdowns on the final three plays: Aaron Rodgers' three-yard pass to Nelson, Cutler's eight-yard pass to Jeffery, and Rodgers' 22-yard pass to Cobb. The Bears reached the Packers' nine-yard line by the final play of the first half; on the play, Cutler's pass for Bennett was ruled short of a touchdown. During the television review, Micah Hyde covered the camera angle, preventing the touchdown and ending the half with the Packers leading 21-17. In the third quarter, the Packers drove to the Bears' 34-yard line, where Rodgers completed a touchdown pass to Davante Adams, which would be nullified by a holding penalty on center Corey Linsley; Crosby would eventually kick a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler's pass for Josh Morgan would be tipped by Williams and intercepted by Clay Matthews, with Green Bay capitalizing on the takeaway with Rodgers' 11-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On the next drive, Shields intercepted Cutler, and Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal; however, a holding penalty on Jon Bostic led to Rodgers' three-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. On Chicago's next drive, Williams intercepted Cutler, but the play would be nullified; the Bears would subsequently punt. On the Packers' next drive, they would reach the Bears' 20-yard line before Crosby's field goal was blocked by Willie Young, the first block by the Bears in over a year. Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler on the final drive, and the Bears ran out the clock to end the game. The Bears recorded 496 yards, the first time since 1979 against the Minnesota Vikings that the Bears recorded such yardage and lost. The last time the team recorded more than 496 yards and lost occurred in 1947 against the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Cardinals. Additionally, the rushing attack recorded 102 yards in the first quarter, the first time Chicago recorded at least 100 rushing yards in the first quarter since 2010 against the Carolina Panthers. The game was only the second in NFL history to have no total punts.\\n\\nQuestion about the article:","target":"How many honorary captains were there?","rationale":"The question should be: How many honorary captains were there?"},{"source":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies?\\n\\nPod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.","target":"Deal","rationale":"The article mentions Deal and Donelly, who are both known from their work with the Pixies.

Once used by as many as 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, Wisconsin is currently the longest-running state that offers a broad diploma privilege for admission to its state bar. New Hampshire has offered diploma privilege to students that attend the state's only law school since 2005 and the state of Iowa considered reinstating diploma privilege in 2014. Originally used as a method to foster the growth of formal legal education, the privilege started to fall into disuse early in the 20th century, in common with the tightening of requirements in other learned professions. The privilege was abolished in California in 1917.

Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle.

A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state.\\nNow on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick.\\nUnquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place.\\nWhere the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants.

The virus infects the intestinal epithelium and causes villous atrophy, resulting in diarrhea and dehydration. Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein − through its S1 subunit − with the host cell receptor is the first step in infection and the main determinant for virus tropism. As for several other alphacoronaviruses including the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), the aminopeptidase N (APN) protein was reported to be a functional receptor for PEDV. In this study we examined the role of APN as a receptor. We show that overexpression of porcine APN renders MDCK cells susceptible to TGEV, but not to PEDV. Consistently, unlike TGEV-S1, PEDV-S1 exhibited no binding to cell-surface expressed APN or to a soluble version of APN. Moreover, preincubation of these viruses with soluble APN or pretreatment of APN expressing ST cells with soluble TGEV-S1 blocked TGEV infection, but had no effect on infection by PEDV. The combined observations indicated that APN is not required for PEDV infection. To definitively prove this conclusion, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to knock out APN expression in PEDV-susceptible porcine (ST) and human cell lines (Huh7 and HeLa). As a consequence these cells no longer bound TGEV-S1 and HCoV-229E-S1 at their surface and were resistant to infection by the corresponding viruses. However, genetic ablation of APN expression had no effect on their infectability by PEDV, demonstrating that APN is not essential for PEDV cell entry.","target":"Aminopeptidase N is not required for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus cell entry","rationale":"The title should highlight the key finding that APN is not required for PEDV cell entry.

However, little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the action of homocysteine. The present study investigated the in vitro ability of homocysteine to affect trophoblast gonadotropin secretion and to induce cell death. In primary human trophoblast cells, homocysteine treatment (20 μmol/L) resulted in cellular flattening and enlargement, extension of pseudopodia, and cellular vacuolization. Cellular detachment, apoptosis, and necrosis were favored. With in situ nick end labeling, we investigated DNA degradation, and we used M30 CytoDEATH to selectively stain the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol and DNA cleavage in agarose gel have been investigated. Homocysteine, but not cysteine, induced trophoblast apoptosis and significantly reduced human chorionic gonadotropin secretion. These findings suggest that trophoblast cell death might represent a pathogenic mechanism by which homocysteine may cause pregnancy complications related to placental diseases.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract provides information about the study methods, findings and conclusions.

After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper Danny Aiken, who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center Dominic Raiola. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman Zach Moore by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-2, not only running their winning streak to 7 games, but also making it the 14th straight winning season for the Patriots.\\n\\nQuestion: How many yards was the longest field goal attempt of the game?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"53","rationale":"In the given article, it is mentioned that \\"The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays\\". Therefore we could conclude that Prater missed a 53-yard field goal."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada ( SSHRC ) is the federal research - funding agency that promotes and supports postsecondary - based research and training in the humanities and social sciences .

This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL:\\n\\nand the situation: An inventor named Nelly is tinkering around in her home office where she has created two new types of material that could be used in products. The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table.

When she releases them both at once, you can see how they respond differently—Glubber springs back while Malk stretches out along the floor. Since Glubber resists changing shape with a stronger force than Malk, we can conclude that it is more resistant to change overall.\\nSo, the answer is A: gluber"},{"source":"In this task, you need to replace a letter in the sentence with another given letter.\\n\\nSentence: 'a mirror in a bathroom shower and tiled walls'.

When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, and then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming intermetallic phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates to form different crystal phases, precipitation hardening alloys separate to form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneous, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.","target":"When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, and then harden as they age","rationale":"The alloys discussed in the context are precipitation hardening alloys.

He is best known for his time in WWE, where he won the WWE Tag Team Championship once with Santino Marella. He is trained in freestyle wrestling, rugby, football, sambo, kickboxing, judo, jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts. Prudius has also worked as a stage and screen actor, notably having a small role in Spike Lee's 25th Hour., and a walk-on role in the second season of the HBO series The Wire.\\n\\nOn the April 4, 2008 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov made his official WWE debut as a villain, with the unique quirk of having no entrance music and no Titantron video - his \\"entrance\\" consisted of complete darkness except for a solitary spotlight following him to the ring. He defeated Matt Bentley in his first match, and over the following weeks, Kozlov would go on to easily win several matches, first against local talent and then established names including Colin Delaney, Funaki, Nunzio, Shannon Moore, Jimmy Wang Yang, Jamie Noble, and Domino. On the July 11 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov debuted an entrance theme and Titantron video as he defeated Stevie Richards.  In the following weeks, as Kozlov continued to easily win matches, he began demanding \\"better competition\\". On the September 12 episode of SmackDown, he started to seek that competition, attacking Jeff Hardy. Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose feud between the three of them over the WWE Championship. On the November 7 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE title at Survivor Series after defeating The Undertaker by disqualification after he was attacked by Jeff Hardy. The match was originally intended to include Kozlov, Jeff Hardy, and Triple H, although Hardy was removed due to a storyline injury. The result of this was the addition of Edge to the match while it was in progress, and ultimately Edge would go on to pin Triple H and win the title.  Continuing his pursuit of the WWE Championship, Kozlov competed in and was unsuccessful in winning a Beat the Clock Challenge match against ECW Champion Matt Hardy for another title shot. This led to the two meeting at Armageddon, where Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating Hardy in a non-title match. Kozlov competed in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, entering as the sixth participant, but was eliminated by Triple H after eliminating The Great Khali, Carlito, and Montel Vontavious Porter. He then qualified to be part of the No Way Out Elimination Chamber match, where he was pinned for the first time after receiving a Last Ride from The Undertaker, though he still remained unpinned in one-on-one competition. Kozlov's undefeated streak in televised singles competition ended on the March 2, 2009 episode of Raw, in which he was defeated by Shawn Michaels; this match was for the opportunity to face The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXV. His first televised singles loss on SmackDown came against The Undertaker himself on March 13.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Vladimir Kozlov","rationale":"The context features a paragraph that is describing the life and career of Vladimir Kozlov.

When the British won control over mush of North America in the early 1700s, they brought their tea- drinking habits with them. Tea quickly became the continents most popular drink. As tea could not be grown locally, just as in Britain, it was shipped into the country--mostly from India.\\nIn the early 1700s, the Britain government made a special deal with the East India Company, as an English trading company. They agreed that no other company was allowed to bring tea to Britain or any country controlled by Britain, including America. It was a great deal for the East India Company, since it meant that the company could decide whatever price it wanted for its products. And _ always decided on a high price!\\nIn North America, the local people did not like having to pay such high prices. Instead of overpaying for tea from the British, they turned to Dutch traders, who secretly brought tea to the country that was just as good--and much less expensive. Although this broke the law, the American people didn't care. They got the same cup of tea at a much lower price.\\nThe East India Company, however, didn't like this at all. By the 1760s, they were losing millions of pounds each year to Dutch traders--a huge amount of money in a time when PS60 a year was considered a good income. Instead of reducing their prices to compete with the Dutch, the company asked the British government for help and the government agreed.\\nIn 1767, the British introduced new law that increased the prices of all goods which were brought into America. These laws helped make the East India Company even richer and forced local people to pay much more for everything.

Therefore, Dutch traders brought in cheaper teas to supply the market. The East India Company complained about this competition and asked for help from the British government who began charging high taxes on goods imported into America. This led to resentment against both Britain and the East India company which culminated a few years later in an American rebellion known as the Revolutionary War or American Revolution (1775-83).\\nSo, C is correct answer"},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- Classical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is a term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world.

A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.\\n\\n- The Svans are an ethnic subgroup of the Georgians (Kartvelians) living mostly in Svaneti, a region in northwest Georgia. They speak the Svan language and are mostly bilingual also in Georgian. Both these languages belong to the Kartvelian (South Caucasian) language family.

It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.\\n\\n- The March of Abdülmecid (Turkish: \\"Mecidiye Mar\\") was the national anthem of the Ottoman Empire. The title refers to Abdülmecid I (18391861). There were different anthems for each sultan.\\n\\n- New Rome (Greek:  , \\"Nea Rom\\"; Latin: \\"Nova Roma\\") was a name given by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great in 330 AD to his new imperial capital at the city on the European coast of the Bosporus strait, also known as Byzantium until then, and as \\"Knstantinoúpolis\\" (Constantinople). The city is now known as Istanbul.\\n\\n- Primus inter pares (\\"prtos metax ísn\\") is a Latin phrase meaning first among equals. It is typically used as an honorary title for those who are formally equal to other members of their group but are accorded unofficial respect, traditionally owing to their seniority in office. Historically, the \\"princeps senatus\\" of the Roman Senate was such a figure and initially only bore the distinction that he was allowed to speak first during debate. Also, Constantine the Great was given the role of \\"primus inter pares\\". However, the term is also often used ironically or self-deprecatingly by leaders with much higher status as a form of respect, camaraderie, or propaganda. After the fall of the Republic, Roman emperors initially referred to themselves only as \\"princeps\\" despite having power of life and death over their \\"fellow citizens\\". Various modern figures such as the Chair of the Federal Reserve, the prime minister of parliamentary regimes, the Federal President of Switzerland, the Chief Justice of the United States, and the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church fall under both senses: bearing higher status and various additional powers while remaining still merely equal to their peers in important senses.\\n\\n- The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- The Tanzimât (Ottoman Turkish: , \\"Tanmt\\"), literally meaning \\"reorganization\\" of the Ottoman Empire, was a period of reformation that began in 1839 and ended with the First Constitutional Era in 1876. The \\"Tanzimât\\" reform era was characterized by various attempts to modernize the Ottoman Empire and to secure its territorial integrity against nationalist movements from within and aggressive powers from outside of the state. The reforms encouraged Ottomanism among the diverse ethnic groups of the Empire, attempting to stem the tide of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\". \\n\\n- Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish:    \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him.\\n\\n- Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish:   \\"Mahmud-u sn\\",   \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785  1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I.\\n\\n- The ecumene (US) or oecumene (UK \\"oikoumén\\",  \\"inhabited\\") was an ancient Greek term for the known world, the inhabited world, or the habitable world. Under the Roman Empire, it came to refer to civilization and the secular and religious imperial administration. In present usage, it is used as the noun form of \\"ecumenical\\" and describes the Christian Church as a unified whole or the unified modern world civilization. It is also used in cartography to describe a type of world map (\\"mappa mundi\\") used in late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.\\n\\n- Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\\n\\n- Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.\\n\\n- Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike.\\n\\n- Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. \\n\\n- The Council of Chalcedon (or ) was a church council held from October 8 to November 1, AD 451, at Chalcedon. The Council is numbered as the fourth ecumenical council by the Great Church. A minority of Christians do not agree with the council's teachings. Its most important achievement was to issue the Chalcedonian Definition. The Council's judgements and definitions regarding the divine marked a significant turning point in the Christological debates. Chalcedon was a city in Bithynia, on the Asian side of the Bosphorus; today the city it is part of the Republic of Turkey and is known as Kadköy (a district of Istanbul).\\n\\n- Anthimos V ( Greek :   ' ) was Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople for thirteen months from 1841 to 1842 . He was born in Raidestos ( Tekirda ) and served as Metropolitan of Agathoupolis between 1815 and 1821 , Anchialos between 1821 and 1831 , and Kyzikos between 1831 and 1841 . He was appointed Ecumenical Patriarch when Patriarch Anthimos IV was dismissed by Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I. He died in 1842 and was succeeded by Germanos IV.\\n\\n- The Ecumenical Patriarch (\\"His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch\\") is the Archbishop of ConstantinopleNew Rome and ranks as \\"primus inter pares\\" (first among equals) among the heads of the several autocephalous churches that make up the Eastern Orthodox Church, and is widely regarded as the representative and spiritual leader of the 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. The term \\"Ecumenical\\" in the title historically referred to the Ecumene, a Greek designation for the civilised universe, i.e. the Roman Empire, and legally stems from Canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon.\\n\\n- The Crimean War was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to March 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a \\"greater confusion of purpose\\", yet led to a war noted for its \\"notoriously incompetent international butchery.\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n'anthimus v of constantinople' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'place of death'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1923\\n - africa\\n - alliance\\n - anatolia\\n - battle\\n - bithynia\\n - central\\n - chalcedon\\n - constantine\\n - constantinople\\n - english channel\\n - france\\n - french republic\\n - imperial\\n - istanbul\\n - italy\\n - march\\n - marseille\\n - mediterranean sea\\n - moscow\\n - most\\n - novosibirsk\\n - ottoman empire\\n - paris\\n - re\\n - roma\\n - roman\\n - roman empire\\n - rome\\n - russia\\n - russian empire\\n - saint petersburg\\n - samara\\n - sardinia\\n - sea\\n - switzerland\\n - topkapı palace\\n - turkey\\n - union\\n - united kingdom","target":"istanbul","rationale":"Anthimus V was born in Raidestos (Tekirda) and served as Metropolitan of Agathoupolis between 1815–1821, Anchialos between 1821–1831, and Kyzikos between 1831–1841.

When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP.\\nAs such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization.\\nSadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in.\\nSo much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together.

Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Jon Bluming, Steve Arneil, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. In 1969, Oyama staged \\"The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year.

The parliamentary historian Caroline Shenton has described the tally sticks as \\"roughly as long as the span of an index finger and thumb\\". These sticks were split in two so that the two sides to an agreement had a record of the situation. Once the purpose of each tally had come to an end, they were routinely destroyed. By the end of the eighteenth century the usefulness of the tally system had likewise come to an end, and a 1782 Act of Parliament stated that all records should be on paper, not tallies. The Act also abolished sinecure positions in the Exchequer, but a clause in the act ensured it could only take effect once the remaining sinecure-holders had died or retired. The final sinecure-holder died in 1826 and the act came into force, although it took until 1834 for the antiquated procedures to be replaced. The novelist Charles Dickens, in a speech to the Administrative Reform Association, described the retention of the tallies for so long as an \\"obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom\\"; he also mocked the bureaucratic steps needed to implement change from wood to paper. He said that \\"all the red tape in the country grew redder at the bare mention of this bold and original conception.\\" By the time the replacement process had finished there were two cart-loads of old tally sticks awaiting disposal.In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, received instructions from Treasury officials to clear the old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame.

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.

Recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration. However, these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle. Spinal needles, standard metal intravenous (IV) needles, and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion. These needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg. The site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study. It was found that the 13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi disposable bone marrow/aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion. An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement. This method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients. Intraosseous needle placement is a safe, rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation. By utilizing these techniques, a stable, usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Intraosseous infusions: a usable technique. option2: Enteric coronavirus in symptomless homosexuals [letter]","target":"Intraosseous infusions: a usable technique","rationale":"The title of the abstract should accurately summarize the main idea of this research.

Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew suggested the name Ganoga, an Iroquoian word which he said meant \\"water on the mountain\\" in the Seneca language. Donehoo's A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in  Pennsylvania identifies it as a Cayuga language word meaning \\"place of floating oil\\" and the name of a Cayuga village in New York. Whatever the meaning, Ganoga Lake is the source of the branch of Kitchen Creek that flows through Ganoga Glen, which has the tallest waterfall.A dam was built upstream of the waterfalls on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek in 1842. Ricketts strengthened the dam circa 1905 as part of a hydroelectric power generation scheme, and renamed the body of water Lake Rose (Rose is a Ricketts family name). However, both the Lake Rose and Lake Leigh dams were \\"poorly constructed\\" and could not be used to generate power; both dams were condemned by the state and Lake Rose was drained in 1969. Ganoga Glen is not as steep as Glen Leigh; both glens are almost entirely in the Huntley Mountain Formation, with a small region at the southern end, including Waters Meet, in the Catskill Formation.\\n \\nGanoga Glen has ten named waterfalls in 1.1 miles (1.8 km).

It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good.\\nThe color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, someone who is sick, for example, we say he 'looks green'. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is 'green with envy'.\\nSome people are 'green with envy' because someone else has more dollars, or 'green backs'. Dollars are called 'greenbacks' because that's the color of the backside of the money.\\nBlue is a cool color. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful (  ). To be blue, of course, is to be sad.\\nThe color black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything grows wrong as a 'black day'. A 'black sheep' is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a 'black cat', something unlucky might happen to him. Not all the 'black' expressions have bad meaning. A company 'in the red' is losing money. If someone tells you to put someone 'in black and white', they want you to write it down.\\nQuestion: I was really   _   when I saw his nice new car.\\nOptions: A: red\\nB: blue\\nC: green\\nD: black","target":"C","rationale":"The context of the article discusses how Americans use color to describe various emotions and situations.\\nIn this question, the underlined portion of text implies that someone is upset or jealous because they do not have an object (a new car) that another person has. This can be inferred based on previous phrases from the article: \\"When someone doesn't feel well\\" and \\"when he doesn't have what someone else has\\". Based on these phrases, it can be assumed that 'green with envy' means you are disappointed because you cannot acquire something like a particular item. Therefore, as mentioned in the first part of the question, green is used by Americans to express feelings relating to being upset or sad over material items owned by others.\\n\\n\\nSo I'm pretty sure C should be correct answer but"},{"source":"In the battle of the broadcasters, Sky has announced plans to launch its own mobile network, powered by O2.

In the following eleven centuries, the city had been besieged many times but was captured only once: during the Fourth Crusade in 1204.:304 The crusaders established an unstable Latin state in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne. The Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the Serbians, the Bulgarians, and, most importantly, the Ottoman Turks. The Black Plague between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople. The city was severely depopulated due to the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century Theodosian walls. By 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square miles outside the city of Constantinople itself, the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara, and the Peloponnese with its cultural center at Mystras.

To circumvent this problem and learn on graphs, graph feature representation is required. Main difficulties with feature extraction lie in the trade-off between expressiveness, consistency and efficiency, i.e. the capacity to extract features that represent the structural information of the graph while being deformation-consistent and isomorphism-invariant. While state-of-the-art methods enhance expressiveness with powerful graph neural-networks, we propose to leverage natural spectral properties of graphs to study a simple graph feature: the graph Laplacian spectrum (GLS). We analyze the representational power of this object that satisfies both isomorphism-invariance, expressiveness and deformation-consistency. In particular, we propose a theoretical analysis based on graph perturbation to understand what kind of comparison between graphs we do when comparing GLS. To do so, we derive bounds for the distance between GLS that are related to the divergence to isomorphism, a standard computationally expensive graph divergence. Finally, we experiment GLS as graph representation through consistency tests and classification tasks, and show that it is a strong graph feature representation baseline.","target":"We study theoretically the consistency the Laplacian spectrum and use it as whole-graph embeddding","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe study theoretically the consistency the Laplacian spectrum and use it as whole-graph embeddding."},{"source":"Attack blamed on Lashkar-e-Jhangvi - one of Pakistan's most violent anti-Shi'ite groups and part of an Al Qaeda-linked nexus of militants Karzai cuts Europe trip on future of Afghanistan short to visit injured in hospital By Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent UPDATED: 13:49 EST, 7 December 2011 A former British ambassador to Afghanistan today denounced the 2014 deadline for the withdrawal of troops from the country as a further bombing in the country claimed the lives of 19 civilians.

Recent trials suggest procalcitonin-based guidelines can reduce antibiotic use for respiratory infections. However, the accuracy of procalcitonin to discriminate between viral and bacterial pneumonia requires further dissection. Methods. We evaluated the association between serum procalcitonin concentration at hospital admission with pathogens detected in a multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Systematic pathogen testing included cultures, serology, urine antigen tests, and molecular detection. Accuracy of procalcitonin to discriminate between viral and bacterial pathogens was calculated. Results. Among 1735 patients, pathogens were identified in 645 (37%), including 169 (10%) with typical bacteria, 67 (4%) with atypical bacteria, and 409 (24%) with viruses only. Median procalcitonin concentration was lower with viral pathogens (0.09 ng/ mL; interquartile range [IQR], <0.05-0.54 ng/mL) than atypical bacteria (0.20 ng/mL; IQR, <0.05-0.87 ng/mL; P = .05), and typical bacteria (2.5 ng/mL; IQR, 0.29-12.2 ng/mL; P < .01). Procalcitonin discriminated bacterial pathogens, including typical and atypical bacteria, from viral pathogens with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], .69-.77). A procalcitonin threshold of 0.1 ng/mL resulted in 80.9% (95% CI, 75.3%-85.7%) sensitivity and 51.6% (95% CI, 46.6%-56.5%) specificity for identification of any bacterial pathogen. Procalcitonin discriminated between typical bacteria and the combined group of viruses and atypical bacteria with an area under the ROC curve of 0.79 (95% CI, .75-.82). Conclusions. No procalcitonin threshold perfectly discriminated between viral and bacterial pathogens, but higher procalcitonin strongly correlated with increased probability of bacterial pathogens, particularly typical bacteria. \\n Title: Clinical Infectious Diseases Clinical Infectious Diseases ® 2017;65(2):183-90 Procalcitonin as a Marker of Etiology in Adults Hospitalized With Community-Acquired Pneumonia","target":"True","rationale":"The title summarizes the main findings of the study, which was to evaluate the association between serum procalcitonin concentration at hospital admission and pathogens detected in adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

In the traditional two-stage skin carcinogenesis model, the initiation phase is accomplished by the application of a sub-carcinogenic dose of a carcinogen. Subsequently, tumor development is elicited by repeated treatment with a tumor-promoting agent. The initiation protocol can be completed within 1–3 h depending on the number of mice used; whereas the promotion phase requires twice weekly treatments (1–2 h) and once weekly tumor palpation (1–2 h) for the duration of the study. Using the protocol described here, a highly reproducible papilloma burden is expected within 10–20 weeks with progression of a portion of the tumors to squamous cell carcinomas within 20–50 weeks. In contrast to complete skin carcinogenesis, the two-stage model allows for greater yield of premalignant lesions, as well as separation of the initiation and promotion phases.","target":"False","rationale":"It includes an introduction, basic protocols, and a brief description of results.

Radial piston pumps used in cars and trucks are fuel lubricated, this helps with keeping oil out of the high pressure fuel. Oil in the fuel can raise emissions and clog injectors. Many diesel engines are common rail, which means all the injectors are supplied by one pipe full of high pressure fuel supplied by the fuel pump. Common rails dampen the pressure fluctuations when fuel is used by each injector and pumped into the cylinder. Common rails also make it easier for the fuel pressure to be measured by one device instead of one per cylinder.

The possible adverse effects of a medial tear documented histologically and produced during balloon angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in 30 fully heparinized (100 U/kg body weight) normal pigs. Scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial denudation and extensive platelet deposition in all dilated arterial segments. Visible macroscopic mural thrombus was present within an hour of the procedure in 29 (91%) of the 32 arteries that had a medial tear documented by histologic study; the tear produced an indium-111-labeled platelet deposition of 116.4 +/- 26.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (mean +/- SE) and total thrombotic occlusion in 2 arteries (4%). None of the 24 arteries without a medial tear had a thrombus, and the mean platelet deposition in that group was 7.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(6)/cm2 (p less than 0.0008). In 12 pigs scanned with a gamma camera, visible thrombus was associated with platelet deposition in excess of 20 X 10(6)/cm2 in 12 arteries, 9 of which had a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram. Thus, arterial angioplasty causes deep arterial injury, which appears to be a major cause of mural thrombosis, heavy platelet deposition, a positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram and acute arterial occlusion. A positive indium-111-labeled platelet scintigram was always associated with macroscopic thrombus of at least 20 > 10(6) platelets/cm2 and underlying deep arterial injury. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Biopsy, Needle 2)Diagnosis, Differential 3)Human","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract describes a study of the potential adverse effects of medial tears produced during balloon angioplasty.

Comp B was also a machine, but it applied force over a longer distance. Comp C was not a machine.\\n\\nHint: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done.

It is considered an important symbol of the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of Latvia. Unveiled in 1935, the 42-metre (138 ft) high monument of granite, travertine, and copper often serves as the focal point of public gatherings and official ceremonies in Riga.\\nThe sculptures and bas-reliefs of the monument, arranged in thirteen groups, depict Latvian culture and history. The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other, decreasing in size towards the top, completed by a 19-metre (62 ft) high travertine column bearing the copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars. The concept for the monument first emerged in the early 1920s when the Latvian Prime Minister, Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics, ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a \\"memorial column\\". After several contests the monument was finally built at the beginning of the 1930s according to the scheme \\"Mirdzi kā zvaigzne!\\" (\\"Shine like a star!\\") submitted by Latvian sculptor Kārlis Zāle. Construction works were financed by private donations.\\nFollowing the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered it to be of high artistic value. In 1963, when the issue of demolition was raised again, it was dismissed by Soviet authorities as the destruction of the building would have caused deep indignation and tension in society.

It was the first of what the Chinese later called the \\"unequal treaties\\" on the ground that Britain had no obligations in return.\\n\\n- The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the head and representative of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and head of the Government of Hong Kong. The position was created to replace the Governor of Hong Kong, the representative of the Monarch of the United Kingdom during British rule. The office, stipulated by the Hong Kong Basic Law, formally came into being on 1 July 1997 when the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China.\\n\\n- Central (also Central District) is the central business district of Hong Kong. It is located in Central and Western District, on the north shore of Hong Kong Island, across Victoria Harbour from Tsim Sha Tsui, the southernmost point of Kowloon Peninsula. The area was the heart of Victoria City, although that name is rarely used today.\\n\\n- The term basic law is used in some places as an alternative to \\"constitution\\", implying it is a \\"temporary but necessary measure\\" without formal enactment of constitution. A basic law is either a codified constitution, or in countries with uncodified constitutions, a law given to have constitution powers and effect. The name is usually used to imply an interim or transitory nature, or avoid attempting a claim to being \\"the highest law\\", often for religious reasons. In West Germany the term \\"Basic Law\\" (\\"Grundgesetz\\") was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate reunification of Germany. But in 1990 no new constitution was adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory. Basic law is entrenched in that it overrides ordinary 'statute law' passed by the legislature.\\n\\n- The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- The First Opium War (, 183942), also known as the Opium War and the Anglo-Chinese War, was fought between the United Kingdom and the Qing dynasty over their conflicting viewpoints on diplomatic relations, trade, and the administration of justice for foreign nationals in China.\\n\\n- Hong Kong Island is an island in the southern part of Hong Kong. It has a population of 1,289,500 and its population density is 16,390/km², . The island had a population of about 3,000 inhabitants scattered in a dozen fishing villages when it was occupied by the United Kingdom in the First Opium War. In 1842, the island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the UK under the Treaty of Nanking and the City of Victoria was then established on the island by the British Force in honour of Queen Victoria.\\n\\n- The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.\\n\\n- Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.\\n\\n- Government House ( Chinese :  ; formerly  /  /  ) , located on Government Hill in the Central District of Hong Kong Island , is the official residence of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong . The building was constructed in 1855 as a Colonial Renaissance style , but was significantly remodelled during Japanese occupation , resulting in the current hybrid Japanese - neoclassical form . Government House was the official residence of the Governor from 1855 to 1997 , when the city was under British rule . 25 governors of Hong Kong , out of total 28 , used this building as official residence .\\n\\n- Upper Albert Road is a road on the Government Hill in the Central area of Hong Kong.

It serves as the venue for the Governor's official business, as well as the many receptions and functions hosted by the occupant. Sometimes, \\"Government House\\" is used as a metonym for the Governor or his office.\\n\\n- An official residence is the residence at which a nation's head of state, head of government, governor or other senior figure officially resides. It may or may not be the same location where the individual conducts work-related functions, or actually lives.\\n\\n- A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.\\n\\n- The Government Hill is a hill in Central, Hong Kong, bounded by upper section of Upper Albert Road on the south, Queen's Road Central north, Garden Road east, and Glenealy, west of Hong Kong Island.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'government house' has the relation 'owned by' with?","target":"government of hong kong","rationale":"The entity is \\"government of hong kong\\", the relation between these two entities is \\"owned by\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you will be shown a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending.

Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang.

You may book your dining reservations up to 180 days in advance, and I highly recommend that you do so if you want to dine at any particular restaurants.

On the other hand those going in Fall of 2017 will be able to jump in early and book their holiday a generous 16 months in advance. Those hoping to book airfare as part of their Walt Disney World package should also take note that flights aren’t bookable through Disney until 330 days in advance. Guests do have the option of booking their hotel and tickets and adding on flights at the 330 day mark. For assistance with your Walt Disney World visit, please call (407) 939-5277. 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM Eastern Time. Guests under 18 years of age must have parent or guardian permission to call. How far in advance should I book a Disney Cruise Line vacation? Advance booking is the best way to get a great price and your choice of available staterooms. A. Yes. While you can purchase theme park tickets once you arrive at Walt Disney World Resort, we do recommend that you buy tickets in advance. To make your vacation planning as easy as possible, we suggest one of our Magic Your Way vacation packages, which include both your Disney Resort hotel stay and theme park admission. You can also customize these flexible packages to include airfare, transportation options and a Disney dining plan. Question: How far in advance can I book my trip to Disney World? Answer: Is there a Walt Disney World Holiday in your slightly distant future? Are you waiting eagerly to book your holiday for 2017 onward? If you’re a forward planner like me, its good to know how soon in advance you can actually start planning your trip to the Mouse. Here are the ins and outs of making advance reservations at Disney World. When it comes to Walt Disney World resort rooms they can be purchased up to 499 days in advance. This is good news for those who plan on staying on property but who don’t want to commit to booking a whole package. Walt Disney World vacation packages are also available 499 days in advance technically. The only catch is that Disney doesn’t always release them within that window for instance, packages for 2017 are due to go on sale June 21, 2016. If you have little kids and want them to go to the character breakfasts and stuff then I would say 6 months is a good amount of time. Also where you want to stay is another factor. If you want to stay on Disney property then I would book a room around 6 months in advance to make sure you get exactly what you want.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\\n\\nQuery: SELECT DISTINCT ?x0 WHERE {\\n?x0 a ns:people.person .\\n?x0 ns:influence.influence_node.influenced_by ?x1 .\\n?x0 ns:people.person.spouse_s/ns:people.marriage.spouse|ns:fictional_universe.fictional_character.married_to/ns:fictional_universe.marriage_of_fictional_characters.spouses ?x2 .\\n?x0 ns:people.person.spouse_s/ns:people.marriage.spouse|ns:fictional_universe.fictional_character.married_to/ns:fictional_universe.marriage_of_fictional_characters.spouses M1 .\\n?x1 ns:film.director.film M2 .\\n?x1 ns:film.director.film M3 .\\n?x2 ns:film.editor.film M4 .\\nFILTER ( ?x0 != ?x2 ) .\\nFILTER ( ?x0 != M1 )\\n} Question: What was written by , directed by , and produced by a film director influenced by M1","target":"0","rationale":"In the provided SQL statement, there is a typo at line 8 and the query should be \\"FILTER ( ?x0 != M1 ) .\\"."},{"source":"Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.","target":"John","rationale":"The context tells us that John sold organic produce and milk, whereas Danny did not. Organic foods are likely to be free from agents that can cause human diseases because they do not contain chemical residues or antibiotics, both of which may have harmful effects on humans if consumed in large enough quantities. Since John sold organic food and milk, it is more likely his products were healthier than those produced by Danny who used conventional farming techniques.\\nSo the answer is John (the farmer selling organic produce)."},{"source":"In this task you should classify the given text as 'violence' if there is inhumanity associated with it.

It is a mix of sugar, egg yolks and hot milk, often flavoured with vanilla. Its name may derive from the prevalence of sweet custards in English desserts.\\n\\n- Pudding is a kind of food that can be either a dessert or a savory dish. The word \\"pudding\\" is believed to come from the French \\"boudin\\", originally from the Latin \\"botellus,\\" meaning \\"small sausage\\", referring to encased meats used in medieval European puddings.\\n\\n- Worcestershire (or ; written abbreviation: Worcs) is a county in the West Midlands of England. Between 1974 and 1998, it was merged with the neighbouring county of Herefordshire as Hereford and Worcester.\\n\\n- Hereford and Worcester was an English county created on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 from the areas of the former administrative county of Herefordshire, most of Worcestershire (except Halesowen, Stourbridge and Warley, which became part of the West Midlands) and the county borough of Worcester. An aim of the Act was to increase efficiency of local government: the two counties are among England's smaller and less populous counties, particularly after the same Act transferred some of Worcestershire's most urbanised areas to the West Midlands. The merger aroused much opposition from Herefordshire people, many of whom regarded it as not a merger but a takeover by Worcestershire.\\n\\n- Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called \\"separators\\". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets. Cream has high levels of saturated fat.\\n\\n- Corn starch, cornstarch, cornflour or maize starch or maize is the starch derived from the corn (maize) grain or wheat. The starch is obtained from the endosperm of the kernel. Corn starch is a popular food ingredient used in thickening sauces or soups, and is used in making corn syrup and other sugars.\\n\\n- Gelatin or gelatine (from meaning \\"stiff\\", \\"frozen\\") is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless food derived from collagen obtained from various animal raw materials. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceutical drugs, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called \\"gelatinous\\". Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen, wherein the hydrolysis results in the reduction of protein fibrils into smaller peptides, which will have broad molecular weight ranges associated with physical and chemical methods of denaturation, based on the process of hydrolysis. It is found in most gummy candy, as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin desserts, and some ice creams, dips, and yogurts. Gelatin for recipe use comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- Worcester is a city in Worcestershire, England, southwest of Birmingham and north of Gloucester. The population is approximately 100,000. The River Severn flanks the western side of the city centre, which is overlooked by the 12th-century Worcester Cathedral.\\n\\n- In cooking, a sauce is liquid, cream, or semi-solid food served on or used in preparing other foods. Sauces are not normally consumed by themselves; they add flavor, moisture, and visual appeal to another dish. \\"Sauce\\" is a French word taken from the Latin \\"salsa\\", meaning \\"salted\\". Possibly the oldest recorded European sauce is garum, the fish sauce used by the Ancient Greeks; while doubanjiang, the Chinese soy bean paste is mentioned in \\"Rites of Zhou\\" in 3rd century BC.\\n\\n- Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.\\n\\n- Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as an energy store. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods such as potatoes, wheat, maize (corn), rice, and cassava.\\n\\n- Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.\\n\\n- A gel is a solid jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute cross-linked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinking within the fluid that gives a gel its structure (hardness) and contributes to the adhesive stick (tack). In this way gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid in which the solid is the continuous phase and the liquid is the discontinuous phase. The word \\"gel\\" was coined by 19th-century Scottish chemist Thomas Graham by clipping from \\"gelatine\\".\\n\\n- Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.\\n\\n- Quiche is a savoury, open-faced pastry crust with a filling of savoury custard with one or more of cheese, meat, seafood or vegetables. Quiche can be served hot or cold. It is part of French cuisine but is also popular in other countries, particularly as party food.\\n\\n- Dessert is a course that concludes a main meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods and beverages, such as dessert wine or liqueurs, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.\\n\\n- Custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk. Depending on how much egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (\\"crème anglaise\\") to a thick pastry cream (French: \\"crème pâtissière\\") used to fill éclairs. Most common custards are used as desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla. Custard bases may also be used for quiches and other savory foods. Sometimes flour, corn starch, or gelatin is added as in pastry cream or \\"crème pâtissière\\".\\n\\n- Malvern pudding is a traditional pudding from the English town of Malvern in Worcestershire . It is a baked dish made with apples or other seasonal fruit and custard although variations exist . It was listed as one of the ten most \`\` threatened puddings '' after a survey conducted by UKTV Food .\\n\\n- Herefordshire (abbreviated Herefs. or Hfds.) is a historic English county in the West Midlands. It is a ceremonial county and a unitary non-metropolitan county and district, also named in legislation as the County of Herefordshire and governed by Herefordshire Council. It borders the English ceremonial counties of Shropshire to the north, Worcestershire to the east, Gloucestershire to the south-east, and the Welsh preserved counties of Gwent to the south-west and Powys to the west. The Welsh unitary county covering the part of Gwent next to Herefordshire is Monmouthshire.\\n\\n- Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'has part' with the subject 'malvern pudding'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1\\n - a\\n - bean\\n - bread\\n - carbon\\n - cereal\\n - channel\\n - chocolate\\n - corn starch\\n - corn syrup\\n - cream\\n - custard\\n - egg\\n - england\\n - english\\n - europe\\n - fish\\n - flat\\n - flour\\n - french\\n - gelatin\\n - glucose\\n - history\\n - human\\n - hydrogen\\n - ice\\n - liquid\\n - maize\\n - milk\\n - oxygen\\n - part\\n - pastry\\n - product\\n - protein\\n - sausage\\n - soy\\n - starch\\n - state\\n - system\\n - vanilla\\n - wales\\n - water\\n - wine","target":"egg","rationale":"Malvern pudding is made with apples or other seasonal fruit and custard, which consists of milk and egg yolk.

He builds a large estate where his oldest son, Ignatz, falls in love with his first cousin, Valerie, despite the disapproval of Emmanuel and Rose. Ignatz, while studying in law school, begins an affair with Valerie. Ignatz graduates and later earns a place as a respected district judge, when he is asked by the chief judge to change his Jewish surname in order to be promoted to the central court. The entire generation – Ignatz, his physician brother Gustave and photographer cousin Valerie – change their last name to Sors (\\"fate\\"), a more Hungarian-sounding name. Ignatz then gets promoted when he tells the Minister of Justice a way to delay the prosecution of corrupt politicians.\\nIn the spring of 1899, when Valerie becomes pregnant, she and Ignatz happily marry before the birth of their son, Istvan. Their second son, Adam, is born in 1902. Ignatz continues to support the Habsburg monarchy, while Gustave pushes for a communist revolution. Both brothers enlist in the Austro-Hungarian Army as officers during World War I.

Two important populations of helper T cells are the proinflammatory, interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing (Th17) cells and the anti-inflammatory forkhead box P3-positive (FoxP3(+)) T regulatory (Treg) cells. Here we show that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and other agonists of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) inhibit the formation of Th17 cells and promote FoxP3 expression. Conversely, inhibition of retinoic acid signaling constrains transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) induction of FoxP3. The effect of ATRA is mediated independently of IL-2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) and Stat3, representing a novel mechanism for the induction of FoxP3 in CD4 T cells. As previous studies have shown that vitamin A derivatives are protective in animal models of autoimmune disease, the current data suggest a previously unrecognized role for RARalpha in the regulation of CD4(+) T-cell differentiation and provide a mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of retinoic acid..

He holds the NFL single-season touchdown reception record (23 in 2007), the NFL single-season touchdown reception record for a rookie (17 in 1998), and is second on the NFL all-time regular season touchdown reception list with 156. Moss played college football for Marshall University, and twice earned All-America honors. He was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round of the 1998 NFL Draft, where he played for seven years before a trade in 2005 brought him to the Oakland Raiders.\\nContext: Moss's dream was to play for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, but he also considered going to Ohio State, where his half-brother, Eric, had played offensive tackle. Former Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz said \\"Randy Moss was the best high school football player I've ever seen.\\" Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden said \\"He was as good as Deion Sanders. Deion's my measuring stick for athletic ability, and this kid was just a bigger Deion.\\"  After originally signing a letter of intent to play college football with Notre Dame in 1995, Moss took part in a racially charged fight at his high school that left one person hospitalized. On March 23, 1995, Moss had backed a friend in a hallway fight against a white student who had allegedly used racist comments towards Randy's friend. Moss was initially charged with a felony for kicking the student, but it was later reduced to a misdemeanor. On August 1, 1995, Moss pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor battery and was sentenced to 30 days behind bars at the South Central Regional Jail in Charleston, West Virginia. He served 3 days in jail starting that night and would be required to serve the remaining 27 days within the following 18 months, after he completed his freshman year in college. Moss was expelled from DuPont and completed his education at Cabell Alternative School.  Notre Dame subsequently denied his enrollment application, but this did not stop another high-profile college football program from giving him a chance.

At various points in his life, Russell considered himself a liberal, a socialist and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had \\"never been any of these things, in any profound sense\\". Russell was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom. In the early 20th century, Russell led the British \\"revolt against idealism\\".\\n\\nRussell won a scholarship to read for the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, and commenced his studies there in 1890, taking as coach Robert Rumsey Webb. He became acquainted with the younger George Edward Moore and came under the influence of Alfred North Whitehead, who recommended him to the Cambridge Apostles. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh Wrangler in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.  Russell first met the American Quaker Alys Pearsall Smith when he was 17 years old. He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family - they knew him primarily as \\"Lord John's grandson\\" and enjoyed showing him off. He traveled with them to the continent; it was in their company that Russell visited the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and was able to climb the Eiffel Tower soon after it was completed.  He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, who was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage and they finally divorced in 1921, after a lengthy period of separation. During this period, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Lady Ottoline Morrell and the actress Lady Constance Malleson. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the English governess and writer, and first wife of T. S.

My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter.\\nIf you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well.\\nI still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees.\\nDon’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends\\nJust because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you.

Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height.

Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian architect during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, which would have been unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.\\nA second hindrance to Sicilian architects' fully achieving their potential earlier was that frequently they were only rebuilding a damaged structure, and as a consequence having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, $8,033/ha and $13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms.

Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer from Warner Bros., who soon released her debut album, Bonnie Raitt, in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.  While admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, Give It Up, was released in 1972 to universal \\"acclaim\\"; though many critics still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's Takin' My Time was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.

Newer nonionic contrast agents have been shown to have fewer adverse hemodynamic, inotropic, and rheologic effects compared with ionic media and it has been suggested that they might not substantially affect coronary blood flow. Six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. Intracoronary injections of iohexol (300 mg/ml iodine) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function. Two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml/sec; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml/sec. The 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31% (p less than .01) and 77% (p less than .001). The 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml/sec 77% (p less than .001) and 69% (p less than .001). The magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose, and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection. Decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19% to 29%. The effects on regional myocardial function were independent of contrast volume. However, the degree of dysfunction was more profound with slower infusion rates, suggesting that prolongation of contrast-induced ischemia was a major modulating factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides numerical values and measurements to describe the results of the study.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited.

From 1976 onward he was also the country's official head of state as chairman of the State Council following Willi Stoph's relinquishment of the post. Honecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned during the Nazi era. Following World War II, he was freed and soon relaunched his political activities, founding the youth organisation the Free German Youth in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955.\\n\\nIn May 1945 Honecker was \\"picked up\\" by chance in Berlin by Hans Mahle and taken to the Ulbricht Group, a collective of exiled German communists that had returned from the Soviet Union to Germany after the end of the Nazi regime. Through Waldemar Schmidt, Honecker befriended Walter Ulbricht, who had not been aware of him at that point. Honecker's future role in the group was still undecided until well into the summer months, as he had yet to face a party process. This ended in a reprimand due to his \\"undisciplined conduct\\" in fleeing from prison at the start of the year, an action which was debated upon it jeopardizing the other (communist) inmates.  In 1946 he became the co-founder of the Free German Youth (FDJ), whose chairmanship he also undertook. After the formation of the SED, the Socialist Unity Party, in April 1946 through a merger of the KPD and SPD, Honecker swiftly became a leading party member and took his place in the party's Central Committee.  On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic was formed with the adoption of a new constitution, establishing a political system similar to that of the Soviet Union. Within the state's socialistic single party government, Honecker determinedly resumed his political career and the following year was nominated as a candidate for the Politburo of the SED's Central Committee. As President of the Free German Youth movement, he organised the inaugural \\"Deutschlandtreffen der Jugend\\" in East Berlin in May 1950 and the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students in 1951, although the latter was beset with organisational problems.  During the internal party unrest following the suppressed uprising of June 1953, Honecker sided with First Secretary Walter Ulbricht, despite the majority of the Politburo attempting to dispose Ulbricht in favour of Rudolf Herrnstadt. Honecker himself though faced questioning from party members about his inadequate qualifications for his position. On 27 May 1955 he handed the Presidency of the FDJ over to Karl Namokel, and departed for Moscow to study for two years at the School of the Soviet Communist Party at Ulbricht's request. During this period he witnessed the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in person, where its First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev denounced Joseph Stalin.  After returning to East Germany in 1958 Honecker became a fully-fledged member of the Politburo, taking over responsibility for military and security issues. As the Party Security Secretary he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 and also a proponent of the \\"order to fire\\" along the Inner German border.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What did Walter Ulbricht have to  do with it?","target":"Honecker sided with First Secretary Walter Ulbricht, despite the majority of the Politburo attempting to dispose Ulbricht in favour of Rudolf Herrnstadt.","rationale":"The answer is given in the article: \\"Honecker sided with First Secretary Walter Ulbricht, despite the majority of the Politburo attempting to dispose Ulbricht in favour of Rudolf Herrnstadt."},{"source":"Background: Conacher was born in Toronto, Ontario on May 24, 1900. His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters.\\nContext: Rugby football was the first sport Conacher played, and it was his favourite. He first played organized football at the age of 12 as a middle wing with the Capitals in the Toronto Rugby Football League. He played four seasons with the team between 1912 and 1915, during which the Capitals won the city championship each year. He won the Ontario championship as a junior with the Toronto Central YMCA in 1918, and in 1919 moved up to the intermediate level. With the intermediate Capitals, he was moved into an offensive role as a halfback. He excelled in the role, and his team reached Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) final. In that final, the Capitals' opponents from Sarnia made stopping Conacher their priority, a strategy that proved the difference as Sarnia won the championship.  Conacher moved to the senior level in 1920 with the Toronto Rugby Club where his team again won the ORFU championship, but lost the eastern semifinal to the Toronto Argonauts of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). His play impressed the Argonauts, who signed him for the 1921 season. In his first game with the Argonauts, he scored 23 of the team's 27 points, and led the IRFU in scoring, accounting for 14 touchdowns and 90 of his team's 167 points as they went undefeated in six games. The Argonauts won the eastern championship, and faced the Edmonton Eskimos (renamed Edmonton 'Elks' in 1922) in the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history. Conacher rushed for 211 yards and scored 15 points in Toronto's 23-0 victory to claim the national title.  Named captain in 1922, Conacher led the Argonauts to another undefeated season in IRFU play, finishing with five wins and one tie, as he rushed for about 950 yards. The Argonauts reached the Eastern final, but lost to Queen's University, 12-11.

The topology of Tiruchirappalli is almost flat, with an average elevation of 88 metres (289 ft). A few isolated hillocks rise above the surface, the highest of which is the Rockfort; its estimated age of 3,800 million years makes it one of the oldest rocks in the world.

The land immediately surrounding the Kaveri River—which crosses Tiruchirappalli from west to east—consists of deposits of fertile alluvial soil on which crops such as finger millet and maize are cultivated. Further south, the surface is covered by poor-quality black soil.

Tectonic plates are large pieces of rock which make up Earth's crust and uppermost mantle, forming our planet’s surface layer. These plates slowly move relative to each other due to convection currents in the underlying magma or semi-molten rock of the earth's interior (known as molten metal). Sometimes these movements cause earthquakes when two tectonic plates collide with each other.

Natural resources may be renewable or non-renewable. Non-renewable resources cannot be replaced. When they're gone, they're gone. Renewable resources can be replaced. They can supply human activities forever. Fossil fuels are crucial for modern human society. Fossil fuels are essential for transportation, industry and agriculture. Renewable energy resources tend to be clean. They emit fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. Renewable resources often have other problems.

The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

TL;DR at bottom.\\n\\nBackground\\nBasically, my parents had a car several years ago and I was told that when I started needing a car, it would be mine. Then, in my sophomore year of high school, they replaced it with another one they bought for $300. Since it took the place of the old one, I asked if this one would be mine when I needed a car and they said yes. \\n\\nFor $300 it was great, the only major repair it needed was new motor mounts. (Well, not really, but we'll get to that.) My brother drove us to school in it at first. I then learned how to drive in it, and everybody liked it. My dad actually took it on a road trip and it held up great.\\n\\nThat is, until, oil started disappearing. It wasn't leaking, the motor was just burning it. My dad told all of us (my mom, bro and I) that the oil HAD to be checked EVERY TIME before it was driven and added so we didn't destroy it. \\n\\nOne day, my mother needed to go to the store. She wanted to drive my (future) vehicle, but she didn't check the oil (more on this later), drove it a few miles on no oil, and blew the motor. It sat for several months, and my parents were planning on paying someone to haul it and scrap it.\\n\\nAfter those months I decide I wanted a car, and I had some money saved up. I didn't have the money to buy a car that would actually last, but I had enough to fix the broken down one. So I asked my parents if instead of them paying someone to haul it off if I could fix it and keep it for myself instead, and they said sure. (Note, I didn't act entitled saying \\"you're getting rid of it anyway so you should just give it to me.\\" I simply asked them if they'd be open to the idea and they said yes.)\\n\\nFast forward to now. \\n\\nIt's been about 3 years of hard working with the aid of my grandfather, and after rebuilding the motor I finally have it running. But the trouble didn't end there. I don't want anyone else driving it. Period. It's my baby, and after all the time, sweat, and my own hard earned money doing labor for my great uncle (About $1800) I'm not taking chances. However, I've told my parents if they ever need a ride they just need to ask and I will if I can, and I only ask that they come with me so if something happens I'm not stranded alone.\\n\\nThe problem now is that my mother doesn't like that. She doesn't have a car of her own, so she thinks that I should let her drive my vehicle. \\n\\nBut she hates it. She didn't say so before, but once I started rebuilding it and really cemented it as mine, she'd start saying things about hating it and stuff. \\n\\nBut she demands that if she ever needs to/feels like driving it I should just let her because she says so. \\n\\nI explain to her that I do NOT want her driving it because she destroyed it in the first place. She knew that she had to make sure it had oil first, but refused to check because she is \\"a woman and car maintenance is a man's responsibility\\" and thought that fallacy would magically make an engine run perfect with no oil whatsoever. But even then she could have asked my dad to since he was home, but she was too lazy to ask. When I bring up how this is literally wrong, an engine doesn't care who you are and running with no oil is going to destroy it, she refuses to understand it and still thinks that because she's a woman she can destroy an engine then refuse to accept fault, because she's a woman and that's not her responsibility, and I'm an idiot for thinking otherwise.\\n\\nHowever, she was also rear ended in a rental car in August, and due to some neck damage she should not be driving. So it's not even safe for her to drive. I bring this up too, but she won't even acknowledge this. The only time she does is when dad asks her to drive somewhere, then this \\"injury\\" becomes super convenient for her to say no.\\n\\nShe then demands that if she ever needs it she should be allowed to drive it, because it's still in my parents' name and they pay the insurance, and for my gas.\\n\\nNow, every time she brings this up, I very respectfully tell her if it's that much of an issue to just stop paying it. But I also bring up the fact that 1) They still pay for my brother's insurance, even though he now lives in another state and does not support us at all (understandably), 2) she would never even consider driving his car without his permission 3) Before he moved out, he lived here for 2 years after high school with no job, except for one that lasted a few months, flunked out of college his first semester and wracked up a ton of debt, yet they still paid for his gas and insurance 4) I just graduated high school in May, and finished trade school with my Associates in June with hardly any debt (I went half time for free in high school) and without having a working vehicle until December made it virtually impossible to get a job.\\n\\nWhen we get into these arguments about it, I make sure that I'm very respectful, even though she acts like I'm Charles Mansen. I also make it clear that I'm not forcing them to pay for anything, just that it'd be really dickish to stop compared to everything they did for my brother (who I have no resentment toward for any of this). I literally shut down all of her arguments just by calmly and respectfully stating facts. The result is always her screaming something, such as the whole theme for this sub, \\"YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE SHUT UP GET OUT\\".\\n\\nWondering what my dad thinks? He knows where I'm coming from, knows that I'm right, but just hits the yeet and dodges the conversation.\\n\\nI think she's really just mad that she doesn't have a car of her own, and she's spiting me because unlike her when I decided I wanted a vehicle I actually did something about it. She just plays the \\"pity me\\" game and complains about not having a car while doing nothing to help herself. Granted, she works all day prepping decals for a printing company, but over several years you'd think she'd at least try to figure something out.\\n\\nAlso, looking at how she treated my brother vs. me on the whole car situation, it's obvious she has little actual respect for me, and all the time and money I've put into it. I'm also fairly certain she's mad because I'm not just doing whatever she says blindly and actually calling her out when she has zero justification, and I have valid points to prove it.\\n\\nOverall, I'm not caving and letting her (or anyone else) drive my vehicle because I know she wouldn't care if she destroyed all my hard work and time, and might actually be happy to. I've worked hard on it and it is mine in every way except on the title (so far).\\n\\nTL;DR- My mom destroyed the engine of the vehicle that was supposed to me mine, and after spending $1800 of my own money and 3 years rebuilding it, she's mad I won't let her drive it because I don't want it destroyed again.\\n\\n\\nSo am I really the asshole here? I'm not a saint and I won't claim to be, but I try as hard as I can to be reasonable but my mother still gets mad at me.","target":"no","rationale":"The mother is angry that her daughter does not want her to drive the car, which was supposed to be hers. However, the mother destroyed the car in the past and should understand why she may not want to allow her to drive it. The daughter has worked hard on rebuilding it, so of course she would be hesitant about letting someone else drive it. The daughter asks if they can stop paying for the car if they feel that strongly about it, but they won't do so because then they would not have anything to complain about. Therefore, nobody is wrong in this situation and there's no need for anyone else besides their immediate family members and friends who already know what happened (and probably don't care either way) to get involved or judge them."},{"source":"Question: \\"Who happened after the uprising?\\"\\n\\nContext: \\"Accusing the rebels of being \\"drugged\\" and linked to al-Qaeda, Gaddafi proclaimed that he would die a martyr rather than leave Libya.

The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.\\n\\n- Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring.\\n\\n- The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.\\n\\n- In contrast to the hiragana syllabary, which is used for those Japanese language words and grammatical inflections which kanji does not cover, the katakana syllabary usage is quite similar to italics in English; specifically, it is used for transcription of foreign language words into Japanese and the writing of loan words (collectively \\"gairaigo\\"); for emphasis; to represent onomatopoeia; for technical and scientific terms; and for names of plants, animals, minerals, and often Japanese companies.\\n\\n- Nozomi Witches (    Nozomi Uicchizu ) , sometimes also called Bewitching Nozomi , is a manga series by Toshio Nobe which was adapted into a three episode anime OVA series in 1992 . Because of similarities with Mitsuru Adachi 's style , and the fact that the OVA adaptation was made by the team that worked on several of his anime adaptations , Nozomi Witches is sometimes mistakenly attributed as one of Adachi 's works .\\n\\n- Early life.\\nTezuka was the eldest of three children in Toyonaka City, Osaka. His nickname was \\"gashagasha-atama\\" (\\"gashagasha\\" is slang for messy, \\"atama\\" means head). His mother often comforted him by telling him to look to the blue skies, giving him confidence. His mother's stories inspired his creativity as well. Tezuka grew up in Takarazuka City, Hygo and his mother often took him to the Takarazuka Theatre. The Takarazuka Revue is performed by women, including the male characters. The Takarazuka Revue is known for its romantic musicals usually aimed at a female audience, thus having a large impact on the later works of Tezuka, including his costuming designs. He has said that he has a profound \\"spirit of nostalgia\\" for Takarazuka.\\n\\n- Kanji, or \\"kan'ji\\", are the adopted logographic Chinese characters (') that are used in the modern Japanese writing system along with hiragana and katakana.

The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the .\\n\\n- Hiragana and katakana are both kana systems. With one or two minor exceptions, each sound in the Japanese language (strictly, each mora) is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system. This may be either a vowel such as \\"\\"a\\"\\" (hiragana ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as \\"\\"ka\\"\\" (); or \\"\\"n\\"\\" (), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English \\"m\\", \\"n\\", or \\"ng\\", or like the nasal vowels of French. Because the characters of the kana do not represent single consonants (except in the case of  \\"n\\"), the kana are referred to as syllabaries and not alphabets.\\n\\n- In manga and anime.\\n\\"Bishjo\\" characters are seen in almost all genres of anime and manga, especially in dating sims and visual novels (also known as bishjo games), and harem anime and manga. It is sometimes confused with the similar-sounding \\"shjo\\" demographic, but \\"bishjo\\" refers to the gender and traits of the characters whereas \\"shjo\\" refers to the audience. Although \\"bishjo\\" is not a genre but a character design, series which predominantly feature such characters, such as harem or visual novels, are sometimes informally called \\"bishjo\\" series. Since one of the main draws of these series is typically the art and the attractive female characters, the term is occasionally perceived negatively, as a genre which is solely dependent on the marketability of cute characters rather than content or plot.\\n\\n- Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\\n\\n- Seinen manga have a wide variety of art styles and variation in subject matter. Examples of seinen series include: \\"20th Century Boys\\", \\"Akira\\", \\"Tokyo Ghoul\\", \\"Berserk\\", \\"Mushishi\\", \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", \\"Planetes\\", \\"Maison Ikkoku\\", and the formerly shnen manga \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\\".\\n\\n- The term \\"manga\\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana:  or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \\"Manga\\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan.\\n\\n- Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'main subject' with the subject 'nozomi witches'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- anime\\n - art\\n - baseball\\n - boxing\\n - cat\\n - city\\n - comedy\\n - comic\\n - design\\n - dream\\n - europe\\n - extraterrestrial life\\n - fiction\\n - film\\n - game\\n - genius\\n - ghost\\n - harem\\n - high school\\n - history\\n - internet\\n - kanji\\n - language\\n - life\\n - russia\\n - science\\n - sport\\n - supernatural\\n - television\\n - time\\n - time travel\\n - war\\n - writer","target":"sport","rationale":"The rationale here is that the \\"nozomi witches\\" anime series was about a sport."},{"source":"I have a new situation: Reed started studying protozoa and was more interested in the predatorial behaviors of protozoa, while Brad wanted to know more about other types of protozoa, suck as grazers and decomposers.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms.

Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The $6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations.

Between The Dalles and Portland, the river cuts through the Cascade Range, forming the dramatic Columbia River Gorge. No other rivers except for the Klamath and Pit River completely breaches the Cascades—the other rivers that flow through the range also originate in or very near the mountains. The headwaters and upper course of the Pit River are on the Modoc Plateau; downstream the Pit cuts a canyon through the southern reaches of the Cascades. In contrast, the Columbia cuts through the range nearly a thousand miles from its source in the Rocky Mountains. The gorge is known for its strong and steady winds, scenic beauty, and its role as an important transportation link. The river continues west, bending sharply to the north-northwest near Portland and Vancouver, Washington, at the Willamette River confluence. Here the river slows considerably, dropping sediment that might otherwise form a river delta. Near Longview, Washington and the Cowlitz River confluence, the river turns west again. The Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean just west of Astoria, Oregon, over the Columbia Bar, a shifting sandbar that makes the river's mouth one of the most hazardous stretches of water to navigate in the world. Because of the danger and the many shipwrecks near the mouth, it acquired a reputation as the \\"Graveyard of Ships\\".The Columbia drains an area of about 258,000 square miles (670,000 km2).

They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake. \\nBased on the previous passage, Do mountain streams flow more slowly than rivers flowing over gentle slopes? \\nIs \\"No. (Rivers flowing over gentle slopes move much more slowly than mountain streams.)\\" a correct answer?","target":"Yes","rationale":"Mountain streams are rivers that flow through mountainous regions. These rivers typically have steep slopes and many obstacles in their path, so they tend to move more quickly than other types of river systems. In contrast, a gentle slope is any area where the elevation changes slowly over time. Gentle slopes don't require water to speed up or slow down as much as it would on steeper terrain, which causes them to move more slowly than mountain streams.\\nBased on this information, there is no evidence within the reading passage stating that mountain streams flow slower than rivers flowing over gentle slopes; therefore \\"No\\" is not a correct answer for this question. The only option given for an answer (Yes) does correspond with what was stated about mountainous areas vs flat lands within the passage though - thus making Yes a"},{"source":"In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

At present, the data have been predominantly obtained using established cell lines and/or CXCR4-tropic laboratory-adapted virus strains. There is also ambiguity about which disulfide isomerases/ reductases play a major role in HIV-1 entry, as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and/or thioredoxin (Trx) have emerged as the two enzymes most often implicated in this process. We have extended our previous findings and those of others by focusing on CCR5-using HIV-1 strains and their natural targets -primary human macrophages and CD4 + T lymphocytes. We found that the nonspecific thiol/ disulfide exchange inhibitor, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), significantly reduced HIV-1 entry and infection in cell lines, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and also phytohemagglutinin (PHA)stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Subsequent studies were performed using specific anti-PDI or Trx monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped and wild type (wt) virus infection systems. Although human donor-to-donor variability was observed as expected, Trx appeared to play a greater role than PDI in HIV-1 infection of MDM. In contrast, PDI, but not Trx, was predominantly involved in HIV-1 entry and infection of the CD4 + /CCR5 + T cell line, PM-1, and PHA-stimulated primary human T lymphocytes. Intriguingly, both PDI and Trx were present on the surface of MDM, PM-1 and PHA-stimulated CD4 + T cells. However, considerably lower levels of Trx were detected on freshly isolated CD4 + lymphocytes, compared to PHA-stimulated cells. Conclusions: Our findings clearly demonstrate the role of thiol/disulfide exchange in HIV-1 entry in primary T lymphocytes and MDM. They also establish a cell-type specificity regarding the involvement of particular disulfide isomerases/reductases in this process and may provide an explanation for differences among previously published studies. More importantly, from an in vivo perspective, the preferential utilization of PDI may be relevant to the HIV-1 entry and establishment of virus reservoirs in resting CD4 + cells, while the elevated levels of Trx reported in the chronic stages of HIV-1 infection may facilitate the virus entry in macrophages and help to sustain high viremia during the decline of T lymphocytes. \\n Title: Cell-type specific requirements for thiol/disulfide exchange during HIV-1 entry and infection","target":"True","rationale":"The title accurately describes the content of the paragraph.

All of the gang members are sons of gangsters, which makes it even harder for them to get paroled. They tell their superintendent this, and that they have no sponsor.  To remedy this, Miss Crookshank asks the leader of the boys fathers' gang, Valentine, to come to her office. Valentine is barely released from prison. He is reluctant to help the boys, arguing that he is a reformed man and is now living on a farm with his wife Molly and their daughter Pat. He has also decided to take a new name, \\"Ryan.\\"\\nMiss Crookshank explains the boys' predicament, however, and Valentine agrees to take them in under his wings. One of the younger members of the gang, Pesky, is also taken in by the ex-gangster. The would-be mobsters in reformatory are quite disappointed when they are sent away to the horse-breeding farm in the country instead of out into the city streets. When the boys are transported out to the farm, a gangster named Spike the Butcher, who had killed Valentine's men ten years earlier, follows Valentine to his farm in hopes of finishing the job and kill Valentine too. Spike brings his two henchmen, Creeper and Dingbat, to ambush Valentine/Ryan in his new home. District attorney Paul Revere Smith, who is Pat's boyfriend, arrives at the farm at the same time.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states 'albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves' on the 'basis of reciprocity'. EU law would not 'be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.' This meant any 'subsequent unilateral act' of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In 'accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,' said the Court of Justice, the 'directly applicable measures of the institutions' (such as the Regulations in the case) 'render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law'. This was necessary to prevent a 'corresponding denial' of Treaty 'obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states', that could 'imperil the very foundations of the' EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.

At one pole are those who view the Federal Judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being \`\`the most separated and least checked of all branches of government.'' Indeed, federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure \`\`during good behavior,'' and their pay may \`\`not be diminished'' while they hold their position (Section 1 of Article Three). Though subject to the process of impeachment, only one Justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court Justice has been removed from office. At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch, with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government. The Supreme Court, it is noted, cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments. One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in Worcester v. Georgia. President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, \`\`John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!''; however, this alleged quotation has been disputed. Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment Brown v. Board of Education. More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the Court's order in United States v. Nixon (1974) to surrender the Watergate tapes. Nixon, however, ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling. \\n\\nHaving read that, I wonder can us supreme court justice be removed from office?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The quote mentions that Supreme Court Justices are held to their position \`\`during good behavior''.

Therefore, it is possible for US Supreme Court justices to be removed from office, so the answer is Yes."},{"source":"Energy often changes from one form to another.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis.

Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied Yemen and Algeria, frequently as provincial governors.","target":"made up a significant proportion","rationale":"The context mentions the role of Greeks in the Ottoman army and navy.

But new research using an artificial egg, which is equipped to measure heart rates, disputes this.  Scientists from the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge say that a slow moving human who does not approach the nest too closely, is not viewed as a threat by penguins.\\nThe earlier findings have been used to partly explain the 20 per cent drop in populations of certain types of penguins near tourist sites.  However, tour operators have continued to insist that their activities do not adversely affect wildlife in Antarctica, saying they encourage non-disruptive behavior in tourists, and that the decline in penguin numbers is caused by other factors.\\nAmanda Nimon of the Scott Polar Research Institute spent three southern hemisphere summers at Cuverville Island in Antarctica studying penguin behavior towards humans.  \\"A nesting penguin will react very differently to a person rapidly and closely approaching the nest,\\" says Nimon.  \\"First they exhibit large and prolonged heart rate changes and then they often flee the nest leaving it open for predators   to fly in and remove eggs or chicks.\\"  The artificial egg, specially for the project, monitored both the parent who had been 'disturbed' when the egg was placed in the nest and the other parent as they both took it in turns to guard the nest.\\nHowever, Boris Culik, who monitored the Adelie penguins, believes that Nimon's findings do not invalidate his own research.

The Patriots struggling offensive line combined with Brady's accuracy issues doomed them against Tamba Hali and Justin Houston while the Patriots had no answer for the Chiefs balanced offensive attack. The Chiefs had a strong opening possession, reaching the Patriots 46, but were forced to punt. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Chiefs struck with 11-play, 73-yard drive, with Jamaal Charles scoring on a 2-yard touchdown run. The Patriots managed to reach the Chiefs 42-yard line on their next drive but were once again forced to punt. On the Chiefs' next possession, Knile Davis powered his way for a 48-yard carry to the Patriots 38-yard line. Next, Alex Smith hit star tight-end Travis Kelce on a 33-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots 5-yard line. Finally, Smith hit Charles for a five-yard touchdown pass, extending the Chiefs lead to 14-0. The Patriots once again drove into Chiefs' territory on their next drive, but again punted away. Later, the Chiefs drove all the way to the Patriots 4-yard line, and Smith hit Dwayne Bowe at the Patriots 1-yard line, which should have ended the half, but Logan Ryan was called for a hands-to-the face on Donnie Avery, allowing one more play, and Cairo Santos booted a 22-yard chip-shot field goal for a 17-0 Chiefs lead at halftime. The Chiefs had gained 303 yards of offense in the first half, the most allowed in one half by the Patriots under Belichick. Both teams punted on their initial second-half possession, but on 2nd and 7 on the Patriots' next possession, Tamba Hali, almost completely untouched by left tackle Nate Solder, strip-sacked Brady and recovered for Kansas City at the Patriots 9. Two plays later, Smith threw a quick pass to Charles out of the backfield for a touchdown, Charles' third, increasing Kansas City's lead to 24-0. On the Patriots' second play of their next drive, a miscommunication between Brady and Edelman led to an interception by Sean Smith who returned the ball 34 yards to the New England 13 yard line. The Patriots defense managed to keep Kansas City out of the end zone, but Santos booted a 31-yard field goal, giving Kansas City a 27-0 lead. On the Patriots next drive, Vereen ran for 9 yards on 1st down. After being stuffed for no gain on the next play, Brady hit Vereen for a 28-yard gain to the Chiefs 44. On the very next play, Brady hit Brandon LaFell who broke through three defenders and raced off for a 44-yard touchdown, making the score 27-7. However, the Chiefs couldn't be stopped. Kansas City answered right back, marching 80 yards in 12 plays, converting two third-and-longs in the process, and scoring on Smith's two-yard touchdown strike to Kelce extending the lead to 34-7, and killing any hope of a Patriots comeback. On the ensuing Patriots drive, facing a 3rd-and-4 from their own 26, Husain Abdullah intercepted a Brady pass and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving the Chiefs a 41-7 lead. Abdullah fell to his knees in a Muslim prayer, and was flagged for unnecessary roughness. This caused controversy as many thought it was for his praying. With the deficit an insurmountable 41-7, Brady was benched and rookie Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in. Garoppolo completed 3 passes on the drive: a 5-yard pass to Edelman, a 37-yard screen to LaFell, then a 13-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, for a 41-14 score. After both teams punted, the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock to end the game. Jamaal Charles was the main weapon of the Chiefs' offense, totaling 108 yards from scrimmage (92 rushing, 16 receiving) and three touchdowns. Knile Davis ran the ball 16 times for 107 yards. Alex Smith was 20/26 for 236 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. The Chiefs forced three turnovers and converted them into 17 points while committing no turnovers themselves. Brady completed 14 of 23 passes for a pedestrian 159 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions while being sacked 3 times. Brandon LaFell was the sole offensive star for the Patriots, catching 6 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown.  The 27 point margin of defeat represented the second largest loss for the Patriots in the Bill Belichick era (the Patriots' worst loss was a 31-point loss (31-0) to the Bills in Week 1 of the 2003 season). With the loss, the Patriots' record dropped to 2-2. In his regular press conference the ensuing Wednesday, when asked about the loss (primarily by Albert Breer) he replied with his now famous line, \\"We're on to Cincinnati\\". The Patriots would proceed to win ten of their final twelve regular season games, clinch the #1 seed, win the AFC Championship, and win the Super Bowl, making that quote a piece of Patriots lore. Following their Super Bowl victory over the Seahawks, several Patriots players, including Brady himself, pointed to this game as the turning point in the Patriots season.\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: How many yards was the second longest field goal?","target":"22","rationale":"The longest field goal in the given passage is a 31-yarder.

After rescuing the EU officials and destroying the cyborgs, ESWAT return to Olympus, where Briareos is confined to hospital until he recovers, while Deunan continues ESWAT work. When Deunan's commanding officer Lance introduces her to her new partner, Tereus, she is shocked as her partner resembles Briareos' human form.Deunan confronts Lance for an explanation, and is given the tour of the new Bioroid production facility. During the tour, Hitomi, a bioroid that Deunan befriended during those events, is mentioned to now be a minister of political affairs. Here it is shown that Tereus is actually a Bioroid; a prototype for a whole new production line of Bioroids to be soldiers without negative emotions to impact their judgment in fighting. As his physical and mental strength was found to be most desirable in ESWAT, Briareos' DNA was used mostly in Tereus' design.

Because many of these cyborgs consist of parts made by Poseidon, a multinational industrial conglomerate, an emissary is sent to Prime Minister Athena.
