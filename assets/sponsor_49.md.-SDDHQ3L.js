Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or \\"desensitization\\" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine.","target":"Expression of fibrinogen receptors during activation and subsequent desensitization of human platelets by epinephrine","rationale":"The focus of the paper is to examine the effect of epinephrine on fibrinogen receptors and platelet aggregation.

He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.\\nBach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV...","target":"Johann Samuel Drese","rationale":"The first sentence in the article mentions Johann Sebastian Bach and his work as an organist for Mühlhausen. The second paragraph then goes on to detail some of his major works, such as Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. It is clear from the context that this question relates to a time before Bach's death so it can be eliminated from consideration.\\nNext, we are told that Johann Samuel Drese died at some point during 1716 (the exact date isn't given). This indicates that he was alive at least until 31 December 1715 which makes him clearly older than Bach as shown by other records showing Bach's birth year being 1685 meaning Drese would have had to been born no later than 1684 if he were to die within 1 year after turning"},{"source":"Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

Most of the time, I live on campus but as next week is Spring Break, I came home to my parents' tonight. My brother (21) is home and his girlfriend is staying the night, as tomorrow they plan to leave early and go to Boston. I assumed that the girlfriend would get my room, my brother would sleep in his and that I would sleep on the couch. \\n\\nTurns out, I was wrong. My brother somehow convinced my mom that they should share a room. (My parents are very conservative Christians so I didn't think they'd go for it). Now, my brother's bed isn't big enough for them to sleep in together but my bed is. So, my mom told them it'd be okay to sleep in my bed. Without asking me first. I only found out when my dad came to collect me from school, as he thought I knew. He understood why I wasn't comfortable with it. I talked to my mom and was told that she would wash the sheets in the morning. Fine. Whatever. I accept I'm not going to have a say in this and don't want to fight.\\n\\nMy brother and his girlfriend come home. I pull my brother aside and tell him that I don't want them doing anything in my bed tonight. My brother got really mad and ignored me for the rest of the night. He made a snarky comment when he went upstairs and my mom asked me what was wrong with us. I told her and she got mad that I said that. I told her I'm not going to apologize for saying it. I also said it was messed up for her okaying this when it was my bed, without asking me first. She said there was no other option and I said that's not true, there definitely was and brought up me sleeping on the couch.\\n\\nAfter they went to bed, my brother came back down to grab his charger and was still in a mood, mumbling about how everything is a problem. My mom said it wasn't and that I shouldn't have said it. I said I don't regret saying it. Brother said I was mad at him, I said that wasn't true, I simply asked him to not do something. He said \\"Whatever, she'll never stay the night again.\\" Which isn't at all what I said or even wanted.

This study investigates A20 expression in human glioma tissues and four glioma cell lines, and its effect on tumorigenesis of glioma cells and a mouse tumor model.   \\n METHODS Human glioma tissue samples and cells were subject to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Glioma cells was tested by flow cytometry. A xenograft tumor model in mice was utilized to examine the knock-down effect of specific A20 siRNAs on tumorigenesis.   \\n RESULTS A20 was overexpressed in clinical glioma tissue samples (63.9%) and correlated with clinical staging. All four human glioma cell lines expressed A20, among which U87 displayed the strongest expression signals. Inhibiting A20 expression by siRNAs in vitro reduced the growth rates of glioma cells and resulted in G1/S arrest and increased apoptosis. In a mouse tumor model, local administration of siRNA significantly suppressed solid tumor growth.   \\n CONCLUSIONS A20 was overexpressed both in human glioma tissues and cell lines, and inhibiting A20 expression greatly slowed tumor cell growth in culture and in mice. These findings indicated that A20 is involved in tumorigenesis of human glioma, and may serve as a future therapeutic target.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the objective of the study (\\"OBJECTIVE A20 is a TNF-inducible primary response gene, which has been found to have antiapoptotic function in several cancer cells.

Follicles are freed from the surrounding connective tissue by shearing, which is effected by repeated cutting with a loosely fitting pair of scissors, and collected individually under liquid using gentle aspiration. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that the follicles are sheared away from the surrounding dermis in the region of the connective tissue capsule which encircles the hair. The follicles appear viable by light and electron microscopy and, within 2 h of isolation, retain the capacity to incorporate [3H]thymidine into DNA and [35S]methionine into proteins as judged by autoradiography. A histologic comparison indicates that the structural integrity of follicles isolated by this new method is significantly superior to those plucked from the animal at the same time. The method affords the isolation of large numbers of hair follicles, without resort to enzyme treatments, suitable for biologic studies in the absence of other skin appendages and dermis.","target":"Animal","rationale":"The paper focuses on a new method to isolate large numbers of viable hair follicles from the rat skin.

Passage:An avid sportsman, Pierre Lorillard and his brother, George Lyndes Lorillard, were both major figures in Thoroughbred horse racing. In 1874, Pierre's horse, Saxon, won the Belmont Stakes. Although his horse Parole finished fourth in the 1876 Kentucky Derby, it went on to race with considerable success both in the United States and in Europe. In the 19th century, shipping horses from New York to Louisville, Kentucky was a major undertaking and as the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes were both held in the New York City area in the period, neither of the Lorillard brothers entered horses again in the Kentucky Derby. Pierre Lorillard established Rancocas Stable, named for the New Jersey town where he owned a country house. He spent time in Paris and in England where, in 1881, his horse Iroquois became the first American-owned and bred horse to win a European classic race. Ridden by the champion English jockey Fred Archer, Iroquois won The Derby and then went on to capture the St. Leger Stakes as well.

Passage:The division arrived in Liverpool on April 17 and began training in amphibious operations. After training in the United Kingdom from 17 April 1944, the 79th Infantry Division landed on Utah Beach, Normandy, 12–14 June and entered combat 19 June 1944, with an attack on the high ground west and northwest of Valognes and high ground south of Cherbourg. The division took Fort du Roule after a heavy engagement and entered Cherbourg, 25 June. It was around this time that Corporal John D. Kelly and First Lieutenant Carlos C. Ogden, both of the 314th Infantry Regiment, were awarded the Medal of Honor. It held a defensive line at the Ollonde River until 2 July 1944 and then returned to the offensive, taking La Haye du Puits in house-to-house fighting, 8 July. On 26 July, the 79th attacked across the Ay River, took Lessay, crossed the Sarthe River and entered Le Mans, 8 August, meeting only light resistance. The advance continued across the Seine, 19 August. Heavy German counterattacks were repelled, 22–27 August, and the division reached the Therain River, 31 August. Moving swiftly to the Franco-Belgian frontier near St. Amand (east of Lille), the division was then moved to XV Corps in eastern France, where it encountered heavy resistance in taking Charmes in street fighting, 12 September. The 79th cut across the Moselle and Meurthe Rivers, 13–23 September, cleared the Forêt de Parroy in a severe engagement, 28 September–9 October, and attacked to gain high ground east of Emberménil, 14–23 October, when it was relieved, 24 October.","target":"b","rationale":"The question asks for the date that the division landed on Utah Beach, but there is no information in the passage that could be used to answer the question."},{"source":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: \\n\\nFerns are the most common seedless vascular plants ( Figure below ).

Measurements of serum electrolytes, as well as divalent cations and the anionic contributions of serum proteins, lactate, phosphate, and serum creatinine, were made at the time of admission, after rehydration, and during convalescence. At the time of admission, the mean serum concentration of sodium was 134.8 mmol (meq) per liter, that of chloride was 103.2 mmol per liter, and that of bicarbonate was 11.4 mmol per liter; the mean anion gap was 20.2 mmol per liter. The mean serum creatinine concentration was 2.48 mg per deciliter. The low serum bicarbonate level and the high serum anion gap were corrected by rehydration. The increased serum anion gap was caused by hyperproteinemia, lactic acidemia, and hyperphosphatemia, with anionic contributions to the rise in anion gap estimated as protein, 5.5 meq per liter; lactate, 2.5 meq per liter; and phosphate, 2.5 meq per liter. The hyperproteinemia was attributed to dehydration, the lactic acidemia to shock, and the hyperphosphatemia to acidosis and transient renal failure. The mean concentrations of serum calcium and magnesium were slightly elevated but did not affect the increased anion gap. These results indicate that severe cholera causes acidosis with relatively little change in serum chloride but an increased serum anion gap. The acidosis is more profound than would be expected on the basis of stool losses of bicarbonate, because of superimposed lactic acidemia and renal failure. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data about measurements of serum electrolytes, divalent cations and the anionic contributions of serum proteins, lactate, phosphate, and serum creatinine in patients with V. cholerae infection.

He had a sister, Eleanor. Both of his parents, and several aunts and uncles, played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner.\\n\\nTimmons moved to New York in 1954. He played with Kenny Dorham in 1956, making his recording debut with the trumpeter in a live set in May of that year. He went on to play and record with Chet Baker in 1956-57 (bassist Scott LaFaro was part of this band for a time), Sonny Stitt in 1957, and Maynard Ferguson in 1957-58. He also recorded as a sideman with hornmen Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Lee Morgan, all for Blue Note Records in 1957.  Timmons became best known as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, including for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that \\"He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky - he could play a lot of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor.\\" By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.  Timmons was also known as a composer during this period: The Encyclopedia of Jazz states that his compositions \\"Moanin'\\" (from the 1958 album of the same title), \\"This Here\\", and \\"Dat Dere\\" \\"helped generate the gospel-tinged 'soul jazz' style of [the] late '50s and early '60s.\\" The first was written when Timmons was first with Blakey; the others were composed when he was with Adderley. \\"This Here\\" (sometimes \\"Dis Here\\") was a surprise commercial success for Adderley: recorded in concert in 1959, it was released as part of The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco album while the band was still on tour, and they discovered its popularity only when they arrived back in New York and found crowds outside the Village Gate, where they were due to play.  Timmons was reported to be dissatisfied with the money he had received from \\"This Here\\", and was enticed in February 1960 into leaving Adderley and returning to Blakey's band by the offer of more pay. Timmons then appeared on further well-known albums with the drummer, including A Night in Tunisia, The Freedom Rider and The Witch Doctor. His own recording debut as sole leader was This Here Is Bobby Timmons in 1960, which contained his first versions of his best-known compositions. In the same year, he played on recordings led by Nat Adderley, Arnett Cobb, and Johnny Griffin, among others; on the first of these, Work Song, Timmons did not appear on all of the tracks, because he had been drinking heavily.\\n\\nWhat year did he move","target":"1954.","rationale":"The context clearly states that he moved to New York in 1954."},{"source":"In this task, you are given an answer, and your task is to generate a reasonable question for that answer.\\n\\nIt's a good way to get to know different cultures.","target":"Do you read any international books?","rationale":"The answer is a statement about the benefits of reading international books.

Given that this individual struggles with emotions and showing them in particular, we can assume that it would be difficult for them to adjust their behavior significantly just because of one person's preference for physical affection.

The answer option \\"On 20 May 2012 he died from liver cancer at age 62\\" provides incorrect information since it mentions two different diseases-pneumonia and liver cancer.

These compounds inhibited viral glycoprotein interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Based on this property, we evaluated their antiviral efficacy against several different viruses known to employ GAGs for host cell entry. Results: Extensive analysis of the tannins' mechanism of action was performed on a panel of viruses during the attachment and entry steps of infection. Virus-specific binding assays and the analysis of viral spread during treatment with these compounds were also conducted. CHLA and PUG were effective in abrogating infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), measles virus (MV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), at μM concentrations and in dose-dependent manners without significant cytotoxicity. Moreover, the natural compounds inhibited viral attachment, penetration, and spread, to different degrees for each virus. Specifically, the tannins blocked all these steps of infection for HCMV, HCV, and MV, but had little effect on the post-fusion spread of DENV and RSV, which could suggest intriguing differences in the roles of GAGinteractions for these viruses. Conclusions: CHLA and PUG may be of value as broad-spectrum antivirals for limiting emerging/recurring viruses known to engage host cell GAGs for entry. Further studies testing the efficacy of these tannins in vivo against certain viruses are justified. \\n Title: Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of chebulagic acid and punicalagin against viruses that use glycosaminoglycans for entry","target":"False","rationale":"The paragraph provides an analysis of the antiviral efficacy of chebulagic acid (CHLA) and punicalagin (PUG) against several different viruses.

Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries.

In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War).

Other parties represented included the Ukrainian Radical Party and the Christian Social Party.\\n\\n- The Second Polish Republic, also known as the Second Commonwealth of Poland or interwar Poland, refers to the country of Poland between the First and Second World Wars (19181939). Officially known as the Republic of Poland or the Commonwealth of Poland, the Polish state was recreated in 1918, in the aftermath of World War I. When, after several regional conflicts, the borders of the state were fixed in 1922, Poland's neighbours were Czechoslovakia, Germany, the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and the Soviet Union. It had access to the Baltic Sea via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of Gdynia. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. Despite internal and external pressures, it continued to exist until 1939, when Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Slovak Republic, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. The Second Republic was significantly different in territory to the current Polish state. It included substantially more territory in the east and less in the west.\\n\\n- Daniel of Galicia (1201  1264; : \\"Danylo Romanovych (Halytskyi)\\"; : \\"Daniil Romanovich (Galitsky)\\") was a King of Rus', Prince (Knyaz) of Galicia (\\"Halych\\") (12051255), Peremyshl (1211), and Volodymyr (12121231).

This inadequacy stands out in stark contrast to more traditional computer science domains, such as computer vision (CV), and natural language processing (NLP).   For physiological signals, learning feature embeddings is a natural solution to data insufficiency caused by patient privacy concerns -- rather than share data, researchers may share informative embedding models (i.e., representation models), which map patient data to an output embedding.    Here, we present the PHASE (PHysiologicAl Signal Embeddings) framework, which consists of three components: i) learning neural network embeddings of physiological signals, ii) predicting outcomes based on the learned embedding, and iii) interpreting the prediction results by estimating feature attributions in the \\"stacked\\" models (i.e., feature embedding model followed by prediction model).   PHASE is novel in three ways: 1) To our knowledge, PHASE is the first instance of transferal of neural networks to create physiological signal embeddings. 2) We present a tractable method to obtain feature attributions through stacked models.   We prove that our stacked model attributions can approximate Shapley values -- attributions known to have desirable properties -- for arbitrary sets of models. 3) PHASE was extensively tested in a cross-hospital setting including publicly available data.   In our experiments, we show that PHASE significantly outperforms alternative embeddings -- such as raw, exponential moving average/variance, and autoencoder -- currently in use. Furthermore, we provide evidence that transferring neural network embedding/representation learners between distinct hospitals still yields performant embeddings and offer recommendations when transference is ineffective.","target":"Physiological signal embeddings for prediction performance and hospital transference with a general Shapley value interpretability method for stacked models","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nPhysiological signal embeddings for prediction performance and hospital transference with a general Shapley value interpretability method for stacked models."},{"source":"Pick the most correct option to answer the following question.\\n\\nWhich of the following would most likely happen if grasses and shrubs were removed from a rural Massachusetts ecosystem?\\n\\nOptions:\\n\\n- A: There would be an increase in consumers in the ecosystem.\\n\\n- B: There would be an increase of photosynthesis in the ecosystem.\\n\\n- C: There would be a decrease in food energy produced by the ecosystem.\\n\\n- D: There would be a decrease of carbon dioxide available to the ecosystem.","target":"C","rationale":"The first step to answering this question is to understand the terms “grasses” and “shrubs.” Grasses refer to plants that are green, have long leaves with parallel veins (like blades of grass), grow close together in bunches and spread out by runners.

His mother was a housewife, and his father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, a police constable, He was named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad after Chhatrapati Shivaji, a Maratha warrior King, and was brought up speaking Marathi at home and Kannada outside. Rajinikanth's ancestors hailed from Mavadi Kadepathar, Maharashtra and Nachikuppam, Tamil Nadu. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers (Satyanarayana Rao and Nageshwara Rao) and a sister (Aswath Balubhai).\\n\\nIn January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in Rana, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time. During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion. He was treated at St. Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged. Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit. Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating. Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment. It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush.  On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs signal, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011.  Despite several failed attempts to restart Rana upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his Enthiran character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film Ra.One (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. In November 2011, it was decided that Rana would be shelved in favour of a new project with Rajinikanth, titled Kochadaiiyaan. The motion capture film, which is the first of its kind in India, was released in 2014 to positive reviews. Kochadaiiyaan, and the 3D release of Sivaji in 2012, made Rajinikanth the first Indian actor to have appeared in four different forms of world cinema: black-and-white, colour, 3D and motion capture. Following the completion of Kochadaiiyaan, Rajinikanth began work in Ravikumar's next directorial venture, titled Lingaa alongside Anushka Shetty and Sonakshi Sinha. The film was released on 12 December 2014, coinciding with his birthday, and received mixed reviews from critics. Rajinikanth's next film was director Pa. Ranjith's crime drama Kabali, produced by S. Thanu. The film was released in July 2016. Rajinikanth is filming for 2.0, a spiritual successor to Enthiran, that is scheduled for release in 2017.

Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond. Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. Zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms that sink to the bottom. Nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 44.24) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water. As a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the algae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are found across the globe. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.\\n\\n\\nQ: At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in what zone break down dead organisms that sink there?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"aphotic zone","rationale":"Aphotic zone is the part of a lake, ocean or other body of water where there is little or no light. The aphotic zone can be further divided into two parts:\\n- The uppermost portion (also known as the disphotic zone) extends from the base of the photic zone to around 1000 meters below sea level. It may also be referred to as \\"twilight\\" since it receives only enough sunlight for dim silhouettes and shapes to become visible in certain conditions; however, most objects are not distinguishable with clarity at this depth range.\\n- In deeper waters (below 1000 m), sunlight does not reach at all, so photosynthesis cannot occur here.

This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony.

Mumtaz Mahal was born Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra to a family of Persian nobility.\\n\\nUpon his accession to the throne in 1628, Shah Jahan designated Mumtaz as his chief empress with the title of 'Malika-i-Jahan' (\\"Queen of the World\\") and 'Malika-uz-Zamani' (\\"Queen of the Age\\"). Mumtaz's tenure as empress was brief (spanning a period of only three years due to her untimely death), nonetheless Shah Jahan bestowed her with luxuries that no other empress was given before her. For example, no other empress' residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra Fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own. Each wife of the Mughal emperor was given regular monthly allowance for her gastos (housekeeping or travelling expenses). The highest allowance on record is 10 lakh rupees per year given to Mumtaz Mahal under Shah Jahan.  Shah Jahan consulted Mumtaz in both private matters and the affairs of the state and she served as his close confidante and trusted adviser. At her intercession, he forgave enemies or commuted death sentences. His trust in her was so great that he gave her the highest honour of the land -- his imperial seal, the Mehr Uzaz, which validated imperial decrees. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power, in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded considerable influence in the previous reign.  A great influence on him, often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. Mumtaz also patronized a number of poets, scholars and other talented persons. A noted Sanskrit poet, Vansidhara Mishra, was the Empress' favourite. On the recommendation of her principal lady-in-waiting, Sati-un-Nissa, Mumtaz Mahal provided pensions and donations to the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra, which is now known as Zahara Bagh.

It was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for four centuries and is today renowned for its tranquility and natural beauty. It is a popular tourist destination and a place for retreats. Its modern Gaelic name means \\"Iona of (Saint) Columba\\" (formerly anglicised \\"Icolmkill\\").\\n\\n- The Holy Island of Lindisfarne is a tidal island off the northeast coast of England. It is also known just as Holy Island. It constitutes the civil parish of Holy Island in Northumberland. Holy Island has a recorded history from the 6th century AD. It was an important centre of Celtic Christianity under Saints Aidan of Lindisfarne, Cuthbert, Eadfrith of Lindisfarne and Eadberht of Lindisfarne. After the Viking invasions and the Norman conquest of England, a priory was reestablished. A small castle was built on the island in 1550.\\n\\n- Celtic Christianity or Insular Christianity refers broadly to certain features of Christianity that were common, or held to be common, across the Celtic-speaking world during the Early Middle Ages. \\"Celtic Christianity\\" has been conceived of with differing levels of specificity: some writers have described a distinct \\"Celtic Church\\" uniting the Celtic peoples and distinguishing them from the \\"Roman\\" Catholic Church, while others classify it as simply a set of distinctive practices occurring in those areas. Scholars now reject the former notion, but note that there were certain traditions and practices used in both the Irish and British churches but not in the wider Christian world. These include a distinctive system for determining the dating of Easter, a style of monastic tonsure, a unique system of penance, and the popularity of going into \\"exile for Christ\\". Additionally, there were other practices that developed in certain parts of Britain or Ireland, but which are not known to have spread beyond a particular region. The term therefore denotes regional practices among the insular churches and their associates, rather than actual theological differences.\\n\\n- Saint Cuthbert (c. 634  20 March 687) was a saint of the early Northumbrian church in the Celtic tradition. He was a monk, bishop and hermit, associated with the monasteries of Melrose and Lindisfarne in what might loosely be termed the Kingdom of Northumbria in the North East of England. and the South East of Scotland. After his death he became one of the most important medieval saints of Northern England, with a cult centred on his tomb at Durham Cathedral. Cuthbert is regarded as the patron saint of northern England. His feast days are 20 March and 4 September (translation).\\n\\n- Eadberht of Lindisfarne (died 6 May 698), also known as Saint Eadberht, was Bishop of Lindisfarne, England, from 688 until 698. He is notable as having founded the holy shrine to his predecessor Saint Cuthbert on the island of Lindisfarne, a place that was to become a centre of great pilgrimage in later years.\\n\\n- Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.\\n\\n- The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).\\n\\n- The Norman conquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later styled as William the Conqueror.\\n\\n- Finan of Lindisfarne ( died 17 February 661 ) , also known as Saint Finan , was an Irish monk , trained at Iona in Scotland , who became the second Bishop of Lindisfarne from 651 until 661 .\\n\\n- Saint Columba ('church dove'; 7 December 521  9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.\\n\\n- Eadfrith of Lindisfarne (died 721), also known as Saint Eadfrith, was Bishop of Lindisfarne, probably from 698 onwards. By the twelfth century it was believed that Eadfrith succeeded Eadberht and nothing in the surviving records contradicts this belief. Lindisfarne was among the main religious sites of the kingdom of Northumbria in the early eighth century, the resting place of Saints Aidan and Cuthbert. He is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, and Anglican Communion.\\n\\n- Northumberland is a county in North East England. The northernmost county of England, it borders Cumbria to the west, County Durham and Tyne and Wear to the south and Scotland to the north. To the east is the North Sea coastline with a long distance path. The county town is Alnwick although the county council is in Morpeth (for the moment, as there are plans to move it to nearby Ashington). The northernmost point of Northumberland and England is at Marshall Meadows Bay.\\n\\n- The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples.

Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about $30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about $1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nAnn decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift.

The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".\\n\\n- Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.\\n\\n- Well of Shiuan is a 1978 science fiction novel written by C. J. Cherryh . It is the second of four books composing the Morgaine Stories , chronicling the deeds of Morgaine , a woman obsessed with a mission of the utmost importance , and her warrior companion , Nhi Vanye i Chya .\\n\\n- Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\\n\\n- DAW Books is an American science fiction and fantasy publisher, founded by Donald A. Wollheim following his departure from Ace Books in 1971. The company therefore claims to be \\"the first publishing company ever devoted exclusively to science fiction and fantasy.\\" The first DAW Book published was the 1972 short story collection \\"Spell of the Witch World\\" by Andre Norton.\\n\\n- Downbelow Station is a science fiction novel written by C. J. Cherryh and published in 1981 by DAW Books. It won the Hugo Award in 1982, was shortlisted for a Locus Award that same year, and was named by \\"Locus\\" magazine as one of the top 50 science fiction novels of all time in 1987.\\n\\n- The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Carolyn Janice Cherry (born September 1, 1942), better known by the pen name C. J. Cherryh, is an American writer of speculative fiction. She has written more than 60 books since the mid-1970s, including the Hugo Award-winning novels \\"Downbelow Station\\" (1981) and \\"Cyteen\\" (1988), both set in her Alliance-Union universe.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'well of shiuan' and 'daw books'?","target":"publisher","rationale":"Well of Shiuan is a 1978 science fiction novel written by C.

Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters.

Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament.

Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.St Botolph's Aldersgate remains open as a functioning church. Unusually for an English church, because of its location in a now mainly commercial area with few local residents, services are held on Tuesdays instead of the more traditional Sundays. On 4 January 1950, St Botolph's Aldersgate and the surviving ruins of Christ Church Greyfriars were both designated Grade I listed buildings.In 1934, a statue of Sir Robert Peel erected in Cheapside in 1855 was declared an obstruction to traffic and removed.

Passage 1:While 1776 had started well for the American cause with the evacuation of British troops from Boston in March, the defense of New York City had gone quite poorly. British general William Howe had landed troops on Long Island in August and had pushed George Washington's Continental Army completely out of New York by mid-November, when he captured the remaining troops on Manhattan. The main British troops returned to New York for the winter season. They left mainly Hessian troops in New Jersey. These troops were under the command of Colonel Rall and Colonel Von Donop. They were ordered to small outposts in and around Trenton. Howe then sent troops under the command of Charles Cornwallis across the Hudson River into New Jersey and chased Washington across New Jersey. Washington's army was shrinking, due to expiring enlistments and desertions, and suffered from poor morale, due to the defeats in the New York area. Most of Washington's army crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania north of Trenton, New Jersey, and destroyed or moved to the western shore all boats for miles in both directions. Cornwallis (under Howe's command), rather than attempting to immediately chase Washington further, established a chain of outposts from New Brunswick to Burlington, including one at Bordentown and one at Trenton, and ordered his troops into winter quarters. The British were happy to end the campaign season when they were ordered to winter quarters. This was a time for the generals to regroup, re-supply, and strategize for the upcoming campaign season the following spring.\\n Passage 2:Born in Greenwich, London, Craig came through the youth ranks at Millwall. Adept as a central defender or a left back, he received his maiden call into the first team squad for a First Division league match against Bradford City on 5 April 2003 and was an unused substitute during the 1–0 win. Craig made his professional debut with a starting appearance in a 3–3 draw with Nottingham Forest on 26 April 2003 and lasted 67 minutes before being substituted for Robbie Ryan. He started in the final game of the 2002–03 season at home to Coventry City and scored the first senior goal of his career in the 2–0 win, with the opener on 51 minutes. Craig began the 2003–04 season as a virtual ever-present, making 10 appearances, but he dropped out of the squad entirely in October 2003. He was again out of favour with manager Dennis Wise during the 2004–05 season and had to wait until 19 February 2005 for his first appearance, which came with a start in a 1–0 defeat to Stoke City and he finished the campaign with 10 appearances.\\n Passage 3:Maryland Route 12 (MD 12) is a state highway on the Eastern Shore in the U.S. state of Maryland. The route runs from the Virginia border south of Stockton, Worcester County, where it continues into Virginia as State Route 679 (SR 679), north to Main Street in the city of Salisbury in Wicomico County. The route is known as Snow Hill Road for most of its length and passes mostly through areas of woods and farms as well as the communities of Stockton, Girdletree, and Snow Hill. MD 12 intersects several roads including MD 366 in Stockton, U.S. Route 113 (US 113) and US 113 Business (US 113 Bus.) in Snow Hill, MD 354 in Indiantown, and US 13 near Salisbury. Portions of MD 12 near Snow Hill and Stockton existed as unnumbered state roads by 1910. When the first state highways in Maryland were designated by 1927, MD 12 was assigned to run from Stockton north to Salisbury.

New Hampshire has offered diploma privilege to students that attend the state's only law school since 2005 and the state of Iowa considered reinstating diploma privilege in 2014. Originally used as a method to foster the growth of formal legal education, the privilege started to fall into disuse early in the 20th century, in common with the tightening of requirements in other learned professions.

Cruella's probation officer, Chloe Simon, nevertheless suspects her, partly because Chloe is the owner of the now-adult Dipstick (one of the original 15 puppies from the previous film) who moved from Roger and Anita's house to her house.\\nDipstick's mate, Dottie, has recently given birth to three puppies: Domino, Little Dipper and Oddball (who lacks spots). To mend her reputation, Cruella buys the Second Chance Dog shelter, owned by Kevin Shepherd, to resolve its financial insolvency that is on the verge of eviction. Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy's subjects are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their original states but conceals this discovery. Inevitably, when Big Ben rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality and enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal 102 Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood, specifically modifying the original design to use Dipstick's children.\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the first name of the person whose custody Cruella is released to?","target":"Chloe","rationale":"The context says that Cruella is released into the custody of Chloe Simon.

His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada, was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place.

Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070 that Olaf was killed in an ambush, and so did Florence of Worcester in 1100. Those are the only contemporary sources that mention the death of the king. After the king's canonization it was felt that the saint could not have died in such circumstances.

Eastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria in 1885 through bloodless revolution. During the early 1890s, two pro-Bulgarian revolutionary organizations active in Macedonia and Southern Thrace were founded: the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees and the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee.

In 1903 they participated together with the Thracian Bulgarians in the unsuccessful Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilajet. That was followed by series of conflicts between Greeks and Bulgarians into both regions. The tension were result of the  different concepts of nationality. The Slavic villages became divided into followers of the Bulgarian national movement and so-called grecomans.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin.

But thousands of protesters, alleging electoral fraud, surrounded government buildings, camping in the snow and waving orange flags. Eventually, Putin's Ukrainian allies capitulated. The Supreme Court called another round of voting, and voters dumped Yanukovych in favor of a politician, Viktor Yushchenko, who called for Ukraine's rapid admission to NATO. Putin was left spluttering. But he waited. In the winters of 2006 and 2009, gas supplies from the Russian company Gazprom were temporarily halted over payment disputes, but these were quickly resolved.

Babies born on or before 36 weeks 6 days are consider preterm or premature. Babies born between 37 weeks and 38 weeks 6 days are considered early term. Babies born between 39 weeks and 40 weeks 6 days are considered full term. 12 Weeks Pregnant Baby: All parts of your baby are developing, from tooth buds to toenails. Your baby will keep developing and getting larger and stronger for the rest of your pregnancy. On average, pregnancies lasted 38 weeks from the day of conception to the day the baby was born, or about 40 to 41 weeks from the day of the women's last menstrual period. (The latter measure is more commonly used to determine a woman's due date.) Your doctor will ask for your medical history which includes: 1  Medical problems. 2  The date of your last menstrual period. 3  Birth control methods. 4  History of abortions and/or miscarriages. 5  Hospitalizations. 6  Medications you are taking and medication allergies. 7  Your family’s medical history. 12 Weeks Pregnant. Baby: All parts of your baby are developing, from tooth buds to toenails. Your baby will keep developing and getting larger and stronger for the rest of your pregnancy. By the end of this week, the chance of miscarriage drops considerably. Mom-to-be: You'll feel more energetic for the next few weeks. Pregnancy can be broken down into days, weeks, months and trimesters. Day 1 marks the beginning of week 1 of pregnancy, month 1 of pregnancy, and the start of the first trimester. A baby is conceived during week 3 of pregnancy. Day 15 marks the beginning of the week 3. The average pregnancy is 280 days long. Another way to talk about the days and weeks of pregnancy is to combine the two units of measurement. Week 1 of pregnancy begins on 0 weeks 1 day and ends on 1 week 0 days of pregnancy. Week 2 of pregnancy encompasses the time between 1 week 1 day and 2 weeks 0 days of pregnancy. Tip of the Week: Eat plenty of foods that contain calcium, such as cheeses, sardines, and broccoli. Your baby needs it, and so do you. 10 Weeks Pregnant. Baby: Your baby is still small but looks and acts like a baby. Arms and legs are longer and can bend at the elbows and knees. But even after excluding babies who were born preterm, the length of pregnancy ranged from about 35 to 40 weeks from the day of conception to the day of birth (or about 38 to 43 weeks from the day of a woman's last menstrual period.) [See Are Firstborns More Likely to Be Late?] How long a healthy pregnancy lasts can vary by as much as five weeks, even when doctors precisely determined the date of conception, a new study suggests. Although the length of a healthy pregnancy is known to be variable, some of this variation was thought to be due to errors in determining the age of the baby, the researchers said. Tip of the Week: Start shopping for maternity bras. You'll need one pretty soon. You can go ahead and get nursing bras if you're planning to breastfeed. 11 Weeks Pregnant. Baby: It's another big growth week. When your doctor uses a Doppler stethoscope now, she can hear the rapid swooshing noises of the heartbeat.

To compensate for this, we tested a new simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) acquisition for accelerated rs-EPI.', 'After approval by the local ethics committee, eight healthy female volunteers (age, 38.9 ± 13.1 years) underwent breast MRI at 3T. Conventional as well as two-fold (2× SMS) and three-fold (3× SMS) slice-accelerated rs-EPI sequences were acquired at b-values of 50 and 800 s/mm(2). Two independent readers analyzed the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in fibroglandular breast parenchyma. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was estimated based on the subtraction method. ADC and SNR were compared between sequences by using the Friedman test.', 'The acquisition time was 4:21 min for conventional rs-EPI, 2:35 min for 2× SMS rs-EPI and 1:44 min for 3× SMS rs-EPI.

Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322.

I eat a snack before getting up, and then I quickly pack my sleeping bag, tent, and other things and get on the road. Usually I have less speed. Traveling by bike allows me to stop anywhere, such as lakes(especially places to swim), woods, and scenic spots .\\nSomewhere near lunch, I find a small drugstore and buy some bread, sandwich materials, and fruit. In the afternoon, my speeds are higher, and I spend less time at stops. In the late afternoon, I start thinking about stopping.

In contrast, by giving diners at her cafes options for paying their meals with volunteer work, overpaying and underpaying as well as allowing them to eat in a restaurant setting rather than in a cafeteria-style environment like most soup kitchens use gives customers more respect and helps maintain their dignity (by making them feel less like recipients of charity).\\nTherefore Yes"},{"source":"Because the universal acceptance of international laws which in 1948 defined and forbade genocide with the promulgation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG), those criminals who were prosecuted after the war in international courts for taking part in the Holocaust were found guilty of crimes against humanity and other more specific crimes like murder.

He is currently signed with WWE working in their Legends program. Waltman has won a dozen championships between WWE, WCW, and TNA; the majority were cruiserweight and tag team titles.\\n\\nAs The Lightning Kid, Waltman had his WWF tryout match in Phoenix, Arizona, the day after WrestleMania IX, against fellow hopeful Louie Spicolli (soon known as Rad Radford in the WWF). He reminisced that he was lucky to have an opponent with a vested interest in an impressive match, rather than (as was then typical) a disinterested WWF veteran jobber like Virgil or Jim Powers.  After earning a contract, he made his TV debut as The Kamikaze Kid on Monday Night Raw on May 3, losing to Doink the Clown. He quickly became The Cannonball Kid, then simply The Kid. He scored an upset pinfall on Razor Ramon on the May 17 episode of Monday Night Raw, thus becoming The 1-2-3 Kid. Razor challenged him to a rematch, wagering $10,000 of his own money. Kid accepted the challenge, but grabbed the money and ran from the arena during the match. Ted DiBiase, who was feuding with Razor, taunted him over losing to a nobody. This angered Kid, and led to a match in which he upset DiBiase as well. Razor turned face shortly after and took Kid under his wing. The 1-2-3 Kid made his pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam, losing to DiBiase's tag partner Irwin R. Schyster after Razor had defeated DiBiase. At Survivor Series, Kid was on Razor's team in a four-on-four elimination match. He and Marty Jannetty were the sole survivors, which led to them forming a tag team and holding the Tag Team Championship for a week in January 1994 after beating The Quebecers.  For the next two years, The 1-2-3 Kid was a natural underdog and fan favorite. He wrestled Bret Hart in an unusually long (for the time) and highly acclaimed match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in July 11, 1994 on Raw and had another brief (one-day) tag title reign in January 1995, with Bob Holly beating Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka at the 1995 Royal Rumble before losing to The Smoking Gunns on Raw.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Sean Waltman","rationale":"The text clearly mentions that Sean Waltman is an American professional wrestler.

POST : I (27m) was out to dinner with ex girlfriend (23f) and at the end of dinner we talked about possibly going back to my place for sex and to hang out and spend the night.

Our plan was for her to ask if she could stay over and go from there. A little more back story: we broke up about 6 weeks ago but started seeing each other again about 2 weeks ago because she wanted to have sex (and probably more) and I was on the same page.\\n\\nBack to our dinner on Friday night. As we're walking to my car, she tells me her host dad is very old school and how growing up he never interacted with girls much, but her mom \\"was a bitch\\" and had sex with a lot of guys. I asked her why she used the word bitch. And she said she didn't know, that I know what she means. I said, no I don't can you try to explain. And she aggressively told me she doesn't know how to explain and can I stop asking.\\n\\nAt this point, I started feeling defensive just because of the way she talks to me in this aggressive manner (and maybe this is where I went wrong, because I could've given her the benefit of the doubt still, but I kept my cool at least). I didn't think she meant it in a bad way because the context at first, but then I started recalling other times she called her host mom a bitch (just because she tried politely asking my ex to stop fucking up various things lol) and I recalled times when she told me she feels bad about having casual sex and then my anger started to build up because I was just mad that she thinks that way. So my plan was just to go home and cool off and think it over.\\n\\nShe asked me if I still want to go to my place as we get to my car. I say, \\"actually I'm just gonna drop you off and go home by myself, I'm sorry\\" trying to sound normal. And she says \\"what? when were you planning on telling me this?\\" and continues in her aggressive tone repeating the questions many times in rapid fashion as I respond with \\"just now. I just decided\\". She demands to know why and I say because how she's acting. And then she starts to lose it more and shoots off all these questions in a row until I tell her I think it was fucked up that she calls her host mom a bitch and it sounds like she thinks very negatively about girls having sex. And then she tells me of course she didn't mean it in a negative way and that she doesn't speak English that well and can't explain what she meant. Then shouts that I'm crazy like 5 times, tells me to go fuck myself, that I need to see a therapist, and idk what else for 5 minutes nonstop until we got to her place and she said \\"bye forever\\".

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

He has released several solo albums as a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist and has been the lead singer for King Crimson since 2013. His work has been variously credited to \\"Jakko\\", \\"Jakko Jakszyk\\", and \\"Jakko M. Jakszyk\\". Before joining King Crimson, he led bands for over thirty years, including 64 Spoons, Dizrhythmia, 21st Century Schizoid Band, Jakszyk Fripp Collins, and Rapid Eye Movement.\\nContext: By 1975, Jakszyk was leading an eccentric jazz-rock band called Soon After. His self-confessed \\"dictatorial tendencies\\" reduced a bigger line-up to a trio of \\"two screaming lead guitars and a trumpet\\" (the latter played by ex-National Youth Jazz Orchestra member Ted Emmett). The band reached the finals of the 1975 Melody Maker National Rock/Folk competition, finishing third to a heavy metal band featuring future Clash co-leader Mick Jones and to a big band featuring future saxophone session musician Gary Barnacle. When Soon After split up, Jakszyk toured with \\"a strange little band\\" which supported Camel, Stackridge, and Judas Priest, then briefly joined a Tring-based band called Synthesis which played progressive rock in the Canterbury-scene vein.  Jakszyk's first significant band was 64 Spoons, which he joined as guitarist and lead singer in 1976, co-writing much of the band's material. Between 1976 and 1980, 64 Spoons wrote and performed a blend of pop, progressive rock, jazz, and comedy (typified by their single \\"Ladies Don't Have Willies\\"). Boosted by an exuberant and funny live show, 64 Spoons proved popular with audiences but failed to gain an effective record deal or media breakthrough and split up in 1980. Their only album, Landing on a Rat Column, was eventually released in 1992, many years after it was recorded. Jakszyk would described them as \\"the wrong band at the wrong time\\".  64 Spoons's work did, however, lead to friendships with several of the musicians who had inspired the band, notably keyboard player Dave Stewart. Following the split of 64 Spoons, Jakszyk joined Stewart, Rick Biddulph, and Pip Pyle in the band Rapid Eye Movement. Jakszyk contributed several songs to the band's repertoire (\\"One More Time\\", \\"I'll Stand On My Own\\", \\"Ingmar Bergman on the Window Sill\\", \\"Straining Our Eyes\\", and \\"Dear Clare\\", the last of these a 64 Spoons song) and co-wrote material with Stewart (\\"This Is Not What I Want\\" and \\"'Allo Darlin' I Work on the Fair\\"). Between August 1980 and June 1981, Rapid Eye Movement toured Spain, France, and the UK and recorded material but split up due to Stewart's desire to concentrate on studio work (Jakszyk sang on the original version of Stewart's cover of \\"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted?\\", later a hit with a new vocal track by the Zombies' lead singer Colin Blunstone).  During this period, Jakszyk also contributed to sessions for the former Van der Graaf Generator saxophonist David Jackson's album The Long Hello Vol. 3 (eventually released in 1982).\\nQuestion: How long did the band stay together?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"When Soon After split up, Jakszyk toured with \\"a strange little band\\"","rationale":"The answer to the question can be found in this sentence: \\"When Soon After split up, Jakszyk toured with \\"a strange little band\\" which supported Camel, Stackridge, and Judas Priest\\". \\nFrom it we infer that the time span of their activity together was not long."},{"source":"If \\"People awaiting a train to stop.\\", does this mean that \\"The train will not stop\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"it is not possible to tell","rationale":"There is not enough information in the context to accurately predict whether or not the train will stop.

Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series. First mentioned in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\\" the Ministry makes its first proper appearance in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\". Throughout the books, it is generally depicted as either corrupt, incompetent, or both, with its high officials blind to actual events and dangers. It reaches a nadir of corruption before being effectively taken over by Lord Voldemort. At the end of the final book, following Voldemort's death, Kingsley Shacklebolt takes over the ministry, changing it for the better. By the time of \\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\\", Hermione Granger is the Minister for Magic.\\n\\n- Harry and the Potters and the Power of Love , or Power of Love , is the third studio album by indie rock band Harry and the Potters , released on July 4 , 2006 . The album was primarily inspired by the sixth novel in the Harry Potter book series .\\n\\n- Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.\\n\\n- Lord Voldemort (or in the films) (born Tom Marvolo Riddle) is a fictional character and the central antagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of \\"Harry Potter\\" novels. Voldemort first appeared in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\", which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", where he is only mentioned.\\n\\n- A story arc is an extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television, comic books, comic strips, boardgames, video games, and films with each episode following a narrative arc. On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies, especially in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term \\"story arc\\" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series \\"Wiseguy\\", and was quickly adapted for other uses.\\n\\n- Ronald Bilius \\"Ron\\" Weasley is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family, who reside in \\"The Burrow\\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of the Gryffindor house. Ron is present in most of the action throughout the series.\\n\\n- In the \\"Harry Potter\\" book series, a Muggle is a person who lacks any sort of magical ability and was not born in a magical family. Muggles can also be described as people who do not have any magical blood in them. It differs from the term \\"Squib\\", which refers to a person with one or more magical parents yet without any magical power/ability, and from the term Muggle-born (or the derogatory and offensive term \\"mudblood\\"), which refers to a person with magical abilities but with non-magical parents. The equivalent term used by the in-universe magic community of America is No-Maj.\\n\\n- Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. \\n\\n- Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles.\\n\\n- Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.\\n\\n- Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\\n\\n- Harry and the Potters are an American rock band known for spawning the genre of wizard rock. Founded in Norwood, Massachusetts in 2002, the group is primarily composed of brothers Joe and Paul DeGeorge, who both perform under the persona of the title character from the \\"Harry Potter\\" book series. Harry and the Potters are known for their elaborate live performances, and have developed a cult following within the \\"Harry Potter\\" fandom.\\n\\n- A persona (plural personae or personas), in the word's everyday usage, is a social role or a character played by an actor. The word is derived from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The Latin word probably derived from the Etruscan word \\"phersu\\", with the same meaning, and that from the Greek  (\\"prospon\\"). Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a \\"character\\" of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role, and legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance. According to other sources, which also admit that the origin of the term is not completely clear, \\"persona\\" could possibly be related to the Latin verb \\"per-sonare\\", literally: \\"sounding through\\", with an obvious link to the above-mentioned theatrical mask.\\n\\n- Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.\\n\\n- Joanne \\"Jo\\" Rowling, (born 31 July 1965), pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist, screenwriter and film producer best known as the author of the \\"Harry Potter\\" fantasy series. The books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, and sold more than 400 million copies. They have become the best-selling book series in history and been the basis for a series of films over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and maintained creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Wizard rock (sometimes shortened as Wrock) is a genre of rock music that developed between 2002 and 2004 in the United States. Wizard rock bands are characterized by their performances and humorous songs about the \\"Harry Potter\\" universe. Wizard rock initially started in Massachusetts with Harry and the Potters, though it has grown internationally.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'harry and the potters and the power of love' with the relationship of 'genre'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- action\\n - alternative rock\\n - art\\n - book\\n - book series\\n - britpop\\n - chronicle\\n - comic\\n - family\\n - fantasy\\n - fashion\\n - genre\\n - government\\n - grunge\\n - independent music\\n - indie pop\\n - indie rock\\n - law\\n - music\\n - musical\\n - new wave\\n - play\\n - rock\\n - rock music\\n - science\\n - shoegazing\\n - supernatural\\n - television\\n - television series\\n - universe\\n - wizard rock","target":"wizard rock","rationale":"Harry and the Potters are an American rock band known for spawning the genre of wizard rock.

It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches.

The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes.\\nThey are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing.

Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753.

Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface).

A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after  Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were sold for as much as $500.

The developments in bioinformatics, proteomics, immunogenomics, structural biology and other sciences have spurred the growth of vaccinomics where computer assisted approaches serve to identify suitable peptide targets for eventual development of vaccines. In this mini-review we give a brief overview of some of the recent trends in computer assisted vaccine development with emphasis on the primary selection procedures of probable peptide candidates for vaccine development.","target":"Molecular Sciences A Brief Review of Computer-Assisted Approaches to Rational Design of Peptide Vaccines","rationale":"The title should provide a brief overview of the review paper and emphasize the key topics covered in the paper.

He developed the prototype game in 24 hours and released it for free online through the Kongregate website, receiving 100,000 'plays' in the first week. He joined Bossa Studios in February 2011, working to expand the flash-based Thomas to a full title and learning how to use the Unity engine in his time there. The full game was released on 30 June 2012 and went on to sell over a million copies, winning a BAFTA at the 9th British Academy Games Awards in the \\"Best Performer\\" category (for narrator Danny Wallace) and receiving a further two nominations (\\"Best Original Music\\" and \\"Best Story\\"). He left Bossa in January 2013 to \\"concentrate on indie development\\". He since worked on a Robin Hood-based stealth game named Volume, which was released on 18 August 2015 for Windows, OS X, and PlayStation 4 and Vita platforms. In 2016, Bithell released EarthShape, a virtual reality game for Google Daydream. Bithell collaborated with composer Russell Shaw and animator Tim Borelli on the project. The game featured voice acting from British comedian Sue Perkins. In August 2017, Bithell released a new game Subsurface Circular, a first of what he calls \\"Bithell Shorts\\" that are designed as short, focused narrative games.

Although the group enjoyed some support and continued after the Second World War they never became sufficiently important for the government to take action against them. The other main fascist group was the Ossewabrandwag (OB), founded in 1939, a group also inspired by Adolf Hitler. The two differed however as the Greyshirts emphasised Aryan race rhetoric and so organised amongst the various white immigrant communities whilst the OB were specifically for Afrikaner only. A third, more minor group, the New Order, emerged in 1940 under the leadership of former cabinet minister Oswald Pirow. After the Second World War Pirow became an important figure in neo-fascism, working closely with Oswald Mosley, Nation Europa and A. F. X. Baron. Nazi Germany sought to encourage such activity with former Olympic boxer Robey Leibbrandt active as an agent for the Abwehr during the war.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire.

Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage.

He made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Bangladesh in 2003, and played his first Test the following year against Australia. He captained the Indian team in six ODIs from late-2010 to late-2011 with India winning all six matches.\\n\\nGambhir scored two successive double-hundreds in 2002 (one of them against the visiting Zimbabweans) made him a strong contender for India's opening slot in all three forms of the game. He made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in the TVS Cup in 2003. In his third match, he scored 71 and was named Man of the Match. His maiden century (103 off 97 balls) came against Sri Lanka in 2005. In 2004, he made his Test debut against Australia in the fourth and last Test match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy but did himself no favours by getting out for 3 and 1. He made amends in his second Test, however, scoring 96 against the South Africans. His maiden Test century came against Bangladesh in December 2004. Gambhir then made a number of starts in the home series against Pakistan in 2005, but was able to make only one half-century in six innings. He made 97 in Zimbabwe later that year, but failed to reach 30 against Sri Lanka at home, repeatedly struggling against Chaminda Vaas, and was subsequently dropped from the Test team. He was replaced in Tests by Wasim Jaffer, who made a double hundred and a hundred in seven Tests.  While Gambhir was out of the Test team, he played a number of One Day Internationals for India between 2005 and 2007. However, he was not selected for the 2007 World Cup as the selectors opted for a top-order of Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, and Sachin Tendulkar. It affected him badly and Gambhir later said that \\"When I got dropped for the World Cup, there were times I didn't want to play anymore. I didn't want to practise. I couldn't motivate myself.\\" With no other career options, Gambhir stuck with cricket. After India's first-round exit from the tournament, Gambhir was selected for the One Day International on India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh. Believing the series could be his last chance, Gambhir scored his second century on that tour and was subsequently selected for the One Day International on India's tour to Ireland in 2007. He scored an unbeaten 80 against Ireland in the first game of that tour and was awarded the man of the match award for that effort. In the post-match interview, he indicated that performing more consistently was a top priority for his career as he had done so in the past.  Gambhir was selected in India's squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, which India went on to win in South Africa, beating Pakistan in the final. Gambhir performed well in the shortest form of the game, ending the tournament as India's top run scorer, with 227 at an average of 37.83, including three half-centuries which included a crucial 75 runs off 54 balls against Pakistan in the final.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Gautam Gambhir","rationale":"The given text is about cricketer Gautam Gambhir.

Children were not placed on medication unless they demonstrated characteristic impulsive, inattentive, and/or overactive behavior in two of three environments (home, school, clinic). Fifty-two children (80%) were not placed on medication. Follow-up was completed in 80 percent, and 93 percent of these children were doing well with nonpharmacologic interventions.

Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural.

Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme.

The first line asks for information about Micronesia, and the second line gives some basic details about it, including its location. However, this is not the critical location because there is no further discussion about it in this conversation. Then, the third line says that it sounds like a beautiful place; so we do not know where \\"it\\" refers to (most likely Micronesia), but since this comment does not provide additional context or situational significance, it cannot be considered as a critical location either. In the fourth line, we learn that they have voted with respect to United Nations; however, we do not yet know who \\"they\\" are (most likely referring to Micronesia). This still does not provide any more situational significance for identifying a critical location than what was known already from lines 2 and 3.

If an element can form cations of different charges, there are two alternate systems for indicating the compound’s name.

In the common system, the suffixes -ous and -ic are used to stand for the lower and higher possible charge of the cation, respectively. These suffixes are attached to a stem representing the element (which frequently comes from the Latin form of the element name). An example is the common name for FeCl2, which is ferrous chloride. The formula mass of an ionic compound is the sum of the masses of each individual atom in the formula. Care must be taken when calculating formula masses for formulas containing multiple polyatomic ions because the subscript outside the parentheses refers to all the atoms in the polyatomic ion.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- magnetic compound\\n\\n- localized compound\\n\\n- covalent bonds\\n\\n- ionic compound\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"ionic compound","rationale":"Ionic compounds are named by their positive and negative ions.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population.

High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.\\n\\nParagraph: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which sample the materials might not have been carried away?","target":"sample B","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that high rainfall carries away materials, exposing new surfaces for chemical reactions. The rain-forest gets one of the highest rainfall in the world and Atacama Desert is a desert where they get some of the least amount of rains. This means that rain forest soil would have had more water to carry away material than sample B from atacama desert. In this case, we can safely say that sample A has higher chance having its materials carried away compared to Sample B as it's an arid place with very less rains. Thus, answer should be \\"sample B\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

After passing his company officer career, at last in the Generalquartiermeister staff in Munich, he was transferred to the General Command in Munich as major of the general staff. The first time, he served for the war ministry, he was ordered by Von Lüder. In 1863 he became head of department at the war ministry. Also he was adjutant of Eduard von Lutz, as well as representative of him at the Landtag. In 1865 he was advanced to Oberstleutnant, in 1866 he Oberst. Thenceforward he was commander of the 7th Royal Bavarian Infantry Regiment and deputy of Von Lutz. In 1869 he became major general and commander of the 8th Royal Bavarian Infantry Brigade. One year after that, he was advanced to lieutenant general, and led the 2nd Royal Bavarian Division during the campaigns of the Franco-Prussian War, which stood in France as part of the Bavarian occupation army until 1873. After he returned to Bavaria, he became commander of the II Royal Bavarian Corps.

In other words, Westerners tend to put most of their ideas and feelings into words, and then state these ideas and feelings clearly and openly. It is generally considered a good thing to \\"get to the point \\"and \\"say what you mean,\\" and it is largely the speaker's responsibility to ensure that his/her message is stated in a way that is clear and easy to understand.\\nIn contrast , Chinese people tend to communicate in a way that is more indirect and subtle. They often view direct, explicit communication as unsophisticated or even rude. They are more likely to preserve good feelings and relationships by not saying something that might upset or offend  another person. If a Westerner makes a request and a Chinese person responds by saying something like \\"I'll think it over\\", the Westerner may assume that there is a good chance that the answer will be \\"yes\\". In fact, there is a better chance that the implied answer is \\"no\\".\\nOne interesting example of the Western preference for very direct communication can be seen in what Western students are taught about how they should organize their writing. Writers are generally expected to state their point as clearly as possible, generally right at the beginning. Students are taught to begin paragraphs with a \\"topic sentence\\" that states the point of the paragraph. Also, articles should generally begin with a brief statement of the points to be made -and also conclude with a review of those same points. In contrast, in Chinese writing it is more acceptable to build up to the point rather announcing it right form the start, although it is also acceptable to state the point up front.\\nIt is important to note that Westerners are not all equally direct in their communication styles. For example, the direct communication style is more typical of Western men than of Western women.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

During the 6 to 24 hour period, the control group (n = 20) developed ventricular triplets at rates exceeding 270/min. Seven dogs spontaneously developed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (421 +/- 12 beats/min) at 13 +/- 2 hours. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was present for 38 +/- 8 seconds before ventricular fibrillation developed. One dog developed recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, with six episodes lasting from 8 to 72 seconds (375 to 425 beats/min). At 24 hours, ventricular pacing produced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (378 +/- 12 beats/min) in 9 of 13 surviving animals. Nadolol administration 6 hours after coronary artery ligation (n = 19) lowered both the rate (241 +/- 8 versus 328 +/- 8 beats/min; p = 0.001) and the incidence (8 +/- 6 versus 198 +/- 61 per hour; p = 0.004) of rapid ventricular triplets and prevented sudden arrhythmic death (0%; p = 0.005). Nadolol failed to prevent sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (88%; 365 +/- 12 beats/min) produced by ventricular pacing. The data suggest that nadolol prevents spontaneous sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia by selectively suppressing the arrhythmia trigger (rapid ventricular triplets) without altering the underlying arrhythmia substrate. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Bronchitis 3)Bronchoscopy","target":"No","rationale":"The given abstract is about \\"Electrocardiographic monitoring and provocative ventricular pacing were used to evaluate control and nadolol treatment groups 6 to 24 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in the dog\\".

Human prehistory is the period from the time that behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appear until the appearance of recorded history following the invention of writing systems. Since both the time of settlement of modern humans and the evolution of human civilisations differ from region to region, prehistory starts and ends at different moments in time, depending on the region concerned.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

The Lazic War lasted for twenty years, from 541 to 562, with varying success and ended in a relative victory for the Byzantines, who kept their control of the country. The Lazic War is narrated in detail in the works of Procopius of Caesarea and Agathias.\\n\\n- The Baltic Sea (  ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude.

A well - educated and successful lawyer , he was repeatedly sent as envoy to Ostrogothic Italy in the prelude to the Gothic War of 535 -- 554 . Despite his diplomatic skill , he was not able to avert war , and was imprisoned by the Goths in Ravenna for a few years . Upon his release , he was appointed to the post of magister officiorum , head of the imperial secretariat , which he held for an unparalleled 26 years . In this capacity , he was one of the leading ministers of Emperor Justinian I ( r. 527 -- 565 ) , playing an important role in the Byzantine emperor 's religious policies and the relations with Sassanid Persia ; most notably he led the negotiations for the peace agreement of 562 that ended the 20 - year - long Lazic War . His historical writings survive only in fragments , but provide unique source material on early Byzantine ceremonies and diplomatic issues between Byzantium and the Sassanids .\\n\\n- The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.\\n\\n- A diploma (from Greek µ \\"díplma\\", meaning \\"folded paper\\") is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as a college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study, or (US) recording that an academic degree has been awarded.

Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document, thus diplomatic, diplomat and diplomacy via the \\"Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus\\".\\n\\n- A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it. Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Although \\"historian\\" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians, though, are recognized by publications or training and experience. \\"Historian\\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere.\\n\\n- An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used \\"honorific\\" for remarkable lawyers, such as in \\"Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili\\". The broad equivalent in many English law-based jurisdictions can be a \\"barrister\\". However, in Scottish, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, advocate is also a word to indicate lawyers of superior classification.\\n\\n- Justinian I  (482 14 November 565), traditionally known as Justinian the Great and also Saint Justinian the Great in the Eastern Orthodox Church, was a Byzantine (East Roman) emperor from 527 to 565. During his reign, Justinian sought to revive the empire's greatness and reconquer the lost western half of the historical Roman Empire. Justinian's rule constitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the Later Roman empire, and his reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized \\"renovatio imperii\\", or \\"restoration of the Empire\\".\\n\\n- The Kingdom of the Lombards also known as the Lombard Kingdom; later the Kingdom of (all) Italy, was an early medieval state established by the Lombards, a Germanic-speaking people, on the Italian Peninsula in the latter part of the 6th century. The king was traditionally elected by the highest-ranking aristocrats, the dukes, as several attempts to establish a hereditary dynasty failed. The kingdom was subdivided into a varying number of duchies, ruled by semi-autonomous dukes, which were in turn subdivided into gastaldates at the municipal level. The capital of the kingdom and the center of its political life was Pavia in the modern northern Italian region of Lombardy.\\n\\n- A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- Ravenna (also locally ) is the capital city of the Province of Ravenna, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. It was the capital city of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths until it was re-conquered in 540 by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Afterwards, the city formed the centre of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until the invasion of the Lombards in 751, after which it became the seat of the Kingdom of the Lombards.\\n\\n- The Sasanian Empire (or ), also known as Sassanian, Sasanid, Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire), known to its inhabitants as rnshahr in Middle Persian, was the last imperial dynasty in Persia (Iran) before the rise of Islam, ruled by and named after the Sasanian dynasty from 224 to 651 AD. The Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighboring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years.\\n\\n- The magister officiorum (Latin literally for \\"Master of Offices\\", in , \\"magistros tn offikin\\") was one of the most senior administrative officials in the late Roman Empire and the early centuries of the Byzantine Empire. In Byzantium, the office was eventually transformed into a senior honorary rank, until it disappeared in the 12th century.\\n\\n- History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.\\n\\n- Romagna (Romagnol: \\"Rumâgna\\") is an Italian historical region that approximately corresponds to the south-eastern portion of present-day Emilia-Romagna. Traditionally, it is limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region). The region has been recently formally expanded with the transfer of seven comuni (Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant'Agata Feltria, Talamello) from the Marche region, which are a small number of comuni where Romagnolo dialect is spoken.\\nEtymology.\\nThe name \\"Romagna\\" comes from the Latin name \\"Romània\\", which originally was the generic name for \\"land inhabited by Romans\\", and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century.\\nIt later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek).\\nThus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\".\\n\\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times.\\nHistory.\\nPrehistory.\\nA number of archaeological sites in the region, such as Monte Poggiolo, show that Romagna has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age.\\n\\n\\n\\n'peter the patrician' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'languages spoken or written'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- danish\\n - english\\n - french\\n - georgian\\n - greek\\n - italian\\n - latin\\n - medieval greek\\n - persian\\n - portugal\\n - portuguese\\n - spain\\n - turkish","target":"medieval greek","rationale":"According to the given context, Peter is a Greek historian who wrote in Medieval Greek.
