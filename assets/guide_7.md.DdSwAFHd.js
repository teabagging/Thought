They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions, and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in popular music history. Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals.\\n\\nIn December 1967, the group added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of PS30 per week (equivalent to PS500 in 2016), and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: \\"The idea was that Dave would ... cover for [Barrett's] eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved\\". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\", instead introduced \\"Have You Got It Yet?\\" to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.  Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a conclusion in January while en route to a performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was \\"Nah, let's not bother\\", signalling the end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd. Waters later admitted, \\"He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him\\". In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave.  Jenner and King believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. Morrison then sold his business to NEMS Enterprises, and O'Rourke became the band's personal manager. Blackhill announced Barrett's departure on 6 April 1968. After Barrett's departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction fell mostly on Waters. Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett's voice on the group's European TV appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in favour of Waters and Wright material such as \\"It Would Be So Nice\\" and \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\".\\n\\nWhat was the most interesting part of the article?","target":"In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.","rationale":"Based on the article, Syd Barrett was a founding member of Pink Floyd and one of its five members.

Sexual reproduction is the random fertilization of a gamete from the female using a gamete from the male. In humans, over 8 million (2 23 ) chromosome combinations exist in the production of gametes in both the male and female. Essentially, when the homologous pairs of chromosomes line up during metaphase I and then are separated at anaphase I, there are (2 23 ) possible combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes. During random fertilization, a sperm cell, with over 8 million possible chromosome combinations, fertilizes an egg cell, which also has over 8 million possible chromosome combinations. Together, there are over 64 trillion unique combinations, not counting the additional variation produced by crossing-over during prophase I. In other words, each human couple could produce a child with over 64 trillion unique chromosome combinations!.\\n\\n\\nQ: What type of cell does the sperm cell fertilize?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- fat\\n\\n- bacteria\\n\\n- protein\\n\\n- egg\\n\\nA:","target":"egg","rationale":"In the beginning of the paragraph, it mentions that \\"Sexual reproduction is the random fertilization of a gamete from the female using a gamete from the male\\".

They also managed to qualify for the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. In 2014, Costa Rica made their best performance in history by finishing first in their group that consisted of three former World Cup champions: Uruguay, Italy, and England. During the Round of 16 they defeated Greece 5–3 via a penalty shootout after a 1–1 draw. Moreover, during the match against a much better team, Navas saved more than 15 shots due to the Costa Rican very weak defense. The match was characterized as \\"Navas vs Greece\\".

In two seasons from 1978 to 1980, he played 133 games for the Nets, averaging 9.0 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. In 1980, Boynes was made available in the NBA expansion draft in which he was selected by the Dallas Mavericks. He was part of the starting lineup for the Mavs' first NBA game in 1980, in which he top-scored with 21 points in a 103–92 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.\\n Passage 3:In the late 1950s, Dunstan became well known for his campaign against the death penalty being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Premier Thomas Playford IV aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as a turning point in the Liberal and Country League's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy. Labor conducted an extensive campaign in marginal LCL seats at the 1965 election, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with Frank Walsh and the Labor Party taking power and Dunstan becoming Attorney-General. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young Steele Hall, worrying Labor as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in Labor replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander and was able to convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election.

Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied Yemen and Algeria, frequently as provincial governors.","target":"made up a significant proportion","rationale":"The context of the question is about how Greeks affected the Ottoman army and navy.\\nAccording to this context, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment as well as in other fields such as politics, finance etc. \\nGreek-origin men also made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman state bureaucracy and forces which governed provinces from Egypt to Algeria frequently acting as provincial governors."},{"source":"Answer the question below:\\n\\n\\nWhen we have a very windy day what will happen to the waves increase or decrease? \\n\\n\\nAssuming that:\\n\\nThe faster, longer, and farther the wind blows, the bigger the waves are.","target":"increase","rationale":"When we have a very windy day what will happen to the waves increase or decrease?\\nAssuming that: The faster, longer, and farther the wind blows, the bigger the waves are.\\nSo when it has a windy day then there is more wave generated than usual day."},{"source":"Here's a short story: Shane is dragging a box across the floor in his home.

The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate.\\nShostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram.

The last sentence of the paragraph says that \\"the pituitary helps regulates production of urine.\\" This is because it produces vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone), which plays a role in managing how much water we excrete through urination by regulating renal function; thus, excess hydration will lead to less frequent urination while dehydration tells us when its time for going bathroom more often.

The place was nearly empty when I carried Mia inside, just one couple and their kids sitting in a circle in the corner. The parents  glanced up at us, then went back to praying quietly.

Subsets of human monocytes with differential representation in various disease states are well known. In contrast, mouse monocyte subsets have been characterized minimally. In this study we identify three subpopulations of mouse monocytes that can be distinguished by differential expression of Ly-6C, CD43, CD11c, MBR, and CD62L. The subsets share the characteristics of extensive phagocytosis, similar expression of M-CSF receptor (CD115), and development into macrophages upon M-CSF stimulation. By eliminating blood monocytes with dichloromethylene-bisphosphonate-loaded liposomes and monitoring their repopulation, we showed a developmental relationship between the subsets. Monocytes were maximally depleted 18 h after liposome application and subsequently reappeared in the circulation. These cells were exclusively of the Ly-6C(high) subset, resembling bone marrow monocytes. Serial flow cytometric analyses of newly released Ly-6C(high) monocytes showed that Ly-6C expression on these cells was down-regulated while in circulation. Under inflammatory conditions elicited either by acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes or chronic infection with Leishmania major, there was a significant increase in immature Ly-6C(high) monocytes, resembling the inflammatory left shift of granulocytes. In addition, acute peritoneal inflammation recruited preferentially Ly-6C(med-high) monocytes. Taken together, these data identify distinct subpopulations of mouse blood monocytes that differ in maturation stage and capacity to become recruited to inflammatory sites.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not have a topic sentence, relevant supporting sentences, and a closing sentence.

This led to the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757, in which the Bengal Army of the East India Company, led by Robert Clive, defeated the French-supported Nawab's forces. This was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the British acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the company as its first 'Governor of Bengal' in 1757. This was combined with British victories over the French at Madras, Wandiwash and Pondichéry that, along with wider British successes during the Seven Years' War, reduced French influence in India. The British East India Company extended its control over the whole of Bengal. After the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the company acquired the rights of administration in Bengal from de jure Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II; this marked the beginning of its formal rule, which within the next century engulfed most of India. The East India Company monopolized the trade of Bengal.

I was on the phone, helping a patient, and also filling prescriptions as fast as I could. The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces. And then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me. There was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone. My bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do. The next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that.

He was upset by my outwardly emotionless reaction to not just his mother’s death, but really anything related to the situation. It’s not that I didn’t care about my father and what he was going through. It’s just that I didn’t have the strong emotional connection that my father had, or anything close to it, to display that I was in fact emotionally moved by a VERY raw display of reality in front of me.

Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces,...","target":"Bacon","rationale":"In the text, it says that \\"Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work\\".

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will.

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. Interpretation Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.","target":"Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries","rationale":"A short summary of the paper is: “Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries”."},{"source":"Answer this question: when was the internet started?","target":"The history of the Internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s.","rationale":"The history of the Internet began with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s."},{"source":"In this task, we ask you to write an answer to a question about when an event happened.

In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date.

He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked vigilante who defends the commoners and indigenous peoples of California against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black costume includes a cape, a hat known as sombrero cordobes, and a domino mask that covers the upper part of his face. In the stories, Zorro has a high bounty on his head, but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them.\\nContext: In The Curse of Capistrano, Senor Zorro became an outlaw in the pueblo of Los Angeles in California \\"to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed.\\" He is the title character, as he is dubbed the \\"Curse of Capistrano\\". The novel features extensively both Don Diego Vega and Zorro, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, both Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless fop, she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also has his eyes on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro's enemy but Diego's friend; Diego's deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega, the richest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Dona Catalina, Lolita's parents; and a group of noblemen (caballeros) who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause.  In later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro's identity.  In McCulley's later stories, Diego's surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive and the next entry had the double identity still secret.  Several Zorro productions have expanded on the character's exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.  McCulley's stories are set during the during the era of Spanish California (1769-1821) and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded.

The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).\\n\\nThe Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year.\\n\\nWhich river flows into a sea with stronger tidal currents?","target":"Danube","rationale":"The passage explains that one of the requirements for a river to form a delta is the strength of tidal currents.

They did not experience much commercial success in the UK, but became popular in Italy during the 1970s. In 2005 the band reformed. The band formed at Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma.\\n\\nHammill's split with the group was amicable, and Banton, Jackson, and Evans, among others, all contributed to his solo work at various times. By 1975, the members of the band were ready to work with each other again, and they decided to reform the band. All the members were keen on carrying on with new music, with no nostalgia for their previous era, and did not want to play earlier stage favourites such as \\"Killer\\" (the opening track on H to He, Who Am the Only One) and \\"Theme One\\". \\"We didn't want to continue as if nothing had happened,\\" said Hammill.  The reformed band worked at a prolific pace, rehearsing, and touring France before recording three new albums in just 12 months, beginning with Godbluff (October 1975). Unlike the earlier work with John Anthony at Trident, the sessions were produced by the band themselves, and both the Melody Maker and Sounds thought they were a tighter and more cohesive unit than previously. The album in particular saw Hammill making significant use of the Hohner clavinet keyboard. Still Life followed on 15 April 1976. Banton considers this album one of his favourites by the group.  In the summer of 1975, the band gigged in Italy without incident, but when they returned to tour there in November, the intense political situation the country was going through caught up with them. The opening concert in Padova was marked with clashes with communists delivering political speeches, and the audience started throwing missiles towards the stage. After a gig without incident in Genoa, the third day of the tour at the PalaSport in Rome, in front of 40,000 people, saw similar confrontations to the Padova gig. A fire broke out at the venue, but was brought under control. The next day, the band learned that most of their gear had been stolen from the tour van, including Hammill's blue Fender Stratocaster, christened \\"Meurglys\\". Despite threats from promoters that the band would continue the tour using hired equipment (which Jackson considered impossible given the electronic modifications he had made to his saxophones), they abandoned the tour. Miraculously, all of Jackson's saxophones had survived the theft.  In December 1976, following World Record, Banton quit, quickly followed by Jackson in February 1977. Nic Potter returned to replace Banton, and in a typically eccentric move Jackson was replaced by a violinist, Graham Smith (formerly of Charisma folk-rock band String Driven Thing). This line-up produced the album The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome (September 1977). The band also shortened its name to Van der Graaf. Charles Dickie then joined the band on cello, documented on the live double-album Vital, which saw a brief reunion with Jackson. By the time Vital was released, in July 1978, the band had already split, because of lack of record company support in the United States and financial difficulties.  In 1982 a collection of out-takes and rehearsal recordings from the 1972-1975 hiatus was released (initially on cassette only), called Time Vaults.

IA-32 is the first incarnation of x86 that supports 32-bit computing; as a result, the \\"IA-32\\" term may be used as a metonym to refer to all x86 versions that support 32-bit computing.\\n\\n- Opteron is AMD's x86 server and workstation processor line, and was the first processor which supported the AMD64 instruction set architecture (known generically as x86-64). It was released on April 22, 2003 with the \\"SledgeHammer\\" core (K8) and was intended to compete in the server and workstation markets, particularly in the same segment as the Intel Xeon processor. Processors based on the AMD K10 microarchitecture (codenamed \\"Barcelona\\") were announced on September 10, 2007 featuring a new quad-core configuration. The most-recently released Opteron CPUs are the Piledriver-based Opteron 4300 and 6300 series processors, codenamed \\"Seoul\\" and \\"Abu Dhabi\\" respectively. In January 2016, the first ARMv8-A based Opteron SoC was released.\\n\\n- Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of x86-compatible microprocessors designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The original Athlon (now called \\"Athlon Classic\\") was the first seventh-generation x86 processor. The original Athlon was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz). AMD has continued using the \\"Athlon\\" name with the Athlon 64, an eighth-generation processor featuring x86-64 (later renamed AMD64) architecture, and the Athlon II. AMD also uses the \\"Athlon\\" name for some of its series of APUs targeting the Socket AM1 desktop SoC architecture.\\n\\n- The Athlon 64 X2 is the first dual - core desktop CPU designed by AMD . It was designed from scratch as native dual - core by using an already multi-CPU enabled Athlon 64 , joining it with another functional core on one die , and connecting both via a shared dual - channel memory controller / north bridge and additional control logic . The initial versions are based on the E-stepping model of the Athlon 64 and , depending on the model , have either 512 or 1024 KB of L2 Cache per core . The Athlon 64 X2 is capable of decoding SSE3 instructions ( except those few specific to Intel 's architecture ) . In June 2007 , AMD released low - voltage variants of their low - end 65 nm Athlon 64 X2 , named \`\` Athlon X2 '' . The Athlon X2 processors feature reduced TDP of 45 W. The name was also used for K10 based budget CPUs with two cores deactivated .\\n\\n- Pentium is a brand used for a series of x86-compatible microprocessors produced by Intel since 1993. In its current form, Pentium processors are considered entry-level products that Intel rates as \\"two stars\\", meaning that they are above the low-end Atom and Celeron series but below the faster Core i3, i5 and i7 lines as well as the high-end Xeon processors.\\n\\n- x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.\\n\\n- Intel Corporation (also known as Intel, stylized as intel) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California (colloquially referred to as \\"Silicon Valley\\") that was founded by Gordon Moore (of Moore's law fame) and Robert Noyce. It is the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue, and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors: the processors found in most personal computers (PCs). Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo (formerly IBM), HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.\\n\\n- 3DNow! is an extension to the x86 instruction set developed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It adds single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions to the base x86 instruction set, enabling it to perform vector processing, which improves the performance of many graphic-intensive applications. The first microprocessor to implement 3DNow was the AMD K6-2, which was introduced in 1998. When the application was appropriate this raised the speed by about 2-4 times.\\n\\n- Pentium 4 was a line of single-core central processing units (CPUs) for desktops, laptops and entry-level servers introduced by Intel on November 20, 2000 and shipped through August 8, 2008. They had a seventh-generation x86 (32-bit) microarchitecture, called NetBurst, which was the company's first all-new design since the introduction of the P6 microarchitecture of the Pentium Pro CPUs in 1995. NetBurst differed from P6 (Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds. Intel claimed that NetBurst would allow clock speeds of up to 10 GHz in future chips; however, severe problems with heat dissipation (especially with the Prescott Pentium 4) limited CPU clock speeds to a much lower 3.8 GHz.\\n\\n- The Athlon 64 is an eighth-generation, AMD64-architecture microprocessor produced by AMD, released on September 23, 2003. It is the third processor to bear the name \\"Athlon\\", and the immediate successor to the Athlon XP. The second processor (after the Opteron) to implement AMD64 architecture and the first 64-bit processor targeted at the average consumer, it was AMD's primary consumer microprocessor, and competes primarily with Intel's Pentium 4, especially the \\"Prescott\\" and \\"Cedar Mill\\" core revisions. It is AMD's first K8, eighth-generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers. Despite being natively 64-bit, the AMD64 architecture is backward-compatible with 32-bit x86 instructions. Athlon 64s have been produced for Socket 754, Socket 939, Socket 940 and Socket AM2. The line was succeeded by the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon X2 lines.\\n\\n- SSE3, Streaming SIMD Extensions 3, also known by its Intel code name Prescott New Instructions (PNI), is the third iteration of the SSE instruction set for the IA-32 (x86) architecture. Intel introduced SSE3 in early 2004 with the Prescott revision of their Pentium 4 CPU. In April 2005, AMD introduced a subset of SSE3 in revision E (Venice and San Diego) of their Athlon 64 CPUs. The earlier SIMD instruction sets on the x86 platform, from oldest to newest, are MMX, 3DNow! (developed by AMD), SSE and SSE2.\\n\\n- SSE2 (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2), is one of the Intel SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) processor supplementary instruction sets first introduced by Intel with the initial version of the Pentium 4 in 2001. It extends the earlier SSE instruction set, and is intended to fully replace MMX. Intel extended SSE2 to create SSE3 in 2004. SSE2 added 144 new instructions to SSE, which has 70 instructions. Competing chip-maker AMD added support for SSE2 with the introduction of their Opteron and Athlon 64 ranges of AMD64 64-bit CPUs in 2003.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'athlon 64 x2' and 'advanced micro devices'?","target":"designer","rationale":"The Athlon 64 X2 is the first dual-core desktop CPU designed by AMD.

Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today.

Given the association of IL23R with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we characterized the role of IL-17F in IBD including its intestinal gene expression and the effect of the IL17F p. His161Arg polymorphism on disease susceptibility and phenotype of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition, we analyzed the IL17F p. His161Arg polymorphism for potential epistasis with IL23R and NOD2/CARD15 variants.   \\n METHODS Intestinal IL-17F mRNA expression was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genomic DNA from 1682 individuals (CD: n = 499; UC: n = 216; controls: n = 967) was analyzed for the presence of the IL17F p. His161Arg polymorphism, the 3 NOD2 variants, p. Arg702Trp, p. Gly908Arg, and p. Leu1007fsX1008, and 10 CD-associated IL23R variants.   \\n RESULTS Intestinal IL-17F mRNA expression was 4.4-fold increased in inflamed colonic lesions compared to uninflamed biopsies in CD (P = 0.016) but not in UC. However, the mean intestinal IL-17F mRNA expression was higher in UC than in CD (P < 0.0001). The IL17F p. His161Arg substitution was observed with similar frequencies in IBD patients and controls and was not associated with a certain disease phenotype, but weakly associated with a low body mass index (BMI; P = 0.009) and an earlier age of disease onset (P = 0.039) in UC. There was no evidence for epistasis between the IL17F p. His161Arg polymorphism and IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms within the IL23R gene.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Intestinal IL17F gene expression is increased in active CD. The IL17F p.

His father, Taraqai, was a minor noble of the Barlas, a Mongolian tribe that had been turkified in many aspects. According to Gerard Chaliand, Timur was a Muslim, and he saw himself as Genghis Khan's heir. Though not a Borjigid or a descendent of Genghis Khan, he clearly sought to invoke the legacy of Genghis Khan's conquests during his lifetime.\\n\\nTimur is regarded as a military genius, and as a brilliant tactician with an uncanny ability to work within a highly fluid political structure to win and maintain a loyal following of nomads during his rule in Central Asia. He was also considered extraordinarily intelligent - not only intuitively but also intellectually. In Samarkand and his many travels, Timur, under the guidance of distinguished scholars, was able to learn the Persian, Mongolian, and Turkish languages. (according to Ahmad ibn Arabshah, Timur didn't know Arabic) More importantly, Timur was characterized as an opportunist. Taking advantage of his Turco-Mongolian heritage, Timur frequently used either the Islamic religion or the law and traditions of the Mongol Empire to achieve his military goals or domestic political aims. Timur, mostly considered a barbarian, in fact was a well learned king, and did enjoy the company of scholars --he was tolerant and generous to them against his nature. Once Persian poet Hafez wrote a ghazal whose verse says if this Turk accept his homage:  --For the black mole on his cheekI would give the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara  Timur upbraided him for this verse and said; \\"By the blows of my well tempered sword I have conquered the greater part of the world to enlarge Samarkand and Bukhara, my capitals and residences; and you pitiful creature would exchange these two cities for a mole\\". Hafez replied \\"O Sovereign of the world, it is by the state of similar generosity that I have been reduced, as you see my present state of poverty.\\" It is reported that the King was amazed by the witty answer and the poet departed with magnificent gifts.  Timur used Persian expressions in his conversations often, and his motto was the Persian phrase rasti rusti (rsty rsty, meaning \\"truth is safety\\" or \\"veritas salus\\").

At 11 am on 11 November 1918—\\"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\\"—a ceasefire came into effect. During the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended. The occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces. In November 1918, the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade Germany. Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some 720 kilometres  from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the stab-in-the-back legend, which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting , but to the public's failure to respond to its \\"patriotic calling\\" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks. The Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate  is that the Allies spent $58 billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25 billion.

It was one of two rovers of NASA's ongoing Mars Exploration Rover Mission. It landed successfully on Mars at 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, Opportunity (MER-B), landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition.\\n\\nOn January 21, 2004 (sol 17), Spirit abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. Spirit was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via X band to Mars Odyssey. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating - risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\\"Shutdown Dammit Until\\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.  The leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \\"reboot loop\\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the flash memory, the EEPROM, or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set - enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.  On sol 19 (January 24, 2004) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with Spirit's flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \\"not robust enough\\" for the operations the Spirit was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol 33), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.  Spirit drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, Spirit reached the first of many targets at the base of the Columbia Hills called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \\"Pot of Gold\\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the Mossbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite. This kind of rock can be built in connection with water.  As the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail. The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.  From here, Spirit took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, Spirit had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \\"Clovis\\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226-235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281-295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296-303). From Sols 239 to 262, Spirit powered down for solar conjunction, when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, Spirit made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \\"Cumberland Ridge\\" and into \\"Larry's Lookout\\" and \\"Tennessee Valley\\". Spirit also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter Mars Express though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters Mars Odyssey and Mars Global Surveyor.  During 2007 Spirit spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 Spirit climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, Spirit had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.  Towards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both Spirit and Opportunity were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \\"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\\". The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to Opportunity, and slightly more to Spirit.  Normally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to 700 watt-hours (2,500 kJ) of energy per Martian day. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to 128 watt-hours (460 kJ). If the rovers generate less than 150 watt-hours (540 kJ) per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.

He was of Luxembourgish ancestry. While Faber was a child, his father managed a tavern and later ran the Hotel Faber in Cascade. His father became one of the wealthiest citizens in Cascade.\\n\\nFaber enjoyed the greatest success of his career in the early 1920s. The live-ball era was beginning, but he was among the pitchers who made the most successful transition. The spitball was phased out after the 1920 season, with Faber one of the 17 pitchers permitted to use it for the remainder of their careers. He took advantage of Comiskey Park's spacious dimensions, surrendering only 91 home runs--barely one homer per month--from 1920 to 1931. He was one of only six pitchers to win 100 or more games in both the \\"dead ball\\" (through 1920) and live ball eras. Faber finished the 1920 season with 23 wins and led the league in games started.  During the summer of 1921, Faber and several other players had to leave a road trip in Washington after receiving subpoenas for the Black Sox trial in Chicago. Faber made the trip but was not asked to testify and he returned to the White Sox without missing a start. In 1921 and 1922, he posted win totals of 25 and 21, respectively, leading the league in ERA (1921-1922), innings (1922) and complete games (1921-1922). He was also among the league leaders in strikeouts each year, while pitching at least 25 complete games and over 300 innings.  In the wake of the Black Sox scandal, winning on a consistent basis became increasingly difficult. After being one of the top teams in the league with a powerful offense in the late 1910s, the White Sox had only two winning seasons in his last 13 years, never finishing above fifth place. In the 1921 season, he earned a 25-15 win-loss record for the post-scandal team that limped to a 62-92 finish; from 1921 to 1929 his record was 126-103. In 1927, Ty Cobb had a 21-game hitting streak which was broken when he faced Faber. Despite the widespread hitting of the era, he did not post an ERA over 3.88 until he was 41.

Unbeknownst to Johnny, Joe has been holding him back from his dream: playing in the legitimate pro tour.  When Johnny finally learns that Joe intercepted and threw away an invitation for Johnny to join the pro tour, he breaks from Joe, throwing a game with a large pot.  Losing both that stake money and his hustler income source sparks Joe to violence, and he breaks Johnny's bridge hand outside the pool hall (an homage to a similar scene in the classic pool film The Hustler).  Joe is later beaten up by some of Johnny's friends as a warning to leave him alone.\\nAfter an ultimatum from his girlfriend Tara, Johnny largely leaves the world of pool hustling, and finally commits to a \\"real\\" job in the construction business, but is soon miserable there. He finds himself spending most of his time with his younger brother Danny, a musician with aspirations of following in Johnny's hustler footsteps, despite Johnny's discouragement of this path.  Johnny meets Tara's wealthy uncle, Mike; he and Johnny hustle some of Mike's business associates, one an executive at Tara's employer. Rather than bet money or on himself, Johnny wagers a high-placed position for Tara, with Mike putting up an expensive car as their side of the stake.  Johnny wins a challenging trick-shot bet (to duplicate a difficult shot Mike had made in the previous game), and the promotion for Tara, but keeps the reason for her new opportunity a secret.

Each question is solvable with high school math knowledge. Give only one answer for each question.\\n\\nIf \\\\(wx = y\\\\), \\\\(xy = z\\\\) and \\\\(wxyz \\\\neq 0\\\\), which of the following is equal to \\\\(w\\\\) ?\\n(A)\\\\(xz\\\\) (B)\\\\(xz^2\\\\) (C)\\\\(\\\\frac { x } { z } \\\\) (D)\\\\(\\\\frac { z } { x } \\\\) (E)\\\\(\\\\frac { z } { x^2 } \\\\)","target":"E","rationale":"The given equations are:\\\\n\\\\(wx = y\\\\)  \\\\(\\\\implies\\\\) \\\\(wx^2 = xy\\\\)  \\\\(\\\\implies\\\\) \\\\(wxyz = xyz\\\\)\\\\nThis implies that \\\\(wxyz - xyz \\\\neq 0 \\\\implies wx - x \\\\neq 0\\\\). Simplifying this gives us \\\\(w \\\\neq 1\\\\), so the answer can't be (A), (B) or (D).\\nIt is also given that \\\\(xy = z\\\\), so we can substitute this in to get:\\n\\\\(wyxz – wyxz = wy – wx^2.\\\\)\\nIn order for this to be equal to zero, it must be true that both terms on the LHS are equal to zero. So we have:\\n–wyxz=0 and –wyxz=0.  Adding these two equations together gives us:\\n–2wyxz=0, which implies that yzx≠0. This means that either y≠0 or z≠0, but not both at once because otherwise the first equation would imply that w=1 and we have seen above that this is not true. If eithery≠0or z≠02 then taking reciprocals of each side of the equation above shows us immediately why (D) is wrong since it would give an expression with no denominator if either y or z were non-zero while all other options do have denominators in them, so it must be one of those options instead. Ify≠02then \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{yx} + \\\\frac{1}{xy} = 1/zy + 1/zx\\\\)and dividing by 2 shows us immediately why (C) is wrong since this would give a negative number where all other options are positive, but if z ≠ 02 then those exact same operations show us why (E)is right instead because they now give a positive number as expected from one of those option choices.\\""},{"source":"What was the response?

Passage:By the early 1890s he had moved away from Bavaria and, with his brother, was working in Duisburg. Together the brothers smuggled subversive anarchist literature into Germany from the Netherlands. Coming under increasing police pressure, and taking his queue from a number of other anarchist comrades in a similar predicament, early in 1892 he fled to the United States of America. On his arrival at New York he met up with the circle around Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and politically like-minded comrades from Germany. Sepp Orter discovered in himself a talent for activism, turning out to have a flair for public speaking. During 1892 he was also the editor of the New York version of , published by the \\"Radical Workers' Association\\" (\\"Radikaler Arbeiter Bund\\") and the \\"Autonomy\\" group which also numbered among its members Josef Peukert. The stay in America was cut short, however. The authorities suspected that Oerter had somehow been involved in Alexander Berkman's attempt to assassinate a wealthy businessman called Henry Clay Frick. Those suspicions appear not to have been entirely unfounded. With financial assistance from Emma Goldman, Sepp Oerter returned to Germany. He travelled via London where he arrived in October, and where the editorial group publishing \\"Autonomy\\" gave him a mission to take printed material across Belgium to the German frontier in order to effect a clandestine introduction of the anarchist propaganda to Germany. Sepp Oerter was able to complete his mission with the help of his brother Fritz who had stayed behind when Sepp had escaped to America.\\n Links: a. New York City b. Duisburg c. Emma Goldman d.

Aliens are currently studying the two planets to see if either of them are suitable for habitation. While studying the planets, they discover that both planets have the same type of atmosphere. However, there is one key difference. The difference is that the current species of animals on Blimpton emit much more chlorofluorocarbons than Jarmel's animals do. The aliens take note of this so they can report back to their bosses on what they have found.\\n\\nWhich planet's stratosphere is warmer?\\n\\nHint: There is a large area of low ozone concentration or \\"ozone hole\\" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December. The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the ozone into other gases.Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.","target":"Jarmel","rationale":"Blimpton has higher average temperatures in its stratosphere than Jarmel because the chlorofluorocarbon emissions cause damage to ozone that is meant to absorb ultraviolet radiation from the sun. With less protection, Blimpton's stratosphere receives more of this damaging UV light and thus warms up more quickly."},{"source":"Read the following article and answer the question.\\nArticle: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time.

The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \\"Cathar antipope\\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia. The same year, Ban Matthew Ninoslav abandoned an unspecified heresy, but this did not satisfy Gregory.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"How many years after Pope Honorius III preached a crusade did he repeat this?","rationale":"Here's a question for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: How many years after Pope Honorius III preached a crusade did he repeat this?"},{"source":"Read the following article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: Most children don't enjoy doing housework .

The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate.\\nShostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"...\\n\\nanswer the following question:\\n\\nWhat is the last name of the composer who was suicidal?","target":"Shostakovich","rationale":"In the text, Shostakovich is referred to multiple times by his first name Dmitry.

We can determine the minimum value for k as follows:\\n\\n1701 = 7 * 11 * 13\\n7 divides into 1701 once (it has a factor of 6 in it) so 7 must divide into \\\\((k!)\\\\) at least once.

Since 35 = 5*7 we can add one more factor of 7 and multiply by 5 to get this result:  k >= 10.   Now add one more seven and multiply by another three since 33=3*11, so now k >= 12.    Adding two more factors of seven gives us  42=2*3*7 which adds a factor \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\)to our equation since \\\\((\\\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\), giving us 49=7^2 with a total multiplicative effect on our original equation thus far of e^4 where e=\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\), or 1/16th .

With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13-9 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, Darren McFadden scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard Gabe Jackson. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by Vince Wilfork with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots. Tom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots). With the win the Patriots advanced to 2-1 and Brady won his 150th career game, 3rd most by a starting quarterback in NFL history.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"How many points were the Patriots ahead by at halftime?","rationale":"Here's an example of a question for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: How many points were the Patriots ahead by at halftime?"},{"source":"In this task, you are given an input list.

A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June.

The first church on the site was established in the 7th century by St Nidan, the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, Anglesey, but the oldest parts of the present structure, which is now closed and partly in ruins, date from the 14th century.  In about 1500 the church was enlarged by the addition of a second nave on the north side, separated from the earlier nave by an arcade of six arches.  Between 1839 and 1843 a new church was built nearby to serve the local community, partly due to the cost of repairing the old church. Much of the building was subsequently demolished, leaving only part of the western end and the central arcade.  The decision was condemned at the time by Harry Longueville Jones, a clergyman and antiquarian, who lamented the \\"melancholy fate\\" of what he called \\"one of the largest and most important [churches] in the island of Anglesey\\". Other appreciative comments have been made about the church both before and after its partial demolition.\\nAfter the new church was opened, the old church was used as a chapel for funerals for a time.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study conducted from 6 March 2014 to 3 May 2016 on infants evaluated for LOS. PCR viral panel performed on nasopharyngeal specimens among infants with clinical suspicion for RVI. Sequence analysis was performed to determine viral subtypes. Fisher's exact or χ 2 tests were done to determine the impact of RVI. RESULTS: During the 26-month study, there were 357 blood cultures obtained for LOS evaluations, 29 (8%) had a respiratory virus detected. Only 88 (25%) of infants evaluated for LOS also had clinical suspicion for a respiratory viral infection. RSV (14 of 29; 48%) was the predominant virus detected. Almost all infants (13 of 14; 93%) with RSV required increased respiratory support. Antimicrobial therapy was withheld or discontinued on most infants with a virus detected (18 of 29; 62%) and in the majority where there was no confirmed bacterial co-infection (18 of 20; 90%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of RVI in infants being evaluated for LOS is about 8%. RVI should be considered in LOS evaluation to prevent unnecessary antibiotic therapy.","target":"Incidence of respiratory viral infection in infants with respiratory symptoms evaluated for late-onset sepsis","rationale":"The title should include the most important findings of the study and the main topic.

Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it.\\nThe first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow.

She also appears in the comic book series based on the television show. Portrayed by Emma Caulfield, the character appears as a guest star in the third and fourth seasons of the show before becoming a series regular in the show's fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons.\\n\\nAnyanka arrives at Sunnydale High in 1998 (in the episode \\"The Wish\\") as a student named Anya Emerson. She's come to Sunnydale in response to the distress of Cordelia, who is upset after catching her boyfriend, Xander Harris, kissing their friend Willow. After some prompting, Cordelia states: \\"I wish that Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.\\" Anya shows her true demon face to Cordelia and says, \\"Done.\\" and the world changes. Now they're in an alternative reality in which Buffy has not come to Sunnydale and the vampire population has multiplied and gained in power. Giles meets with Cordelia before she dies and manages to discern what has happened. He subsequently summons Anyanka and destroys her necklace. As a result, Anya is made mortal again and the world returns to normal.  Caulfield said, \\"As far as I know, I don't think Joss Whedon ever intended to have Anya around for more than one episode.\\" However, Anya returns in the episode \\"Doppelgangland\\", duping Willow into assisting in a failed magical attempt to recover the necklace which was her power center, lost when Giles destroyed it to reverse the wish granted for Cordelia. When these efforts fail, she is forced to continue living as a typical high school student. Now with human feelings, she yearns to attend the school prom in spite of her abhorrence of all men; ironically, her only hope for a date is the last man she was sent to punish, Xander. Caulfield says, \\"[Whedon] found this great way to have her interact with the storylines that had developed throughout the entire [third] season.\\"  Anya develops feelings for Xander and asks him out again just before graduation. Her romantic plans are foiled when he tells her of the Mayor's plan for his own \\"Ascension\\", a transformation into pure demon, at the graduation ceremony. Anya decides to flee Sunnydale and invites Xander to join her, saying when she thinks something could happen to him, she \\"feels bad inside, like [she] might vomit\\". Xander refuses because he's got \\"friends on the line\\", and can't abandon them. She leaves without him.  Anya returns to Sunnydale early in Season Four, still infatuated with Xander. She seduces him (in the episode \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\"). Her lack of experience with people causes her to make straightforward, often tactless remarks, which soon put her at odds with other Scooby Gang members, especially Willow, who has little trust for the ex-demon. Anya's tactlessness is played both for humor and to highlight the truth in situations where others are reluctant to be frank. This is seen most poignantly in \\"The Body\\" when her inability to comprehend Buffy's mother's death leads to inappropriate remarks which at first make others angry, but then allow for catharsis and comfort.\\n\\nWhen did Anya first appear as a character?","target":"Anyanka arrives at Sunnydale High in 1998 (","rationale":"The answer is found in the first sentence of paragraph 2: Anyanka arrives at Sunnydale High in 1998 (in the episode \\"The Wish\\") as a student named Anya Emerson.

Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, downstream from the mouth of Balch Creek. Much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90 percent in the lower Columbia basin.Historic Guild's Lake, in the lower Balch Creek watershed near the Willamette River, was named for Peter Guild (pronounced guile), one of the first European American settlers in the area. In 1847, he acquired nearly 600 acres (2.4 km2) of the watershed through a donation land claim. Although variations in the spelling of Guild's Lake occur in historic newspapers, maps, and other documents, Guild's Lake has been the preferred form since the beginning of the 20th century.The creek is named for Danford Balch, who settled a 346-acre (1.40 km2) donation land claim upstream of the Guild property in 1850. After a man from a neighboring family eloped with a Balch daughter, Balch killed him with a shotgun. On October 17, 1859, at a public gallows he became the first person to be hanged by the State of Oregon.Macleay Park takes its name from Donald Macleay, a Portland merchant and real-estate developer who  acquired what had been the Balch property.

The 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m), 205 lb (93 kg) Robertson played point guard and was a 12-time All-Star, 11-time member of the All-NBA Team, and one-time winner of the MVP award in 14 professional seasons. In 1962, he became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season. In the 1970-71 NBA season, he was a key player on the team that brought the Bucks their only NBA title.\\n\\nPrior to the 1970-71 season, the Royals stunned the basketball world by trading Robertson to the Bucks for Flynn Robinson and Charlie Paulk. No reasons were officially given, but many pundits suspected head coach Bob Cousy was jealous of all the attention Robertson was getting. Robertson himself said: \\"I think he was wrong and I will never forget it.\\" The relationship between Oscar and the Royals had soured to the point that Cincinnati had also approached the Lakers and Knicks about deals involving their star player (the Knicks players who were discussed in those scenarios are unknown, but Los Angeles stated publicly that the Royals asked about Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain, with the Lakers saying they would not consider trading either star).  However, the trade proved highly beneficial for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team the last six years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, the Bucks charged to a league-best 66-16 record, including a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12-2 record in the playoffs, and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4-0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. For the first time in his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.  From a historical perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made not on a basketball court, but rather in a court of law. It was the year of the landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, an antitrust suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA-NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.  On the hardwood, the veteran Robertson still proved he was a valuable player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the 1971-72 and 1972-73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59-23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson had the chance to end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the Bucks lost in seven games. As a testament to Robertson's importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38-44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.  Robertson was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995.\\n\\nwhat team was he with before the Bucks?","target":"the Royals","rationale":"The context states that Robertson was with the \\"Cincinnati Royals\\" before going to the Bucks:\\nPrior to the 1970-71 season, the Royals stunned the basketball world by trading Robertson to the Bucks for Flynn Robinson and Charlie Paulk.

Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge.

In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately 10,000 ft (3,000 m), tundra conditions prevail.

The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.\\n\\n- Samuli \\"Skrymer\\" Ponsimaa is the guitarist in Folk Metal band Finntroll. He joined the band in 1998 following the demo Rivfader and has stayed with the band ever since. He is also an artist, and has designed all of the artwork for Finntroll, such as Cover and Booklets, Stage Scenery and Outfits, Merchandise and more. He did the coverartwork for two Glittertind albums Evige Asatro and Til Dovre Faller. He has an artwork profile on Facebook and he also work as a tattoo artist in Essen. \\nHe plays Gibson Guitars. Mostly the Gibson Les Paul. \\nIn 2009 he and fellow Finntroll member Mathias Lillmåns formed the Death Metal band Decomposter, in which he plays the guitar.\\n\\n- Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.\\n\\n- A bassist, or bass player, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone. Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop music. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands.\\n\\n- Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums.\\n\\n- Mathias \\"Vreth\\" Lillmåns is the vocalist for the Finnish folk metal band Finntroll, and has been since 2006. He is also the vocalist and the bassist for the bands Chthonian and Twilight Moon. In 2009 he and fellow Finntroll member Samuli Ponsimaa formed the death metal band DecomposteR, in which he is the vocalist and bassist.\\n\\n- Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.\\n\\n- Finntroll is a folk metal band from Helsinki, Finland. They combine elements of black metal and folk metal. Finntroll's lyrics are mostly in Swedish, the only exception being the song \\"Madon Laulu\\" on \\"Visor Om Slutet\\". Finntroll's original singer, Katla, decided to use Swedish over Finnish since he was part of a Swedish-speaking minority in Finland and the sound of the language seemed to better suit the band's \\"trollish\\" outfit. Despite several vocalist changes, this tradition has continued.\\n\\n- Ur jordens djup ( English : From the Depths of the Earth ) is the fourth full - length Finntroll album . It was released on March 28 , 2007 . The album is the first to feature vocalist Mathias Lillmåns , who replaced Tapio Wilska in 2006 . Unlike in Nattfödd , the lyrics for this album were written by the band 's original vocalist , Jan \`\` Katla '' Jämsen . This and other factors appear to contribute to a darker , more black metal feel . A music video for \`\` Nedgång '' was released in April .\\n\\n- Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war.\\n\\n- Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- Obscene Eulogy is a death/black metal band from Saint John, New Brunswick, who are most notable for having recorded with Impaled Nazarene's Mika Luttinen on vocals. Their current singer is Tapio Wilska of Finntroll.\\n\\n- Nattfödd is the third studio album by the Finnish folk metal band Finntroll. It was released on April 19, 2004 by Spinefarm Records in Finland and by Century Media outside.\\n\\n- Tapio Wilska (born 19 September 1969, in Savonlinna, Finland) is the main vocalist of the heavy metal band Sethian. He is also the ex-lead vocalist for the band Finntroll and is the current vocalist of Canadian band Obscene Eulogy. He gets his inspiration from bands like Black Sabbath, Motörhead, Dead Kennedys, Venom, Thin Lizzy and The Pixies.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'record label' with the subject 'ur jordens djup'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- album\\n - black metal\\n - english\\n - europe\\n - european union\\n - finntroll\\n - folk metal\\n - funk\\n - heavy metal music\\n - norway\\n - sole\\n - spinefarm records\\n - united kingdom","target":"spinefarm records","rationale":"spinefarm records is a record label."},{"source":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who made hubble telescope\\nSuggested answer: Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923.\\nShould I validate this answer?","target":"No","rationale":"The suggested answer provided by the automatic system is not an accurate representation of who made the telescope.

It is here that thymocytes with reactivities to self antigens are eliminated and those with specificities to 'altered' self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products are positively selected. The selections are presumably carried out on the basis of their T-cell antigen receptors (TcR). The genes of the alpha- and beta-chain T-cell antigen receptors have been cloned. A third T-cell specific gene capable of undergoing somatic rearrangement has also been identified; the role of this third gene is not known. An order of expression of gamma, beta, then alpha is found during T-cell ontogeny. But although alpha- and beta-chain messages are often functional, gamma transcripts are rarely functional in thymocytes or mature T cells. To define the sequential order of expression of these genes further and to continue the search for a possible role for the TcR gamma gene products, we investigated the expression of 'functional' alpha-, beta- and gamma-chain transcripts in young athymic mice. These mice express an undetectable amount (less than one in 8 X 10(5) spleen messages) of 'full-length' alpha- and beta-chain T-cell receptor transcripts, but an increased level of expression of 'full-length' gamma chain messages. Nucleotide sequence analysis of four gamma complementary DNAs show that all four gamma transcripts sequenced are functional. These findings suggest that gamma gene products may be important in a prethymic or extrathymic pathway and may represent a second type of T-cell recognition, possibly in a lineage in which alpha and beta genes are not used.","target":"Aging","rationale":"The abstract describes research that was done to study the expression of 'functional' alpha-, beta- and gamma-chain transcripts in young athymic mice.

Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them.\\n\\nHint: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass.","target":"sample B","rationale":"Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium, which consists of 99% U-238 and 1% U-235. Sample B is enriched uranium, so it must have a higher percentage of U-235 than sample A (which means more than 3%). Since samples C and D are both isotopes of Uranium that could be found in either sample A or B, they cannot be used to determine whether there would be less or more U-235 in one vs another. Therefore, we can conclude by looking at only this information that sample B has a higher percentage of 235U."},{"source":"Two analogies that relate objects to the associated rooms is given in the form \\"A : B.

He starts singing showtunes from West Side Story to get the attention of Ben Sobel, who previously hung up on him while attending his father's funeral. The FBI calls in Ben to see if Vitti is really insane. This appears to be the case, and the FBI approves Ben taking Vitti out of prison, into his own custody, for further therapy. On their way out in Sobel's car, Vitti reveals that he faked it. Needing some therapy himself after his father's death, a grieving Sobel talks Vitti into finding a regular job (as requested by the FBI). Vitti attempts to find a legitimate job (he tries a car dealer, a restaurant, and a jewelry store), but his rude manners and paranoia only complicate things further (which end up in him getting fired each time).\\nAt the same time, Vitti is told by de facto boss Patti LoPresti that the Rigazzi family wants him dead. He responds to this by telling the Rigazzis that he is \\"out\\" and seeking a new line of employment. He eventually finds employment working as a technical advisor on the set of a Sopranos-like mafia TV series. Meanwhile, FBI agents inform Sobel that Vitti has his former crew back together, and may be planning something major. This rouses Sobel's suspicion, and he visits Vitti. Both get caught up in a car chase with Rigazzi hitmen, which ends up with Vitti escaping. The FBI blames Sobel, and gives him 24 hours to locate Vitti.\\nAfter locating Vitti (through Sobel's son Michael, who is now working as Vitti's chauffeur), Sobel discovers Vitti is planning a big armored car heist with LoPresti as a partner. He attempts to intervene and talk Vitti out of it but Vitti proceeds and Sobel is forced to go along as well. The crew ambushes the armored car with smoke grenades, and lifts it over a fence in the midst of the confusion. They extract $20M worth of gold bullion, but LoPresti's thugs take over, revealing themselves to actually have been working for Rigazzi. Sobel, in a fit of anger, beats one of them and Vitti's men take care of the rest. They use the gold bullion to frame the Rigazzi family, leaving three Rigazzi goons locked in the armored truck suspended from the crane. This leads to the arrest of the entire Rigazzi family, and in turn, prevents a mob war.\\nSobel meets with Vitti and Jelly near bridges on the New York waterfront, and they part ways again as friends, singing another West Side Story showtune together.","target":"How much money the crew got of with?","rationale":"The correct answer is: \\"How much money the crew got of with?\\" as the question could be answered from information in the story."},{"source":"The following document has been corrupted.

This article largely addresses the free-form languages, such as C programming language and its descendants, but can be (and frequently is) applied to most other programming languages (especially those in the curly bracket family), where whitespace is otherwise insignificant. Indent style is just one aspect of programming style.\\n\\n- Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. \\n\\n- A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit.\\n\\n- A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.\\n\\n- Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm  e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology.\\n\\n- A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.\\n\\n- A bracket is a tall punctuation mark typically used in matched pairs within text, to set apart or interject other text. Used unqualified, brackets refer to different types of brackets in different parts of the world and in different contexts. The matched pair may be described as opening and closing, or left and right symbols.\\n\\n- A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.\\n\\n- Programming style is a set of rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program. It is often claimed that following a particular programming style will help programmers to read and understand source code conforming to the style, and help to avoid introducing errors.\\n\\n- A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. Such programs are sometimes known as \\"notepad\\" software, following the Microsoft Notepad.\\n\\n- A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.\\n\\n- Prettyprint ( or pretty - print ) is the application of any of various stylistic formatting conventions to text files , such as source code , markup , and similar kinds of content . These formatting conventions can adjust positioning and spacing ( indent style ) , add color and contrast ( syntax highlighting ) , adjust size , and make similar modifications intended to make the content easier for people to view , read , and understand . Prettyprinters for programming language source code are sometimes called code beautifiers or syntax highlighters .\\n\\n- Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or markup languages, such as HTML. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.\\n\\n- In computer programming, a free-form language is a programming language in which the positioning of characters on the page in program text is insignificant. Program text does not need to be placed in specific columns as on old punched card systems, and frequently ends of lines are insignificant. Whitespace characters are used only to delimit tokens, and have no other significance.\\n\\n- Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions.\\n\\n- HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\\n\\n- In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed.\\n\\n- In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.\\n\\n- A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the \\"marking up\\" of paper manuscripts, i.e., the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.\\n\\n- A programmer, computer programmer, developer, dev, coder, or software engineer is a person who writes computer software. The term \\"computer programmer\\" can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language (Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#, Java, Lisp, Python, etc.) is often prefixed to these titles, and those who work in a Web environment often prefix their titles with \\"Web\\". The term \\"programmer\\" can be used to refer to a software developer, Web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer, software engineer, computer scientist, or software analyst. However, members of these professions possess other software engineering skills, beyond programming; for this reason, the term \\"programmer\\", or \\"code monkey\\", is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory oversimplification of these other professions. This has sparked much debate amongst developers, analysts, computer scientists, programmers, and outsiders who continue to be puzzled at the subtle differences in the definitions of these occupations.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'prettyprint' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of'.

Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human.

Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness.\\nIt takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety.\\nDon’t stuff your emotions!\\nLet yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress.

It also makes written music easier to follow, since each bar of staff symbols can be read and played as a batch. Typically, a piece consists of several bars of the same length, and in modern musical notation the number of beats in each bar is specified at the beginning of the score by the time signature.

The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend.

Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade.

O. Sars , 1883 Nematoscelis microps G. O. Sars , 1883 Nematoscelis tenella G. O. Sars , 1883\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- Euphausia is the largest genus of krill, and is placed in the family Euphausiidae. There are 31 species known in this genus, including Antarctic krill (\\"Euphausia superba\\") and ice krill (\\"Euphausia crystallorophias\\") from the Southern Ocean, and North Pacific krill (\\"Euphausia pacifica\\") in the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n- Krill are small crustaceans of the order Euphausiacea, and are found in all the world's oceans. The name \\"krill\\" comes from the Norwegian word \\"\\", meaning \\"small fry of fish\\", which is also often attributed to species of fish.\\n\\n- A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'euphausiidae'.","target":"nematoscelis","rationale":"The answer is nematoscelis.\\nBased on the information above, we can infer that nematoscelis is a genus of krill and euphausiidae are one species in this genus.

Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen.

Passage 1:Alydeed was owned and raced by David Willmot's Kinghaven Farms. Racing from a base at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, at age two his best performances were wins in an allowance race at Gulfstream Park in Florida, where he equalled the track record for 6.5 furlongs, and a win in Woodbine's Victoria Stakes. At age three, Alydeed won five of his ten starts. Near the end of April 1992, he was sent to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky where he won the Derby Trial. Based on his strong performance, his handlers decided to run him in the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Preakness Stakes where he ran second to Pine Bluff. Back at Woodbine Racetrack, he won the Plate Trial Stakes then ran away from the field in the final quarter of a mile to win Canada's most prestigious race, the Queen's Plate. In the second leg of the Canadian Triple Crown series, the Prince of Wales Stakes, Alydeed was sent off as the prohibitive favorite at 1/9 odds. However, on a muddy Fort Erie Racetrack, Alydeed ran second to Benburb. Alydeed then elected to skip the third jewel of the Canadian Triple Crown opting for the Grade 1 Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course where he finished eighth to Thunder Rumble as the 8-5 favourite.\\n Passage 2:Early in the Global War on Terror, Fontes served at US Central Command J5 overseeing issues of political-military cooperation in Afghanistan. In June 2004, she was moved to Combined Forces Command - Afghanistan headquarters in Kabul and served under David Barno as the head of the CJ5 staff for political-military coordination. Her staff was responsible for keeping General Barno \\"on message\\", overseeing the policies impacting military operations, and performing liaison work with both the Afghan Ministry of Defense and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. At the end of her first year in Afghanistan and following Karl Eikenberry's assumption of command from Barno, Fontes volunteered to lead the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Tarinkot. Daniel Green, the political adviser for the PRT, reported that though some Soldiers at the PRT had initial concerns due to her gender, those worries were shortly put to rest. She had been active in engaging with the Afghan people. Green said that Fontes, then a Lieutenant Colonel, pitched in a few hundred dollars of her own money to host a lunch on the PRT for local Afghan leaders. An article in Vanity Fair relates a story that she once refused to depart a meeting with Afghan elders in Chora District under threat of small arms fire, for fear of appearing weak in the face of the Taliban. Green asserts that in early 2006, she survived the first suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack in Urozgan Province due in part to the device's failure to detonate all of the mortar shells of which it was comprised. She departed Afghanistan in May 2006 to attend the US War College, graduating in 2007. She had been promoted that year to colonel. She was subsequently assigned as the chief of the American Security Assistance Office in Pakistan.\\n Passage 3:Ohio State was the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten, and were ranked sixth in the preseason AP Poll. They began the year with six straight victories, including on the road against then-No. 14 Oklahoma and in double overtime against then-No. 8 Wisconsin, and rose to second in the AP Poll. The Buckeyes were upset by unranked Penn State in a whiteout game at Beaver Stadium on October 22. The team won its remaining regular season games, and finished conference play with an overtime victory against arch-rival and third-ranked Michigan. Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8–1, and Penn State advanced to the 2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final College Football Playoff rankings, earning them a spot in the national semi-final Fiesta Bowl against second-ranked Clemson.

And why do our eyes become narrow when we express disgust  ? According to a new research, it has something to do with survival.\\nIn a recently published paper, researchers concluded that expressions of fear and disgust changed the way human eyes gather and focus light. They argued that these changes were the result of evolutionary development and were intended to help humans survive, or at least discover, very different dangers.\\nIn order to test their hypothesis  ,researchers examined two dozen volunteer college students with standard eye-exam equipment, and asked them to show expressions of fear and dislike. It was found that when the students widened their eyes, more light was admitted and their field of vision was expanded. When they wrinkled their noses in disgust, their eyes narrowed. This had the effect of blocking out more light but focusing on a specific point.\\nAlthough some scientists have admitted that emotional expressions are intended primarily to communicate information, expressions of fear and disgust seem to perform different visual functions.\\n\\"Eye widening may help to find a potential danger that requires much attention. And this would agree with the hypothesized function of fear,\\" said researchers. \\"On the other hand, eye narrowing may help to distinguish and avoid different kinds of dangers, such as disease carriers and dirty foods. And this would agree with the hypothesized function of disgust.\\"\\nThese findings supported naturalist Charles Darwin's view that expressions are not necessarily for communication and are not arbitrary  .\\"If our expressions were arbitrary, they would show little cross-cultural relationship.\\" researchers said. \\"But actually, our expressions probably have some universal   functional principles.\\"\\nQuestion: What is the hypothesis of the research in this text?\\nOptions: A: Changes of human eyes lead to different emotional expressions.\\nB: Evolutionary development helps humans survive different dangers.\\nC: Emotional expressions affect how human eyes collect or focus light.\\nD: Evolutionary development causes people to express different feelings.","target":"C","rationale":"The text states that the hypothesis of this research is \\"emotional expressions affect how human eyes collect or focus light.\\" The findings of the study support this view.

Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved.\\nWhen my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced.\\nAs a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. \\"Animals belong in the wild,\\" is a common -- and understandable -- complaint.

The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces.

Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%. Censuses were then conducted at 10 year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921. The Malays group includes other natives of the Malay archipelago, the Europeans include Americans, the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what would now be Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555, with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total since, reaching 77.8% in 1947.

Each patient had undergone an ectropion repair of the lower eyelid that provided the specimen. The specimen studied four days after injection revealed by light microscopy scattered pigment granules within the epidermis and fine granules and small aggregates dispersed within the dermis.

No pigment particles were observed within the epidermis, but rather there were coarse clumps of granular material in the dermis. Apart from scattered mast cells, which occasionally contained fine granules, and apart from the macrophages which appeared to have ingested the pigment granules, no other acute and chronic inflammatory cells were found. Electron microscopy demonstrated that while most of the granular material had been phagocytosed by macrophages, occasional granules were found in small dispersions within the cytoplasm of mast cells and fibroblasts of the dermis.

Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. Visible light and infrared light are just a small part of the full range of electromagnetic radiation, which is called the electromagnetic spectrum. You can see the waves of the electromagnetic spectrum in the Figure 1.1. At the top of the diagram, the wavelengths of the waves are given. Also included are objects that are about the same size as the corresponding wavelengths. The frequencies and energy levels of the waves are shown at the bottom of the diagram. Some sources of the waves are also given. On the left side of the electromagnetic spectrum diagram are radio waves and microwaves. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves. They also have the least amount of energy. On the right side of the diagram are X rays and gamma rays. They have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies of all electromagnetic waves. They also have the most energy. Between these two extremes are waves that are commonly called light. Light includes infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light. The wavelengths, frequencies, and energy levels of light fall in between those of radio waves on the left and X rays and gamma rays on the right. Q: Which type of light has the longest wavelengths? A: Infrared light has the longest wavelengths. Q: What sources of infrared light are shown in the diagram? A: The sources in the diagram are people and light bulbs, but all living things and most other objects give off infrared light. \\n Question: electromagnetic waves with the greatest amount of energy are","target":"gamma rays","rationale":"The answer is gamma rays since they are the electromagnetic waves with the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies, which means they have the most energy."},{"source":"In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, causes substantial economic loss in the swine industry worldwide. Previous studies reported miRNA involvement in viral infection; however, their role in regulating PEDV infection remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulatory relationship between miRNA-221-5p and PEDV infection, finding that miR-221-5p overexpression inhibited PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner, and that silencing endogenous miR-221-5p enhanced viral replication. Our results showed that miR-221-5p directly targets the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of PEDV genomic RNA to inhibit PEDV replication, and that miR-221-5p overexpression activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling via p65 nuclear translocation, thereby upregulating interferon (IFN)-β, IFN-stimulated gene 15, and MX1 expression during CH/HBTS/2017 infection. We subsequently identified NF-κB-inhibitor α and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, negative regulators of the NF-κB pathway, as miR-221-5p targets. These results demonstrated the ability of miR-221-5p to inhibit PEDV replication by targeting the 3' UTR of the viral genome and activating the NF-κB-signaling pathway. Our findings will aid the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for PEDV infection.","target":"MicroRNA-221-5p Inhibits Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Replication by Targeting Genomic Viral RNA and Activating the NF-κB Pathway","rationale":"My suggestion is: MicroRNA-221-5p Inhibits Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Replication by Targeting Genomic Viral RNA and Activating the NF-κB Pathway."},{"source":"Two analogies that relate actions to the tools used to perform the action is given in the form \\"A : B.

They include the various marine mammals who dwell in oceans, as well as various freshwater species, such as the European otter. They are not a taxon and are not unified by any distinct biological grouping, but rather their dependence on and integral relation to aquatic ecosystems. The level of dependence on aquatic life are vastly different among species, with the Amazonian manatee and river dolphins being completely aquatic and fully dependent on aquatic ecosystems; whereas the Baikal seal feeds underwater but rests, molts, and breeds on land; and the capybara and hippopotamus are able to venture in and out of water in search of food.\\n\\n- River dolphins are a widely distributed group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water . They are an informal grouping within the group dolphin , which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea . The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae ( the Indian dolphins ) , Iniidae ( the Amazonian dolphins ) , and Pontoporiidae ( the brackish dolphins ) .

Fresh water is generally characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids. The term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water although it does include mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate springs. The term \\"sweet water\\" (from Spanish \\"agua dulce\\") has been used to describe fresh water in contrast to salt water. The term fresh water does not have the same meaning as potable water. Much of the surface fresh water and ground water is unsuitable for drinking without some form of purification because of the presence of chemical or biological contaminants.\\n\\n- Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms).\\n\\n- Cetacea are a widely distributed and diverse clade of aquatic mammals that today consists of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Cetaceans are carnivorous and finned. Most species live in the sea, some in rivers. The name is derived from the Latin \\"cetus\\" \\"whale\\" and Greek \\"ketos\\" \\"huge fish\\".\\n\\n- Oceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \\"whale\\" rather than \\"dolphin\\", such as the killer whale and the pilot whales. Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea, which also includes the porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the Monodontidae (beluga whale and narwhal). River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea.\\n\\n- The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.\\n\\n- Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.\\n\\n- Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).\\n\\n- Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals that are sometimes referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.\\n\\n- Iniidae is a family of river dolphins containing one living and four extinct genera.\\n\\n- A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\".\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'taxon rank' with 'superfamily'.","target":"river dolphin","rationale":"The paragraphs above describe that:\\n- Dolphin is a group of aquatic mammals.

He avoided the Vietnam War military draft by taking methamphetamine to fail his draft physical.

The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds.\\nThe cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves.

His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day.\\n\\nBefore he was drafted in 2004, Howard said that he wanted to use his NBA career and Christian faith to \\"raise the name of God within the league and throughout the world\\". He has stated he believes in reaching out to his community and fans and thus contributes substantially in the field of philanthropy. An avid listener of Gospel music, he attends the Fellowship of Faith Church when he is back home in Atlanta and is involved and active with the youth programs at the church. Together with his parents, Howard also established the Dwight D. Howard Foundation Inc. in 2004. The Foundation provides scholarships for students who want to attend his alma mater, Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, and grants to Lovell Elementary School and Memorial Middle School in Orlando, Florida. The Foundation also organizes summer basketball camps for boys and girls, and together with high school and college coaches and players, fellow NBA players are invited to be on hand at the camp. For his contributions in the Central Florida community, Howard received in 2005 the Rich and Helen De Vos Community Enrichment Award. Within the NBA itself, Howard has participated in several NBA \\"Read to Achieve\\" assemblies encouraging children to make reading a priority. In November 2009, the center was named one of the 10 finalists for the Jefferson Awards for Public Service, which awards athletes for their charitable work. In 2009, Howard, along with several other NBA players, joined the Hoops for St. Jude charity program benefitting the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Elsewhere, Howard appeared as a special guest on an episode of the ABC series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired April 2, 2006, in which Ty Pennington and his team built a new home and ministry offices for Sadie Holmes, who operates a social services ministry in the Orlando area. He made another appearance on the show in the October 9, 2011 episode.  Along with Sam Worthington and Jonah Hill, Howard appeared in a commercial for the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.  Howard, along with Carmelo Anthony and Scottie Pippen, also appeared in the 2013 Chinese film Amazing, a joint venture between the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation.

His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.\\nLess is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.\\nLochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....","target":"Stefan","rationale":"The context is about the life of Stefan Lochner, an important German painter of the late 15th century.

Since there are no other artists mentioned with similar names or descriptions, it can be inferred that he must have been a very influential artist who had significant impact on later northern European painters during those years as well as beyond them.\\nTherefore, answer to this question would be \\"Stefan\\", which also happens to be part of his given name: Stefan Lochner"},{"source":"In the beginning of year 1000 mount Etna had a huge volcanic eruption.

One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the imbalance of ocean mass fluxes. After the volcano eruption, evaporation over ocean becomes lower, because it is largely determined by the ocean skin temperature change. The quick response of evaporation to the surface cooling and the delayed response of river runoff to the associated lower precipitation lead to an increased sea level. About 1~2 years later, river discharge becomes less due to the reduced precipitation and less sea ice melting, which cause sea level to drop.[9]","target":"1000","rationale":"The question asks when the sea level will be higher, in year 1000 or 1002. In order to answer this correctly you need to understand that after a volcano eruption evaporation over ocean becomes lower, which increases the mean sea level 1-2 years later and then it drops again about 2 years after that due to less river discharge because of reduced precipitation and ice melting. So we can conclude from this paragraph that shortly following an volcanic erruption there is an increase followed by another decrease in global mean sea level on decadal time scale.\\nSo with all of this information we know two things: \\n1) The first direct response to the volcanic eruption is significant rise in sealevel; \\n2) This initial rise happens right around (a couple months before/after?) year"},{"source":"What was the response?

Chamberlain was of English ancestry, and could trace his family line back to twelfth century England, during the reign of King Stephen. He was the oldest of five children. It is said that he was his mother's favorite while his father was tough on him. He was very involved in his church, mostly singing in the choir. His mother encouraged him to become a preacher while his father wanted him to join the military, but he felt a reluctance towards both options. He suffered a speech impediment until shortly after graduating from Bowdoin College. He entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1848 with the help of a local tutor, professor William Hyde. Chamberlain learned to read Ancient Greek and Latin in order to pass the entrance exam. While at Bowdoin he met many people who would influence his life, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, the wife of Bowdoin professor Calvin Stowe. Chamberlain would often go to listen to her read passages from what would later become her celebrated novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. He also joined the Peucinian Society, a group of students with Federalist leanings. A member of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society and a brother of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, Chamberlain graduated in 1852.  He married Fanny Adams, cousin and adopted daughter of a local clergyman, in 1855, and they had five children, one of whom was born too prematurely to survive and two of whom died in infancy. Chamberlain studied for three additional years at Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine, returned to Bowdoin, and began a career in education as a professor of rhetoric. He eventually went on to teach every subject in the curriculum with the exception of science and mathematics. In 1861 he was appointed Professor of Modern Languages. He was fluent in nine languages other than English: Greek, Latin, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac.  Chamberlain's great-grandfathers were soldiers in the American Revolutionary War. One, Franklin Chamberlain, was a sergeant at the Siege of Yorktown. His grandfather, also named Joshua Chamberlain, was a colonel in the local militia during the War of 1812 and was court-martialed (but exonerated) for his part in the humiliating Battle of Hampden, which led to the sacking of Bangor and Brewer by British forces.

The postoperative intrauterine pregnancy rate was 85.5% among 62 patients without a history of infertility (group I), compared with 41.1% among 56 patients with a history of infertility or a previous ectopic pregnancy (group II).

She is a soprano and has a vocal range of three octaves. Turunen studied singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule fur Musik Karlsruhe. She is a professional classical lied singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which she founded with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996.\\n\\nTurunen's voice is described by critics as remarkably powerful and emotional. Sometimes it is stated that her voice is too trained or operatic for metal music, but even critics who do not like classical voices admit that her voice suits the kind of metal songs she sings unusually well.  Until the end of their collaboration, Turunen's singing was a trademark of Nightwish. She was known as the face and voice of Nightwish while bandleader Holopainen was the soul. Turunen was seen as a key to Nightwish's success. She is respected by other musicians of the metal genre and is an influence on their work; for instance, Simone Simons of Epica names her as her inspiration to study classical music and apply that vocal style to a metal band.  Turunen receives most of her media attention in Europe, especially in her home of Finland. In December 2003, she was invited by Finnish president Tarja Halonen to celebrate the Finnish Independence Day at the Presidential Palace together with other Finnish celebrities. The event is televised annually live by the state-owned broadcaster, the Finnish Broadcasting Company. In December 2007, she performed different versions of the Finnish national anthem \\"Maamme\\" (Finnish: \\"Our country\\") accompanied by the Tapiola Sinfonietta, to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Finnish independence. The concert was televised by the Finnish Broadcasting Company for 2 million Finnish viewers. In December 2013, Turunen was the invited soloist at the Christmas Peace event in the Turku Cathedral, Finland, with the presence of Finnish president Sauli Niinisto. The concert aired on Yle TV1 at the Christmas Eve. During her solo career, Turunen has sold over 100,000 certified records in Finland, which places her among the top 50 of best-selling female soloists.

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results.

With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles.\\nLaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue.\\nThe group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before.

We've asked her for money who knows how many times, I don't even know how much we owe her. For context, her parents (my daughter's great grandparents) both passed away last year. Their deaths hit MIL pretty hard, especially because they were a few months apart (3 max), and her way of coping was shopping sprees. I didn't like it from the beginning because I knew that as soon as she got her head straight she'll start bitching about how much money she doesn't have because \\n1) she has no monetary discipline\\n2) because of #1 her three sons (all adults) also have no monetary discipline\\n3) her parents had no monetary discipline\\n So because of this, everyone is broke. \\n\\nThis is all relevant in the fact that we were all hit pretty hard last year, so my husband and I promised that when we got our taxes we'd give her the majority. She got $6,000 out of roughly $10,000. A couple of days ago, maybe a week now, she hit a bump because some hardware store took money out of her account for a debt her father had left after passing. This was at the same time my husband was to pay her some bills (she's sort of our landlady). We were admittedly late by a couple hundred due work being a little slow, but we had plenty of time to give her the money before the bill was actually due.

For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do.\\nIt will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules.\\nRobots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless.\\nThe biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo .\\nOne simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation.\\nIf the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps , and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else.\\nThe most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules.

His father had emigrated from Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire and was a prominent lawyer, rancher, and (later) a Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother had emigrated from Gillingham, Kent and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the 600-acre (240 ha) Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch about fifty miles (eighty kilometers) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri River.\\n\\nFor me the really satisfying things I do are offered me, free, for nothing. Ever go out in the fall and do a little hunting? See the frost on the grass and the leaves turning? Spend a day in the hills alone, or with good companions? Watch a sunset and a moonrise? Notice a bird in the wind? A stream in the woods, a storm at sea, cross the country by train, and catch a glimpse of something beautiful in the desert, or the farmlands? Free to everybody ...  Cooper's twenty-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in October 1940. The previous year, Hemingway drew upon Cooper's image when he created the character of Robert Jordan for the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. The two shared a passion for the outdoors, and for years they hunted duck and pheasant, and skied together in Sun Valley. Both men admired the work of Rudyard Kipling--Cooper kept a copy of the poem \\"If--\\" in his dressing room--and retained as adults Kipling's sense of boyish adventure. As well as admiring Cooper's hunting skills and knowledge of the outdoors, Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona, once telling a friend, \\"If you made up a character like Coop, nobody would believe it. He's just too good to be true.\\" They saw each other often, and their friendship remained strong through the years.  Cooper's social life generally centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor. As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving. He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg.  Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, and loved the solitude of outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional \\"yup\\" and \\"shucks\\". He once said, \\"If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet.\\" According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status--never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, \\"Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him.\\"\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Gary Cooper","rationale":"The context of the text is about Gary Cooper, a renowned actor.

He was Test opening batsman from 1988 to 1999, as well as captain from 1994 to 1999, succeeding Allan Border. His predominant fielding position was first slip. He was widely regarded as an instrumental component in Australia's rise to Test cricket dominance, and his captaincy was regarded as adventurous and highly effective.\\n\\nBeginning with a century at Headingley in his First Test against England, Taylor amassed 839 runs at 83.90 in the six Tests: the second best aggregate in an Ashes series in England, behind Don Bradman's 974 runs in 1930. He occupied the crease for a total of 38 hours, more than six full days of play. The highlight of his tour was the Fifth Test at Trent Bridge when he and Geoff Marsh became the first pair to bat throughout a day's play of Test cricket in England, amassing 301 runs. Taylor made 219 in a partnership of 329, an Ashes record. He finished with 71 and 48 in the Sixth Test to overtake Neil Harvey for the third-highest series aggregate in Test history and totalled 1,669 first-class runs for the tour. Australia won the series 4-0 to regain the Ashes. However, Taylor was overlooked for selection in the ODIs.  Returning to Australia, Taylor made 1,403 first-class runs at 70.15 during the 1989-90 season, and ended 1989 with 1,219 Test runs, thus becoming the first player to better one thousand Test runs in his debut calendar year, something only matched twice since by England opener Alastair Cook and Australian Adam Voges. In Taylor's first nine Tests, Australia passed 400 in the first innings. He scored centuries in successive Tests against Sri Lanka, and against Pakistan his scores were 52 and 101 at the MCG, 77 and 59 at the Adelaide Oval and an unbeaten 101 at Sydney. Australia won both series 1-0. In just over twelve months, he had amassed 1,618 runs at 70.35. This outstanding start to his career earned Taylor nomination as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1990. At the season's end, he demonstrated his leadership abilities for the first time. Standing in as NSW captain in place of the injured Geoff Lawson for the 1989-90 Sheffield Shield final in Sydney, Taylor scored 127 and 100. NSW won by 345 runs to secure its 40th title.  A year after his Test debut, Taylor was selected to make his ODI debut, which came on Boxing Day of 1989 against Sri Lanka. He made 11 as Australia won by 30 runs. He was selected for nine of Australia's ten ODIs for the season's triangular tournament, scoring 294 runs at 32.66 with two half-centuries. His highest score of 76 came as Australia defeated Pakistan by 69 runs to clinch the finals series in Sydney. The season ended with ODI tournaments in New Zealand and Sharjah.

Peter managed to muster 27 regiments formed into three divisions (9 regiments each). Generals Adam Veyde, Avtonom Golovin and Anikita Repnin were appointed commanders of these divisions. Soldiers had to learn how to use weapons and master military formations in accordance with Veyde's Military Charter (1698).

Soon, Peter the Great had to decline their services and put inexperienced Muscovite sluzhiliye lyudi in charge of the training. In 1700, Golovin formed 8 infantry regiments and one dragoon regiment (one division). During the Battle of Narva, the Russian army was defeated by Charles XII. Golovin's division (which consisted of recruits only) was one of the first ones to flee the battlefield. Field Marshal Charles Eugène de Croÿ and all of the foreign officers in the Russian army surrendered to the Swedes. They were soon followed by Generals Yakov Dolgoruky, tsarevich Alexander Imeretinsky, Avtonom Golovin and Ivan Buturlin, who had decided to capitulate, as well. As a result, almost all of the commanding officers were taken prisoners and the Swedes captured all of the Russian artillery, which Peter the Great had been assembling piece by piece from all over Russia. Golovin was taken to Stockholm and remained there for the next 18 years. The tsar was only able to exchange him in 1718. In 1719 and 1720, Golovin took part in the structuralization of the Russian army. \\n Passage 2:Nick Payne arrives in town after a shipwreck. Soon, he is romancing Brooke Logan. This eventually puts him at odds with her fiancée, Ridge Forrester. Their rivalry is exacerbated when his mother, Jacqueline Payne, reveals to Nick that he is the son of his employer, billionaire shipping magnate Massimo Marone making him Ridge's half-brother. Brooke chooses to marry Ridge. They go on their honeymoon in South America, where Ridge is kidnapped by a group of thugs working for Sheila Carter, a criminal who killed Ridge's wife Taylor Hayes. While saving Ridge, Brooke and Nick end up also being held captive by Sheila, demanding gold from Massimo. Ridge falls into a furnace and is presumed dead. While grieving, Brooke and Nick have sex. It is later revealed that Ridge is alive. Brooke realizes she is pregnant and is unsure if Ridge or Nick is the father. A DNA test reveals Nick is the father but months its later revealed that Ridge is actually the father. Brooke nearly marries Nick but the wedding is stopped by Ridge. Nick later had a brief romance with Ridge's half-sister, Felicia Forrester. She returned to L.A with a son called Dominick. Later, Nick begins to romance Bridget Forrester. They get married (a small interruption in their ceremony which reveals that Taylor Hayes was alive stops the initial wedding) at the Forrester Mansion. Bridget becomes pregnant, but finds out that Nick and her own mother, Brooke, had begun an affair. She faked an abortion. Nick and Bridget's stillborn baby Nicole was born in early 2006. They split up soon after. Nick, wanting Brooke back, stopped her wedding to Ridge and succeeded. Brooke and Nick finally married soon afterward. On one of the fashion show television shows Ridge purposely gave Brooke a scandalizing kiss causing Nick to lose it. Ridge continues his constant sexual advances to Brooke to try to break up Nick and Brooke and decides to put Brooke's sister Donna Logan on as lead model for Brooke's Bedroom to make Brooke jealous. Brooke leaves Nick in their bedroom in a huff when she sees Donna on television scantily clad and representing Brooke's Bedroom and goes to Ridge's house to confront him about it. Nick later slept with Bridget. Also during this time, Jackie falls off the staircase at the Forrester mansion and falsely claims that Stephanie pushed her. Nick blackmails Eric Forrester and the rest of the Forresters into selling him Forrester Creations or Stephanie will face charges. Brooke, furious at Nick's treatment of the Forresters, sells him her stock as well, ends her marriage to Nick and returns to Ridge.\\n Passage 3:The death of his father, Dom Luiz de Mello, drove him early to soldiering, and having joined a contingent for the Flanders war, he found himself in the historic storm of January 1627, when the pick of the Portuguese fleet suffered shipwreck in the Bay of Biscay. He spent much of the next ten years of his life in military routine work in the Iberian Peninsula, varied by visits to the court of Madrid, where he contracted a friendship with the Spanish poet Quevedo and earned the favor of the powerful minister Olivares. In 1637 the latter despatched him in company with the conde de Linhares on a mission to pacify the revolted city of Évora, and on the same occasion the duke of Braganza, afterwards King John IV (for whom he acted as confidential agent at Madrid), employed him to satisfy Philip III of Portugal of his loyalty to the Philippine Dynasty.","target":"2","rationale":"The given question asks for the age of Nick's dad.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.  There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath.  Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom.  This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses.
