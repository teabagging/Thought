They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure ‚Äì that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.\\n\\nParagraph: Dan studied genetic engineering.

The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways.

While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success.\\nM.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine.

By 1810, the population had grown to 80,000 before declining dramatically between 1829 and 1842 during the reigns of Radama I and especially Ranavalona I. Because of a combination of war, forced labor, disease and harsh measures of justice, the population of Imerina fell from 750,000 to 130,000 during this period. In the final years of the Kingdom of Imerina, the population had recovered to between 50,000 and 75,000; most of the population were slaves who were largely captured in provincial military campaigns. In 1950, Antananarivos population was around 175,000. By the late 1990s the population of the metropolitan area had reached 1.4 million, and ‚Äì while the city itself now has a population (2013) of about 1,300,000 ‚Äì with suburbs lying outside the city limits it had grown to almost 2.1 million in 2013.

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form.\\n\\nCell machines have large tool magazines to carry enough tools to do all of the various operations on each of the different parts, large worktables or the ability to change worktables, and special provisions in the controller for data inputs from other CNC machines. Attached to the side of the machine is a magazine of different tools. A transfer arm, sometimes called the tool bar, removes a tool from the machine, places it into the magazine, selects a different tool from the magazine, and returns it to the machine through instructions in the program. The fourth category covers modern machine tools and processes for machining ultrahard metals not machinable by older methods. 1  Machine tools that form parts by removing metal chips from a workpiece include lathes, shapers and planers, drilling machines, milling machines, grinders, and power saws. Modern machine tools cut or form parts to tolerances of plus or minus one ten-thousandth of an inch (0.0025 millimetre). In special applications, precision lapping machines can produce parts that are within plus or minus two millionths of an inch (0.00005 millimetre). The motions that are used in machine tools are called axis, and are referred to as X (usually left to right), Y (usually front to back), and Z (up and down). The work-table may also be rotated in the horizontal or vertical plane, creating a fourth axis of motion. After the advent of the steam engine, material goods were produced by power-driven machines that could only be manufactured by machine tools. Machine tools (capable of producing dimensionally accurate parts in large quantities) and jigs and fixtures (for holding the work and guiding the tool) were the indispensable innovations that made mass production and interchangeable parts realities in the 19th century. Machine tool: Machine tool, any stationary power-driven machine that is used to shape or form parts made of metal or other materials. The shaping is accomplished in four general ways: (1) by cutting excess material in the form of chips from the part; (2) by shearing the material; (3) by squeezing metallic parts to the desired shape; and (4) by applying electricity, ultrasound, or corrosive chemicals to the material. Welding the base. 1  1 The base of the machine is either cast or welded together. It is then heat treated to remove casting or welding stresses and to normalize the metal for machining. 2  2 The ways are ground flat, bolted, and pinned to the base. The controller. 1  5 The computer, or controller, is an electronic assembly separate from the rest of the machine. It has a climate-controlled enclosure mounted on the side of the frame or in an operator's console. 2  6 The assembled machine is test run for accuracy. In particular, machine-driven tools became necessary to manufacture the parts for the machines that now made goods formerly produced by hand. Most common machine tools were designed by the middle of the 19th century.

Passage 1:The piezoelectric properties of quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator was built by Walter G. Cady in 1921. In 1923, D. W. Dye at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK and Warren Marrison at Bell Telephone Laboratories produced sequences of precision time signals with quartz oscillators. In 1927, the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J.¬†W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories. The next 3 decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time standards in laboratory settings; the bulky delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their use elsewhere. In 1932 a quartz clock was able to measure tiny variations in the rotation rate of the Earth over periods as short as a few weeks. In Japan in 1932, Issac Koga developed a crystal cut that gave an oscillation frequency with greatly reduced temperature dependence. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the US on quartz clocks between the 1930s and the 1960s, after which it transitioned to atomic clocks. The wider use of quartz clock technology had to await the development of cheap semiconductor digital logic in the 1960s. The revised 14th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica stated that quartz clocks would probably never be affordable enough to be used domestically.\\n Passage 2:On September 8, 2019, Minshew made his NFL debut against the Kansas City Chiefs when starter Nick Foles was taken out of the game due to a shoulder injury. He completed 22 of 25 passes for 275 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the 40‚Äì26 loss. Minshew's pass completion percentage of 88% is the highest of any player making his debut in NFL history (minimum 15 pass attempts, since at least 1950), and also the highest single-game pass completion percentage in Jaguars history. Minshew was named the starter going forward after it was revealed that Foles had suffered a broken clavicle. During Week 2 against the Houston Texans, Minshew finished with 213 passing yards and a touchdown along with 56 rushing yards as the Jaguars lost 13‚Äì12. In Week 3, against the Tennessee Titans on Thursday Night Football, he earned his first victory as a professional. He passed for 204 yards and two touchdowns in the 20‚Äì7 victory. In Week 4, against the Denver Broncos, he passed for 213 yards and two touchdowns in the 26‚Äì24 victory. Late in the game, he engineered a drive that helped set up the Jaguars' game-winning field goal by Josh Lambo. During Week 5 against the Carolina Panthers, Minshew finished with 374 passing yards and two touchdowns as the Jaguars lost 27‚Äì34. After a Week 6 loss to the New Orleans Saints and a Week 7 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 279 passing yards and three passing touchdowns in a 29‚Äì15 victory over the New York Jets. During Week 9 against the Texans at Wembley Stadium, Minshew finished with 309 passing yards and 2 interceptions as the Jaguars lost 3‚Äì26. Days later, it was announced that Minshew would resume the backup role after Foles returned from his collar bone injury.\\n Passage 3:Having played for the Surrey Second XI in 1934 and 1935 in the Minor Counties Championship, Owen joined Durham following World War II. He made his debut for the county in the Minor Counties Championship against the Yorkshire Second XI. He played Minor counties cricket for Durham from 1947 to 1955, making 59 appearances for the county. He made a single first-class appearance for the Minor Counties against Kent in 1951. In this match, he was dismissed in the Minor Counties first-innings by Brian Edrich for 14 runs, while in their second-innings (in which they followed-on) he scored 12 runs before being dismissed by the same bowler. In Kent's only innings, he took the wicket of Dicky Mayes for the cost of 33 runs from 14 overs. Kent went on to win the match by an innings and 10 runs.","target":"2","rationale":"Passage 1 talks about the history of quartz, and we are told that it is used in clocks.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things we did is rent a boat and did some island hoping!

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, $8,033/ha and $13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.\\n\\nThe extensive grazing in Tibet lead to carbon and nitrogen loss, subject to desertification, while Nepal adopted a different approach to food production, putting nature and biodiversity first.\\n\\nWhich country experiences more biodiversity problems?","target":"Tibet","rationale":"The passage provides details about the differences in land management between Nepal and Tibet, specifically discussing that while the extensive grazing of livestock on Tibetan plains has led to carbon and nitrogen loss, subjecting the region to desertification, Nepal is likely experiencing less biodiversity problems because it puts nature and biodiversity first.

One group 7 metal (Mn) is usually combined with iron in an alloy called ferromanganese, which has been used since 1856 to improve the mechanical properties of steel by scavenging sulfur and oxygen impurities to form MnS and MnO. Technetium is named after the Greektechnikos, meaning ‚Äúartificial,‚Äù because all its isotopes are radioactive. One isotope, 99mTc (m for metastable), has become an important biomedical tool for imaging internal organs. (For more information on biomedical imaging, see Chapter 20 \\"Nuclear Chemistry\\", Section 20.5 \\"Applied Nuclear Chemistry\\". ) Because of its scarcity, Re is one of the most expensive elements, and its applications are limited. It is, however, used in a bimetallic Pt/Re catalyst for refining high-octane gasoline. All three group 7 elements have seven valence electrons and can form compounds in the +7 oxidation state. Once again, the lightest element exhibits multiple oxidation states. Compounds of Mn in oxidation states ranging from ‚àí3 to +7 are known, with the most common being +2 and +4 (Figure 23.5 \\"Compounds of Manganese in Oxidation States +2 to +7\\"). In contrast, compounds of Tc and Re in the +2 oxidation state are quite rare. Because the electronegativity of Mn is anomalously low, elemental manganese is unusually reactive. In contrast, the chemistry of Tc is similar to that of Re because of their similar size and electronegativity, again a result of the lanthanide contraction. Due to the stability of the half-filled 3d5 electron configuration, the aqueous Mn3+ ion, with a 3d4 valence electron configuration, is a potent oxidant that is able to oxidize water. It is difficult to generalize about other oxidation states for Tc and Re because their stability depends dramatically on the nature of the compound.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing.

Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847.

Serum, subcutaneous adipose tissue, wound drainage, and urine were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for cefamandole and pharmacokinetic parameters from the intraoperative period were compared to those obtained postoperatively. Total body clearance was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) postoperatively (297 ml/min) than intraoperatively (254 ml/min). Volume changes were unpredictable but the elimination rate constant tended to increase postoperatively. Renal clearance and percentage of urinary recovery were significantly increased (p less than 0.01) postoperatively. The patients had a mean (+/- SD) volume of the central compartment of 10.3 (+/- 2.3) L, volume at steady state of 18.3 (+/- 3.9) L, and elimination rate constant of 1.67 (+/- 0.63) h-1.

Mean wound drainage concentrations ranged between 10 and 12 micrograms/ml during a dosing interval and dropped to 7 micrograms/ml 12 hours after the last dose. Intraoperative dosing of cefamandole is required to maintain subcutaneous adipose tissue concentrations greater than 1 microgram/g during procedures longer than three hours in morbidly obese patients.

At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios,  in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him \\"just a little wear on [his] tape heads\\". While completing the early recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments, except drums, himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989). The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.Reznor coined the name \\"Nine Inch Nails\\" because it \\"abbreviated easily\\", rather than for \\"any literal meaning\\".

Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes.

In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all.

Specific ICYP binding in a crude, high-yield membrane preparation derived from endomyocardial biopsy tissue was high (specificity greater than 90%), of high affinity (KD around 20 pM), saturable and stereospecific for the (-) vs the (+) isomer of isoproterenol. Subjects with mild-moderate and severe biventricular dysfunction had respective decreases in beta-adrenergic receptor density of 38.2% and 57.7% when normalization methods were averaged, with no significant differences in ICYP dissociation constant. A subgroup of subjects was subdivided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into those with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF less than 0.50 greater than 0.40) and severe heart failure (LVEF less than 0.20) and given graded sequential infusions of dobutamine and calcium gluconate. Those with severe cardiac dysfunction had marked impairment of the dobutamine dP/dt and stroke work index response, whereas these responses to calcium did not differ in the two groups. These data indicate that in the intact human heart endomyocardial biopsy may be used for direct analysis of beta-adrenergic receptors, heart failure-associated myocardial beta-adrenergic down-regulation begins with mild-moderate ventricular dysfunction, reduction in myocardial beta-receptor density is related to degree of heart failure, and beta-receptor down-regulation is associated with pharmacologically specific impairment of the beta-agonist-mediated contractile response.","target":"Assessment of the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway in the intact failing human heart: progressive receptor down-regulation and subsensitivity to agonist response","rationale":"The abstract describes how the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway was assessed in the intact human heart, and it details the methods used to test this pathway and its effects on heart function.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swan√∂. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, √Ökerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When √Ökerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons.

He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and J√∏rgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (K√∏benhavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens W√∂ldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings.\\nThe Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra.

The conviction resulted in the suspension of Monk's cabaret card, the permit required by performers in New York for work in nightclubs. Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s. Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, led an appeal on the pianist's behalf in front of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to have his card restored. Colomby argued to the SLA that Monk was \\"a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician\\".In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, prompting Colomby to consider the Five Spot Caf√© in New York City's East Village. \\"I wanted to find a place that was small\\", he later said. \\"I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out.\\" Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in the reinstatement of his cabaret card and his employment at the Five Spot Caf√©. In his first stable job in years, Monk helped transform the small bar into one of the city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of the pianist's music. With the residency, he had finally found jazz stardom after twenty years of career struggles and obscurity.Monk began his first stint at the venue in July 1957, with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group.

For about 3 billion years, most organisms were microscopic, and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life. In 2008, fossils of macroorganisms were discovered and named as the Francevillian biota. Although bacterial fossils exist, such as stromatolites, their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny, and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage. Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the Archaea. This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly reduced form, e.g. in ancient \\"amitochondrial\\" protozoa).

Philadelphia's surprising 23-7 Christmas Day victory over the Dallas Cowboys was broadcast on national television and clinched a playoff spot. Jeff Garcia, who outshined fellow backup-turned starting quarterback Tony Romo, led the Eagles to scores on four of their first five possessions. Capping off their first drive, which took 7:12 off the clock, Garcia hit tight end Matt Schobel for a 25-yard touchdown. Cowboys' return man Miles Austin fumbled the ensuing kickoff to Quintin Mikell. However, Dallas cornerback Anthony Henry intercepted Garcia and the Cowboys drove to the Eagles' 1-yard line. From there, the Philadelphia defense stuffed Dallas goal-line back Marion Barber III on three straight plays. The ball turned over on downs and Garcia promptly found Dont&#233; Stallworth for a 39-yard gain. The drive finished with a David Akers field goal and the Eagles led 10-0. Romo and the Cowboys responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, who only caught two passes for 23 yards on the game. With only&#160;:29 seconds left in the half, Garcia got the Eagles into field goal range, and David Akers connected on a 45-yarder to make it 13-7 as time expired. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Garcia beat a Dallas blitz and completed a 65-yard catch and run to L.J. Smith. Philadelphia finished the drive with another field goal and it was 16-7. Early in the fourth quarter, Brian Dawkins made an over the shoulder interception in front of Owens in the end zone. On a 6:57 drive that included ten running plays and broke the Cowboys' backs, Correll Buckhalter pounded it in from one yard out, increasing the lead to 23-7. Romo would throw another interception, this one to Lito Sheppard, and the Eagles' domination of the Dallas offense continued for the rest of the game. The Eagles ran the ball a whopping 42 times for 204 yards (with Brian Westbrook accounting for 122 of those yards), while Garcia and the passing game gained 238 yards. The defense recorded three sacks in addition to the two interceptions and held Dallas to a meager 201 total yards on their own turf. Philadelphia clinches a playoff berth, and now suddenly controls the NFC East and can win the division with a win over the Atlanta Falcons or a Dallas loss.

Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants.\\n\\n- The Florida Panhandle, Northwest Florida, or West Florida, an informal, unofficial term for the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Florida, is a strip of land roughly 200 miles long and 50 to 100 miles wide (320¬†km by 80 to 160¬†km), lying between Alabama on the north and the west, Georgia also on the north, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. Its eastern boundary is arbitrarily defined. The terms West Florida and Northwest Florida are today generally synonymous with the Panhandle, although historically West Florida was the name of a British colony (17631783), later a Spanish colony (17831821), both of which included modern-day Florida west of the Apalachicola River as well as portions of what are now Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- The Timucua were a Native American people who lived in Northeast and North Central Florida and southeast Georgia. They were the largest indigenous group in that area and consisted of about 35 chiefdoms, many leading thousands of people. The various groups of Timucua spoke several dialects of the Timucua language. At the time of European contact, the territory occupied by speakers of Timucuan dialects occupied about , and was home to between 50,000 and 200,000 Timucuans. It stretched from the Altamaha River and Cumberland Island in present-day Georgia as far south as Lake George in central Florida, and from the Atlantic Ocean west to the Aucilla River in the Florida Panhandle, though it reached the Gulf of Mexico at no more than a couple of points.\\n\\n- The bobcat (\\"Lynx rufus\\") is a North American cat that appeared during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO). Containing 12 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico, including most of the contiguous United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction (\\"extirpation\\") by coyotes and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized \\"Lynx\\" genus. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.\\n\\n- Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit (\\"Oryctolagus cuniculus\\"), cottontail rabbits (genus \\"Sylvilagus\\"; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (\\"Pentalagus furnessi\\", an endangered species on Amami shima, Japan). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. The male is called a \\"buck\\" and the female is a \\"doe\\"; a young rabbit is a \\"kitten\\" or \\"kit\\". \\n\\n- The Ribault Club is an historic building on Fort George Island near Jacksonville, Florida. It is now home to the Fort George Island Visitor Center. The building was designed in a Colonial Revival architecture style and is credited to Maurice Fatio and Mellen Clark Greeley. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 2000 and is located on Fort George Road. It was built in 1928 for winter recreation and is considered a legacy of Fort George Island's resort era. Winter recreational opportunities included golf, tennis, hunting, fishing, and yachting. The building is listed as a Historic Landmark by the City of Jacksonville. It became part of the Fort George Island Cultural State Park in 1989.\\n\\n- Little Talbot Island State Park is a Florida State Park located on Little Talbot Island, northeast of Jacksonville on State Road A1A. The park covers the entire island. Big Talbot Island State Park lies to the immediate north. The park contains maritime forests, dunes, and salt marshes on the western side of the island. Wild life includes river otters, marsh rabbits, bobcats, and a variety of native and migrating birds. Activities include camping, fishing, hiking, swimming, canoeing, nature watching and surfing. Erosion on Big Talbot Island, coupled with sand deposition on Little Talbot, have resulted in Little Talbot Island becoming the larger of the two Talbot Islands.\\n\\n- Fort George Island State Cultural Site is a Florida State Park located on Fort George Island , about three miles ( 5 km ) south of Little Talbot Island State Park on SR A1A . It is home to the Ribault Inn Club , constructed in 1928 as a winter resort and now used as a visitor 's center . The 46,000 - acre ( 190 km2 ) Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve , in Jacksonville , Florida is nearby . Fort George has the highest point along the Atlantic coast south of Sandy Hook , New Jersey , and contains Timucua oyster shell mounds . The park is part of the Talbot Islands GEOpark complex . The park contains several distinct periods in human history . During the early historical period Fort George Island was known as Alicamani . It was the location of the village of Alicamani , a major village of the Timucua chiefdom known as the Saturiwa . Timucua influence is noted by the presence of middens , large mounds that are compiled of massive middens or shell mounds filled with discarded food byproducts . On Fort George Island , the shells were primarily oysters . The island was later home to the Spanish mission of San Juan del Puerto , the primary mission to the Saturiwa . Under British rule in 1765 , colonists developed a plantation on the island . It is now known as Kingsley Plantation , after Zephaniah Kingsley , who held it for 25 years . The main house , kitchen and numerous slave quarters have survived . Activities include off - road bicycling , hiking , boating , canoeing , kayaking , and fishing . Amenities include a 4.4 - mile ( 7.1 km ) - long loop bicycle trail , boat ramp , a 3 - mile ( 4.8 km ) hiking / biking trail , and a beach . The park is open from 8:00 am until sundown year round .\\n\\n- Timucua is a language isolate formerly spoken in northern and central Florida and southern Georgia by the Timucua people. Timucua was the primary language used in the area at the time of Spanish colonization in Florida. Linguistic and archaeological studies suggest that it may have been spoken from around 2000 BC. Differences among the nine or ten Timucua dialects were slight, and appeared to serve mostly to delineate tribal boundaries. Some linguists suggest that the Tawasa of what is now northern Alabama may have spoken Timucua, but this is disputed.\\n\\n- Cumberland Island is one of the Sea Islands of the southeastern United States and is the largest in terms of continuously exposed land. It is located on the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the U.S. state of Georgia and is part of Camden County, Georgia (30¬∞51N, 81¬∞27W). Cumberland Island constitutes the westernmost point of shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean in the United States. The island is long, with an area of 36,415 acres (147.37¬†km or 56.25 square miles), including of marsh, mudflats, and tidal creeks. There is no bridge to the island; most visitors reach the island by the Cumberland Ferry from St. Marys.\\n\\n- Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area.

PDPN is expressed by lymphatic endothelial and fibroblastic reticular cells and promotes blood-lymph separation during development by activating the C-type lectin receptor, CLEC-2, on platelets. Here, we describe a role for CLEC-2 in the morphodynamic behavior and motility of DCs. CLEC-2 deficiency in DCs impaired their entry into lymphatics and trafficking to and within lymph nodes, thereby reducing T cell priming. CLEC-2 engagement of PDPN was necessary for DCs to spread and migrate along stromal surfaces and sufficient to induce membrane protrusions. CLEC-2 activation triggered cell spreading via downregulation of RhoA activity and myosin light-chain phosphorylation and triggered F-actin-rich protrusions via Vav signaling and Rac1 activation. Thus, activation of CLEC-2 by PDPN rearranges the actin cytoskeleton in DCs to promote efficient motility along stromal surfaces.","target":"Podoplanin-Rich Stromal Networks Induce Dendritic Cell Motility via Activation of the C-type Lectin Receptor CLEC-2","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nPodoplanin-Rich Stromal Networks Induce Dendritic Cell Motility via Activation of the C-type Lectin Receptor CLEC-2\\n \\nThe title should provide evidence for stromal networks inducing DC motility and highlight the role of PDPN in this process.

I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday.

Success came in 1897 when the German chemist Eduard Buechner ground up yeast, extracted a juice from them, then found to his amazement that this \`\`dead'' liquid would ferment a sugar solution, forming carbon dioxide and alcohol much like living yeasts. Buechner's results are considered to mark the birth of biochemistry. The \`\`unorganized ferments'' behaved just like the organized ones.

Giuliani is of Tuscan origins from his father side, as his paternal grandparents (Rodolfo and Evangelina Giuliani) were born in Montecatini, Tuscany, Italy. He was raised a Roman Catholic. Harold Giuliani, a plumber and a bartender, had trouble holding a job, and was convicted of felony assault and robbery, serving time in Sing Sing.\\n\\nSeveral of Giuliani's appointees to head City agencies became defendants in criminal proceedings.  In 2000, Giuliani appointed 34-year-old Russell Harding, the son of Liberal Party of New York leader and longtime Giuliani mentor Raymond Harding, to head the New York City Housing Development Corporation, although Harding had neither a college degree nor relevant experience. In 2005, Harding pleaded guilty to defrauding the Housing Development Corporation and to possession of child pornography. He was sentenced to five years in prison. Russell Harding committed suicide in 2012.  In a related matter, Richard Roberts, appointed by Giuliani as Housing Commissioner and as chairman of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, pleaded guilty to perjury after lying to a grand jury about a car that Harding bought for him with City funds.  Giuliani was a longtime backer of Bernard Kerik, who started out as a NYPD detective driving for Giuliani's campaign. Giuliani appointed him as the Commissioner of the Department of Correction and then as the Police Commissioner. Giuliani was also the godfather to Kerik's two youngest children. After Giuliani left office, Kerik was subject to state and federal investigations resulting in his pleading guilty in 2006, in a Bronx Supreme Court, to two unrelated ethics violations. Kerik was ordered to pay $221,000 in fines. Kerik then pleaded guilty in 2009, in a New York district court, to eight federal charges, including tax fraud and false statements, and on February 18, 2010, he was sentenced to four years in federal prison.

Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Vel√°zquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Vel√°zquez masterpieces,...","target":"Bacon","rationale":"The article is about a person named Francis Bacon.

He was soon performing in concerts in private homes. The Times critic reported after one such appearance that Grainger's playing \\"revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight\\".  In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours ‚Äì he termed the relationship a \\"love-serve job\\".

In October of that year he toured Britain in a concert party with Adelina Patti, the Italian-born opera singer. Patti was greatly taken by the young pianist and prophesied a glorious career for him. The following year he met the German-Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni. Initially the two men were on cordial terms (Busoni offered to give Grainger lessons free of charge) and, as a result, Grainger spent part of the 1903 summer in Berlin as Busoni's pupil.  However, the visit was not a success; as Bird notes, Busoni had expected \\"a willing slave and adoring disciple\\", a role Grainger was not willing to fulfill.

There were 114 males and 30 females with a mean age of 28.6 years. The total time of followup was 8,810 patient months with a mean followup of 61 months (range, 12-144 months). Indications for splenectomy were blunt trauma, 111 patients; penetrating trauma, six patients; and intra-operative injury, 27 patients. During the followup to date, 15 late major septic complications requiring hospitalization have occurred in 13 patients (9%). Fulminant pneumococcal sepsis resulted in the death of a 27-year-old male, 3 years after splenectomy. Septicemia occurred in four patients, pneumonia in five, abscess in two, infection of a prosthetic heart valve in one, meningitis in one, and fever of unknown origin in one. All but two of these infections were due to encapsulated organisms. Minor septic complications occurred in 44 patients (30%), and consisted of infections which required outpatient medical care. Major late septic complications occurred more frequently following incidental splenectomy than following splenectomy for blunt or penetrating trauma (18.5% and 5.9% respectively; p less than 0.05). The mortality from major septic complications in this series (7%) is lower than previously reported by other investigators (30-80%). Our data suggest that adults undergoing splenectomy for trauma are at an increased risk of developing late major septic complications. This risk is significant enough to warrant attempts at splenic salvage, especially when injury is incidental to an elective operative procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data and measurements such as study population size (144 patients), mean age (28.6 years old), total time of followup (8,810 patient months) and mean followup (61 months).

He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth century modern synthesis. He was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935-1942), the first Director of UNESCO, a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund and the first President of the British Humanist Association. Huxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television.\\n\\nHuxley's humanism came from his appreciation that mankind was in charge of its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need for a sense of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: \\"The critical point in the evolution of man... was when he acquired the use of [language]... Man's development is potentially open... He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which... largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change\\". Both Huxley and his grandfather gave Romanes Lectures on the possible connection between evolution and ethics. (see evolutionary ethics) Huxley's views on god could be described as being that of an agnostic atheist.  Huxley had a close association with the British rationalist and secular humanist movements. He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1927 until his death, and on the formation of the British Humanist Association in 1963 became its first President, to be succeeded by AJ Ayer in 1965. He was also closely involved with the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Many of Huxley's books address humanist themes. In 1962 Huxley accepted the American Humanist Association's annual \\"Humanist of the Year\\" award.  Huxley also presided over the founding Congress of the International Humanist and Ethical Union and served with John Dewey, Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann on the founding advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Julian Huxley","rationale":"The paragraph is about Julian Huxley and his work.

Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis.\\n\\n- Mining is extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth usually from an orebody, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposits. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.\\n\\n- A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapon). Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (\\"atomic\\") bomb released the same amount of energy as approximately . The first thermonuclear (\\"hydrogen\\") bomb test released the same amount of energy as approximately .\\n\\n- The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .\\n\\n- Knapping is the shaping of flint, chert, obsidian or other conchoidal fracturing stone through the process of lithic reduction to manufacture stone tools, strikers for flintlock firearms, or to produce flat-faced stones for building or facing walls, and flushwork decoration. The original Germanic term \\"knopp\\" meant strike, shape, or work, so it could theoretically have referred equally well to making a statue or dice. Modern usage is more specific, referring almost exclusively to the hand-tool pressure-flaking process pictured.\\n\\n- Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.\\n\\n- Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of science focusing on genomes. A genome is a complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism, and as such genomics is a branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes. Genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of genes, which direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. Proteins in turn make up body structures like organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. If a cell's DNA is mutated, an abnormal protein may be produced, which can disrupt the body's usual processes and lead to a disease such as cancer. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics is the study of genes, their functions, and related techniques, such as applications of recombinant DNA, DNA sequencing methods, and bioinformatics to sequence, assemble, and analyze the function and structure of genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research to understand even the most complex biological systems such as the brain. The field includes efforts to determine the entire DNA sequence of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping. The field also includes studies of intragenomic phenomena such as heterosis, epistasis, pleiotropy and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome. Research carried out into single genes does not generally fall into the definition of genomics unless the aim of this genetic, pathway, and functional information analysis is to elucidate its effect on, place in, and response to the entire genomes networks.\\n\\n- Systems biology is the computational and mathematical modeling of complex biological systems. An emerging engineering approach applied to biological scientific research, systems biology is a biology-based inter-disciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach (holism instead of the more traditional reductionism) to biological research. Particularly from year 2000 onwards, the concept has been used widely in the biosciences in a variety of contexts. For example, the Human Genome Project is an example of applied systems thinking in biology which has led to new, collaborative ways of working on problems in the biological field of genetics. One of the outreaching aims of systems biology is to model and discover emergent properties, properties of cells, tissues and organisms functioning as a system whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques which fall under the remit of systems biology. These typically involve metabolic networks or cell signaling networks.\\n\\n- METeOR (Metadata Online Registry), Australias repository for national metadata standards for health, housing and community services statistics and information.

METeOR was developed to store, manage and disseminate metadata in the Australian health, community services and housing assistance sectors.\\n\\n- The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.\\n\\n- An arrowhead is a tip, usually sharpened, added to an arrow to make it more deadly or to fulfill some special purpose. The earliest arrowheads were made of stone and of organic materials; as human civilization progressed other materials were used. Arrowheads are important archaeological artifacts; they are a subclass of projectile points. Modern enthusiasts still \\"produce over one million brand-new spear and arrow points per year\\".\\n\\n- A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research. Today there are about 450 nuclear power reactors that are used to generate electricity in about 30 countries around the world.\\n\\n- Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.\\n\\n- In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).\\n\\n- In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on ¬†or to heat¬† the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.\\n\\n- An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100¬†picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).\\n\\n- The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international scientific research project with the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and of identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome from both a physical and a functional standpoint. It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project. After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the US government when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete in 2003. Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside of government by the Celera Corporation, or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, and China.\\n\\n- A projectile is any object thrown into space (empty or not) by the exertion of a force. Although any object in motion through space (for example a thrown baseball) may be called a projectile, the term more commonly refers to a ranged weapon. Mathematical equations of motion are used to analyze projectile trajectory.\\n\\n- The Spallation Neutron Source ( SNS ) is an accelerator - based neutron source facility that provides the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and industrial development . Each year , this facility hosts hundreds of researchers from universities , national laboratories , and industry , who conduct basic and applied research and technology development using neutrons . SNS is part of Oak Ridge National Laboratory , which is managed by UT - Battelle for the United States Department of Energy ( DOE ) . SNS is a DOE Office of Science user facility , and it is open to scientists and researchers from all over the world .\\n\\n- A neutron source is any device that emits neutrons, irrespective of the mechanism used to produce the neutrons. Neutron source devices are used in physics, engineering, medicine, nuclear weapons, petroleum exploration, biology, chemistry and nuclear power.\\n\\n- Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is an American multiprogram science and technology national laboratory managed for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) by UT-Battelle. ORNL is the largest science and\\nenergy national laboratory in the Department of Energy\\nsystem by surface and by annual budget. ORNL is located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, near Knoxville. ORNL's scientific programs focus on materials,\\nneutron science, energy, high-performance computing,\\nsystems biology and national security.\\n\\n- Spallation is a process in which fragments of material (spall) are ejected from a body due to impact or stress. In the context of impact mechanics it describes ejection or vaporization of material from a target during impact by a projectile. In planetary physics, spallation describes meteoritic impacts on a planetary surface and the effects of a stellar wind on a planetary atmosphere. In the context of mining or geology, spallation can refer to pieces of rock breaking off a rock face due to the internal stresses in the rock; it commonly occurs on mine shaft walls. In the context of anthropology, spallation is a process used to make stone tools such as arrowheads by knapping. In nuclear physics, spallation is the process in which a heavy nucleus emits a large number of nucleons as a result of being hit by a high-energy particle, thus greatly reducing its atomic weight.\\n\\n- Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.\\n\\n- A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.\\n\\n- In the physical sciences, subatomic particles are particles much smaller than atoms. There are two types of subatomic particles: elementary particles, which according to current theories are not made of other particles; and \\"composite\\" particles. Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact.\\n\\n- A stellar wind is a flow of gas ejected from the upper atmosphere of a star. It is distinguished from the bipolar outflows characteristic of young stars by being less collimated, although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric.\\n\\n- Radioactive waste is waste that contains radioactive material. Radioactive waste is usually a by-product of nuclear power generation and other applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. Radioactive waste is hazardous to most forms of life and the environment, and is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.\\n\\n- Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies atomic nuclei and their constituents and interactions. The most commonly known application of nuclear physics is nuclear power generation, but the research has led to applications in many fields, including nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear weapons, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.\\n\\n- Geology (from the Ancient Greek , \\"g\\", i.e. \\"earth\\" and -o, \\"-logia\\", i.e. \\"study of, discourse\\") is an earth science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change. Geology can also refer generally to the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars).\\n\\n- In chemistry and physics, nucleons are the proton and the neutron, which are the constituents of the atomic nucleus, and are themselves composed of down and up quarks. The number of nucleons defines an isotope's mass number (nucleon number). The atom is made up of a nucleus surrounded by electrons.\\n\\n- Spall is flakes of a material that are broken off a larger solid body and can be produced by a variety of mechanisms, including as a result of projectile impact, corrosion, weathering, cavitation, or excessive rolling pressure (as in a ball bearing). Spalling and spallation both describe the process of surface failure in which spall is shed.\\n\\n- Energy conservation refers to the reducing of energy consumption through using less of an energy service. Energy conservation differs from efficient energy use, which refers to using less energy for a constant service.\\nDriving less is an example of energy conservation. Driving the same amount with a higher mileage vehicle is an example of energy efficiency. Energy conservation and efficiency are both energy reduction techniques. Energy conservation is a part of the concept of sufficiency.\\n\\n- The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative. DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories.\\n\\n- National security is a concept that a government, along with its parliaments, should protect the state and its citizens against all kind of \\"national\\" crises through a variety of power projections, such as political power, diplomacy, economic power, military might, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'spallation neutron source' and 'tennessee'?","target":"located in the administrative territorial entity","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"located in the administrative territorial entity\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the H√¥tel-Dieu in Beaune.  It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440.  Furthermore,  when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from √©corcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s.  The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les s≈ìurs hospitali√®res de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages.\\nIn the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily.  Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,...","target":"Philip","rationale":"Philip the Good was Duke of Burgundy from 1419 until his death in 1467.

After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, developing his political philosophy, and organizing with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of national independence.\\n\\nBeginning in April 1949, there was considerable pressure on Nkrumah from his supporters to leave the UGCC and form his own party. On 12 June 1949, he announced the formation of the Convention People's Party (CPP), with the word \\"convention\\" chosen, according to Nkrumah, \\"to carry the masses with us.\\" There were attempts to heal the breach with the UGCC; at one July meeting, it was agreed to reinstate Nkrumah as secretary and disband the CPP. But Nkrumah's supporters would not have it, and persuaded him to refuse the offer and remain at their head.  The CPP adopted the red cockerel as its symbol - a familiar icon for local ethnic groups, and a symbol of leadership, alertness, and masculinity. Party symbols and colours (red, white, and green) appeared on clothing, flags, vehicles, and houses. CPP operatives drove red-white-and-green vans across the country, playing music and rallying public support for the party and especially for Nkrumah.

The British convened a selected commission of middle-class Africans, including all of the Big Six except Nkrumah, to draft a new constitution that would give Ghana more self-government. Nkrumah saw, even before the commission reported, that its recommendations would fall short of full dominion status, and began to organise a Positive Action campaign. Nkrumah demanded a constituent assembly to write a constitution. When the governor, Charles Arden-Clarke, would not commit to this, Nkrumah called for Positive Action, with the unions beginning a general strike to begin on 8 January 1950. The strike quickly led to violence, and Nkrumah and other CPP leaders were arrested on 22 January, and the Evening News was banned. Nkrumah was sentenced to a total of three years in prison, and he was incarcerated with common criminals in Accra's Fort James.  Nkrumah's assistant, Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, ran the CPP in his absence; the imprisoned leader was able to influence events through smuggled notes written on toilet paper. The British prepared for an election for the Gold Coast under their new constitution, and Nkrumah insisted that the CPP contest all seats. The situation had become calmer once Nkrumah was arrested, and the CPP and the British worked together to prepare electoral rolls. Nkrumah stood, from prison, for a directly-elected Accra seat. Gbedemah worked to set up a nationwide campaign organisation, using vans with loudspeakers to blare the party's message. The UGCC failed to set up a nationwide structure, and proved unable to take advantage of the fact that many of its opponents were in prison.  In the February 1951 legislative election, the first general election to be held under universal franchise in colonial Africa, the CPP was elected in a landslide. The CPP secured 34 of the 38 seats contested on a party basis, with Nkrumah elected for his Accra constituency. The UGCC won three seats, and one was taken by an independent. Arden-Clarke saw that the only alternative to Nkrumah's freedom was the end of the constitutional experiment. Nkrumah was released from prison on 12 February, receiving a rapturous reception from his followers. The following day, Arden-Clarke sent for him and asked him to form a government.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA and gene encoding porcine DC-SIGN (pDC-SIGN). The full-length pDC-SIGN cDNA encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 240 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that pDC-SIGN, together with bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGN, are more closely related to mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 than to human DC-SIGN. pDC-SIGN has the same gene structure as bovine, canis DC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR8 with eight exons. pDC-SIGN mRNA expression was detected in pig spleen, thymus, lymph node, lung, bone marrow and muscles. pDC-SIGN protein was found to express on the surface of monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, lymph node sinusoidal macrophage-like, dendritic-like and endothelial cells but not of monocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes or lymph node lymphocytes. A BHK cell line stably expressing pDC-SIGN binds to human ICAM-3 and ICAM-2 immunoadhesins in a calcium-dependent manner, and enhances the transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to target cells in trans.

Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows ‚Äì \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy ‚Äì but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions.

In an hours-long process, 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return Zelaya to office. A majority of 65 votes in the 128-member body was required to reject his reinstatement. Zelaya was removed from office in a military-led coup on June 28 and replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. On Wednesday, lawmakers voted one by one and addressed the chamber as they cast their vote, making for a slow process. The vote was a key part of a U.S.-brokered pact that representatives for Zelaya and Micheletti signed October 29, giving Congress the power to decide Zelaya's fate. The United States expressed disappointment Thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in Honduras. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela continued to call on the Honduran government to allow Zelaya's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month. \\"We are disappointed by this decision since the United States had hoped the [Honduran] Congress would have approved his return,\\" Valenzuela said in a conference call with journalists in Washington. \\"Our policy since June 28 has been consistently principled.

A genius.\\" On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \\"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\\" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.

Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released in July 1971 in the United States by Capricorn Records. As the title indicates, the recording took place at the New York City music venue Fillmore East, which was run by concert promoter Bill Graham. It was recorded over the course of three nights in March 1971 and features the band performing extended jam versions of songs such as \\"Whipping Post\\", \\"\\nContext: At Fillmore East was recorded over two nights -- March 12 and 13, 1971 -- for which the band was paid $1250 each show. The shows were typical performances for the band, and regarded as slightly above average by drummer Jai Johanny Johanson. Ads for the shows read: \\"Bill Graham Presents in New York -- Johnny Winter And, Elvin Bishop Group, Extra Added Attraction: Allman Brothers.\\" While Winter was billed as headliner, by the third night the Allman Brothers were closing the show.  Tom Dowd produced At Fillmore East; he had previously worked on their second studio album, Idlewild South. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film Soul to Soul, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. \\"It was a good truck, with a 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff who took care of business,\\" recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, \\"which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics.\\" Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph \\"Juicy\\" Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding \\"unofficial\\" band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. \\"I was just hoping we could isolate them, so we could wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable,\\" said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break to tell him to cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am.  Each night following the shows, the musicians and Dowd would \\"grab some beers and sandwiches\\" and head to Manhattan's Atlantic Studios to go over the performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. \\"We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't want to go back and overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album,\\" said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. \\"That was our pinnacle,\\" said Dickey Betts later. \\"The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have. If you asked everybody in the band, they would probably say that.\\"  On June 27, the Fillmore East closed, and the band were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald. The Beach Boys initially refused to perform unless they headlined the event, but Graham refused, telling them that the Allman Brothers would be closing the show, and they were free to leave if they disagreed. The Allman Brothers' performance was used for additional tracks when an expanded version of At Fillmore East, The Fillmore Concerts, was reissued on CD.\\nQuestion: what happened then?.

Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

Even the fruits and vegetables you eat have different colors: blue blueberries, red strawberries, green broccoli, and orange carrots.\\nPlant and animals often use color to attract attention. The substances responsible for these colors belong to a class of chemical called antioxidants . Plants make antioxidant to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet(UV) light.\\nUltraviolet light causes chemicals called free radicals to form within plant cells. They can destroy parts of plant. Free radicals also have damaging effects on human beings. Some of these effects like wrinkled skin can be seen. The damage is caused by the free radicals attacking cells in our bodies. Certain cancers and heart disease are linked to free radicals.\\nOur bodies have natural defences for fighting off free radicals. While we are young, our defences are pretty strong.

He wrote a number of works, mostly historical, which he scribed and illuminated himself, typically in drawings partly coloured with watercolour washes, sometimes called \\"tinted drawings\\". Some were written in Latin, some in Anglo-Norman or French verse.\\n\\nFrom 1235, the point at which Wendover dropped his pen, Paris continued the history on the plan which his predecessors had followed. He derived much of his information from the letters of important people, which he sometimes inserts, but much more from conversation with the eyewitnesses of events. Among his informants were Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King Henry III, with whom he appears to have been on intimate terms.  The king knew that Paris was writing a history, and wanted it to be as exact as possible. In 1257, in the course of a week's visit to St Albans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, \\"and guided my pen,\\" says Paris, \\"with much goodwill and diligence.\\" It is curious that the Chronica majora gives so unfavourable an account of the king's policy. Henry Richards Luard supposes that Paris never intended his work to be read in its present form. Many passages of the autograph have written next to them, the note offendiculum, which shows that the writer understood the danger which he ran. On the other hand, unexpurgated copies were made in Paris's lifetime. Although the offending passages are duly omitted or softened in his abridgment of his longer work, the Historia Anglorum (written about 1253), Paris's real feelings must have been an open secret. There is no ground for the old theory that he was an official historiographer.  Naturalists have praised his descriptions of the English wildlife of his time, brief though they are: in particular his valuable description of the first irruption into England in 1254 of the common crossbill.\\n\\nHow did Paris become a historian","target":"From 1235, the point at which Wendover dropped his pen, Paris continued the history on the plan which his predecessors had followed.","rationale":"The answer to the question can be found in the first sentence of paragraph 2.\\n\\"From 1235, the point at which Wendover dropped his pen, Paris continued the history on the plan which his predecessors had followed.\\""},{"source":"Answer the question from the given passage.

Thirty-four women received oral doses of 400 mg (in four days), 26 received 600 mg (in four days), and 40 received 800 mg (in two days). Uterine bleeding occurred in all patients within four days of the first dose and continued for 5 to 17 days. In 85 of the women, a dramatic decrease in the plasma chorionic gonadotropin level was observed on day 6, and an empty uterus was confirmed by ultrasonography on day 13. Hence, these women were considered to have had a complete abortion. Fifteen subjects had persistently elevated plasma chorionic gonadotropin levels on day 6 and were considered not to have responded to RU 486. They all had uterine evacuation, which was facilitated by a softening of the cervix. The percentage of women with complete abortion was similar in all dosage groups. Furthermore, plasma levels of immunoreactive RU 486 were similar in subjects with and without complete abortion. The only important side effect observed in the responders was prolonged uterine bleeding in 18 percent, but neither blood transfusion nor curettage was required.

A gene responsible for this disorder has been shown to be linked to the Harvey ras-1 locus (H-ras-1) DNA marker on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p) in 7 families. The purpose of this study was to determine, by analyzing 23 families with LQTS for linkage to chromosome 11p, whether evidence exists for more than one gene causing LQTS (ie, locus heterogeneity). Twenty-three families (262 family members) were clinically evaluated using medical histories, ECGs, and Holter recordings. Each corrected QT interval (QTc) were determined using Bazett's formula. Blood for DNA extraction and cell line immortalization was obtained after informed consent. Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction were performed, and linkage analysis carried out using the LINKAGE computer program (v 5.03). Genetic heterogeneity was determined using the HOMOG 2 (v 2.51) computer program. Twenty-three families were studied for evidence of linkage to chromosome 11p using the H-ras-1 locus probe pTBB-2 and multiple flanking markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Two-point linkage analysis using pTBB-2 and TH markers was consistent with linkage in 15 of 23 families, with the maximum single-family LOD score of +3.038 occurring at theta = 0. However, 8 of 23 families had negative LOD scores, with the values in 4 families being less than -2 at theta = 0, consistent with exclusion of linkage. Analysis with the HOMOG program was consistent with genetic heterogeneity (P < .0001). Multipoint linkage data using pTBB-2 and TH were also examined for evidence of heterogeneity. HOMOG analysis of multipoint LOD scores from 100 cM surrounding the H-ras-1 locus also supported heterogeneity (P < .001). In the 23 families with LQTS analyzed for linkage to the H-ras-1 locus on chromosome 11p15.5, 15 of 23 families had LOD scores consistent with linkage. The remaining 8 of 23 families had negative LOD scores, 4 of which were definitively excluded from linkage. Thus, genetic heterogeneity is definitively (P < .001) demonstrated for this disorder. \\n Question: What is the mode of inheritance of Romano Ward long QT syndrome?","target":"autosomal dominant","rationale":"The correct answer is 'autosomal dominant' which is a mode of inheritance.

Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop.

With a career that spanned nearly 80 years, Hope appeared in more than 70 short and feature films, with 54 feature films with Hope as star, including a series of seven \\"Road\\" musical comedy movies with Bing Crosby as Hope's top-billed partner. In addition to hosting the Academy Awards show nineteen times, more than any other host, he appeared in many stage productions and television roles, and was the author of 14 books.\\nContext: In 1998, five years before his death, a prepared obituary written by the Associated Press inadvertently was released, resulting in Hope's death being announced on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. However, Hope remained in relatively good health until late in his old age, though he became somewhat frail in his last few years. In June 2000, he spent nearly a week in a California hospital being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding. In August 2001, he spent close to two weeks in a hospital recovering from pneumonia.  On the morning of July 27, 2003, Hope died of pneumonia aged 100 at his home in Toluca Lake, California. His grandson Zach Hope told TV interviewer Soledad O'Brien that, when asked on his deathbed where he wanted to be buried, Hope told his wife, Dolores, \\"Surprise me.\\" He was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Garden at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Los Angeles, joined in 2011 by Dolores when she died--four months after her 102nd birthday. After his death, newspaper cartoonists worldwide paid tribute to his work for the USO, and some featured drawings of Bing Crosby, who had died in 1977, welcoming Hope to Heaven.  As a final honor and tribute to his life of service to the USO and to men and women of the United States Military, on July 30, 2003, the United States Congress passed the Bob Hope Arlington Honors Act of 2003, which \\"Directs the Secretary of the Army to permit the burial of Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope of California, an honorary veteran of the armed forces, in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, upon the request of his family.\\"\\nQuestion: What did he fall ill with?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"pneumonia","rationale":"The context mentions that Hope died in 2003 due to pneumonia."},{"source":"I gave my students this multiple choice question: One astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun.

While some 20 hectares of the surrounding area is used for pasture, the stream is bordered by deciduous plants such as Alder and Birch and Bulrush can be found in non-shadowed patches. Some 2,5 kilometres from its origin, the stream passes down in a culvert under a traffic route (Akallav√§gen) and the Barkarby Airport before merging with the stream Djupanb√§cken. This part of the catchment area contains a motocross track, a golf driving range, a closed dump, and receives stormwater from the E18 traffic route. Thereafter, the stream flows some 4¬†km in the valley separating the suburbs Akalla-Hjulsta and Tensta-Rinkeby and where are several rural structures including an ecological farm (H√§sta G√•rd), eight allotment-gardens, and some minor overgrown wetlands. East of the valley the river is crossed by a second traffic route (Kymlingel√§nken) before flowing 2,5¬†km through an open grassland to reach a railway and the E4 traffic route, water from the latter treated in a local cleaning plant. The last 1.4¬†km passes more allotment-gardens and the gardens of the Ulriksdal Palace before jumping into Edsviken through a low dam.\\n Passage 3:After stopping at Madeira and the Cape Colony, the Investigator reached Australia in December 1801. It sailed along the south coast, through Bass Strait, and north along the east coast to overwinter at Port Jackson. It then sailed north up the east coast, rounding the Cape York Peninsula and entering the Gulf of Carpentaria. The ship by then being in extremely poor condition, the survey was broken off and the Investigator was sailed to Koepang, Timor. Many members of the crew became sick with dysentery there, and Flinders took the decision to return to Port Jackson as quickly as possible. They sailed southwards well west of the west coast of Australia, then east along the south coast, arriving back at Port Jackson in June 1802. The Investigator was condemned, and Flinders sailed for England as passenger on the Porpoise, there to ask for a new ship. Though initially inclined to remain at Port Jackson with some of the other naturalists, ultimately Allen chose to board the Porpoise. On 17 August the Porpoise was wrecked on Wreck Reef. Everyone on board was marooned on a sandbank for six weeks while Flinders sailed the ship's cutter back to Port Jackson to seek help. When help arrived it was in the form of two ships, one of which would return to Port Jackson, while the other was en route to China. Allen elected to sail to China. From there he took a passage to England on the Henry Addington. Arriving at Brighton on 8 August 1804, Allen made his way to London, where he gave to Banks the first eye-witness account of the voyage, including breaking the news of the death at Port Jackson of the gardener Peter Good.","target":"3","rationale":"The question asks for ships that have wrecked on Wreck Reef.

This was the third match-up between brothers Peyton Manning (Broncos) and Eli Manning (Giants), with Peyton Manning winning the previous two match-ups as a member of the Indianapolis Colts &#8212; 2006 and 2010. The Giants grabbed the lead midway through the first quarter, with a 36-yard field goal by placekicker Josh Brown. In the second quarter, a 20-yard touchdown run by running back Knowshon Moreno gave the Broncos the lead. Two field goals by Brown &#8212; from 24 and 41 yards &#8212; gave the Giants a 9-7 lead. The Broncos re-claimed the lead just before halftime, with placekicker Matt Prater nailing a 42-yard field goal. The Broncos increased their lead in the third quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. The Giants responded, with running back Brandon Jacobs rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to pull the Giants to within 17-16 with three minutes remaining in the third quarter. However, the Broncos would seize control of the game with 21 unanswered points, beginning with a 25-yard touchdown run by Moreno, followed in the fourth quarter by an 11-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to tight end Julius Thomas, and return specialist Trindon Holliday returning a punt 81 yards for a touchdown. The Giants tried to rally, with quarterback Eli Manning throwing a 23-yard touchdown pass to running back Da'Rel Scott with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but a 47-yard field goal by Prater put the game out of reach. Peyton Manning improved his head-to-head record against Eli Manning to 3-0.

Equation 1\\\\nSince we are given that time taken to cross a pole is 6 seconds and speed is 25 m/s, hence time to cover length equal to one meter will be 1 second i.e Time taken to cross a pole which is x meter long will be equal to x second . Therefore we have following equation :-\\\\ntime taken for crossing pole (x sec.)=time taken for covering distance equivalent to one meter in seconds(1 sec.) multiplied by number of poles covered(x)\\\\ntime taken for crossing pole (x sec.)=1*6=6sec..Equation 2\\\\ny+x=150.....

Time taken by train and length travelled are directly proportional so if they increase proportionately then their reciprocal i;e average velocity would remain same .So lets equate both equations :- \\\\nAverage velocity at start point: y/(travelling time from starting point till reaching pole)=y/(y+x)=y/150............equation 4 \\nAverage velocity at end point: y/(travelling time from starting point till reaching next station after passing over first station )=(2y)/(2*6)=2*25 .........equation 5\\nEquating equation 4 and 5:\\\\ny/150=50     => y=7500   =>   Length of Train -> 7500m"},{"source":"Question with options: can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? \\n\\nContext:\\n\\nFelipe Gonz√°lez M√°rquez (born March 5, 1942) is a Spanish socialist politician.

At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios,  in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him \\"just a little wear on [his] tape heads\\". While completing the early recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments, except drums, himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989). The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.Reznor coined the name \\"Nine Inch Nails\\" because it \\"abbreviated easily\\", rather than for \\"any literal meaning\\".

One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because she was 34 years of age and thus too old to enlist.\\n\\nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966. She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.  After Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes, he championed H.J.Res. 341, a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion to commodore by special Presidential appointment. She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy's few female admirals.  Following a career that spanned more than 42 years, Admiral Hopper took mandatory retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986. At a celebration held in Boston on the USS Constitution to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.  At the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days).

In 1938, while the sisters were part of the cast of Twentieth Century Fox's production of Alexander's Ragtime Band, Stafford met the future members of The Pied Pipers and became the group's lead singer.

Passage:The longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards, a record set by Matt Prater on December 8, 2013. The previous record was 63, originally set by Tom Dempsey (1970) and then matched by Jason Elam (1998), Sebastian Janikowski (2011), David Akers (2012), Graham Gano (2018), and Brett Maher (2019). The record in the CFL is 62 yards, set by Paul McCallum on October 27, 2001. High school, college and most professional football leagues offer only a three-point field goal; however, some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through four-point field goals. NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three (much like Australian rules' Super Goal or basketball's three-point line), a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League. Similarly, the sport of arena football sought (unsuccessfully) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points; it failed, since only one kicker (Brian Mitchell) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency. (In six-man football, where there is no offensive line, all field goals are worth four points instead of the usual three.)","target":"The longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards, a record set by Matt Prater on December 8, 2013","rationale":"The question asks for the name of the opposing team when Prater kicked the longest field goal in NFL history.

Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005. It was duly sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for ¬£420,000 (¬£478,400 including auction fees and taxes). The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the ¬£254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997. The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation. Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display. It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester.

The vapor pressure of a liquid is a measure of this ability. Specifically, vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor that is in equilibrium with its solid or liquid phase. For substances with a stronger drive to enter the gas phase, more vapor particles will be present in the same amount of space, resulting in a higher pressure.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War¬†II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.\\n\\n- A tank is an armored fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat, with heavy firepower, strong armour, and tracks providing good battlefield manoeuvrability. The first tanks were designed to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare; now they are a mainstay of modern ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.\\n\\n- The Panzer II is the common name used for a family of German tanks used in World War II. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen II ( abbreviated PzKpfw II ) . Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while larger , more advanced tanks were developed , it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II , during the Polish and French campaigns . The Panzer II was the most numerous tank in the German Panzer divisions beginning with the invasion of France . It was used in both North Africa against the British and on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union . The Panzer II was supplanted by the Panzer III and IV by 1940/1941 . Thereafter , it was used to great effect as a reconnaissance tank . By the end of 1942 , it had been largely removed from front line service and it was used for training and on secondary fronts . The turrets of the then obsolete PzKpfw Is and PzKpfw IIs were reused as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers , particularly on the Atlantic Wall . Production of the tank itself ceased by 1943 , but its chassis remained in use as the basis of several other armored vehicles , chiefly self - propelled artillery and tank destroyers such as the Wespe and Marder II.\\n\\n- Firepower is the military capability to direct force at an enemy. (It is not to be confused with the concept of \\"rate of fire\\", which describes cycling of the firing mechanism in a weapon system.) Firepower involves the whole range of potential weapons. The concept is generally taught as one of the three key principles of modern warfare wherein the enemy forces are destroyed or have their will to fight negated by sufficient and preferably overwhelming use of force as a result of combat operations.\\n\\n- During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.\\n\\n- The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"h√≥los\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaust√≥s\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5¬†million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.\\n\\n- A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.\\n\\n- A battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces, or combatants. A war sometimes consists of many battles. Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment.\\n\\n- A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.\\n\\n- Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"\\n\\n- The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.\\n\\n- The Panzer¬†I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s. The name is short for the German (\\"armored fighting vehicle mark I\\"), abbreviated \\"\\". The tank's official German ordnance inventory designation was SdKfz¬†101 (\\"special purpose vehicle 101\\").\\n\\n- Combined arms is an approach to warfare which seeks to integrate different combat arms of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects (for example, using infantry and armor in an urban environment, where one supports the other, or both support each other). According to strategist William S. Lind, combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of \\"supporting arms\\" as follows:\\nCombined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other(s).\\n\\n- Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery.

Their music is known for its brand of \\"minimalistic psychedelia\\". Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways.\\nContext: Most members of Spacemen 3 have continued to produce music and record either collaboratively or in solo projects. Peter Kember (alias 'Sonic Boom') has had a solo career releasing music under the monikers Spectrum and E.A.R., and has also done production work for MGMT, Panda Bear, Dean & Britta and The Flowers of Hell. Jason Pierce (alias 'J. Spaceman') remains the leader and creative force, and only constant member, of the alternative band Spiritualized who have achieved significant critical acclaim and commercial success. Both Kember and Pierce continue to perform some Spacemen 3 songs live (e.g. \\"Transparent Radiation\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Suicide\\", \\"Set Me Free\\", \\"Che\\" and \\"Let Me Down Gently\\" [Kember]; and \\"Take Me to the Other Side\\", \\"Walkin' with Jesus\\", \\"Amen\\" and \\"Lord Can You Hear Me?\\" [Pierce]).  Will Carruthers, Jonny Mattock and Mark Refoy formed Spiritualized with Pierce in early 1990. Carruthers left the band after the first album in 1992; followed by Mattock and Refoy in 1994. Refoy then fronted Slipstream who released two albums. Refoy played guitar for the Pet Shop Boys on their live tour in 2007. Will Carruthers took a hiatus from the music industry after leaving Spiritualized; but subsequently has worked with Kember, recorded two solo albums as Freelovebabies, and has most recently toured with The Brian Jonestown Massacre. Carruthers, Mattock and Refoy have also collaborated on projects together.  After leaving Spacemen 3 in 1988, both Pete Bain and Stewart Roswell ('Rosco') joined the neo-psychedelic band Darkside who released several albums. Following the end of Darkside, Bain formed 'Alphastone', and has assisted Kember on some of the latter's solo projects. As of 2010 he provides vocals and guitar in 'The Urgz'. Stewart Roswell (alias Sterling Roswell) released a solo album, The Psychedelic Ubik, in 2004.  In the early 1990s, early Spacemen 3 drummer Natty Brooker played bass under the alias 'Mr Ugly' in Garage rock band 'The Guaranteed Ugly', with Gavin Wissen. They released two albums. Brooker provided cover artwork for Spacemen 3's Recurring album and early Spiritualized releases.

His grandparents were originally from County Mayo, Ireland. He attended Charlotte Catholic High School and then Georgetown University, where he majored in international economics, commerce and finance. At Georgetown, he was an Honors Scholar, the highest level of academic achievement awarded to members of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, and ultimately graduated with honors in 1989.\\n\\nWhile promoting the Trump administration's budget proposal in March 2017, Mulvaney stated that, as to taxpayers, the government was \\"not gonna ask you for your hard-earned money, anymore... unless we can guarantee to you that that money is actually being used in a proper function.\\" For instance, Mulvaney justified cuts to block grants that go towards spending on Meals on Wheels because it was \\"just not showing any results.\\" Others disagreed with Mulvaney's statement, citing research that has \\"found home-delivered meal programs to significantly improve diet quality, increase nutrient intakes, and reduce food insecurity and nutritional risk among participants. Other beneficial outcomes include increased socialization opportunities, improvement in dietary adherence, and higher quality of life.\\"  On May 22, 2017, Mulvaney presented President Trump's $4.1 trillion 2018 United States federal budget. The budget included cuts to the United States Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the social safety net and increases in funding for defense spending and paid family leave. The \\"America First\\" budget included a 10.6% decrease in domestic program spending and a 10% increase in military spending, in addition to $1.6 billion for a border wall. The budget would remove $272 billion from welfare programs, including $272 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. The budget would also remove $800 billion from Medicaid, and $72 billion from Social Security disability benefits, while removing nothing from Social Security retirement or Medicare benefits. Mulvaney projected the budget will not add to the federal deficit because future tax cuts will lead to 3% GDP growth. He described the budget as \\"the first time in a long time that an administration has written a budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the taxes.\\"  In December 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation forecasted that with dynamic scoring the $1.5 trillion reduction in revenues will increase the federal deficit by $1 trillion. Regulatory implementation of the tax cuts have been delayed by a dispute between Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin regarding the involvement of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  In February 2018, Mulvaney released the President's $4.4 trillion 2019 United States federal budget, which would add $984 billion to the federal deficit that year, and $7 trillion over the next 10 years. Later that month, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which allowed yearly federal deficits to reach $1 trillion. In March 2018, Congress ultimately passed the $1.3 trillion Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which funded the government's operations until the end of the fiscal year in September.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Mick Mulvaney","rationale":"The entity mentioned in the text is Mick Mulvaney, a politician and businessman who currently serves as White House Chief of Staff.\\nHe was born on July 21st, 1967 to Michael \\"Mike\\" and Kathleen \\"Kathy\\" Mulvaney.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.","target":"Yes","rationale":"The text states that the cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in church texts and publications.

Youll buy fewer items in the long run, so youll save money as well as resources. Thats a win-win! Repair rather than replace. Fix your bike rather than buying a new one. Sew on a button instead of buying a new shirt. Youll use fewer resources and save money. Buy only what you need. Dont buy a gallon of milk if you can only drink half of it before it spoils. Instead, buy a half gallon and drink all of it. You wont be wasting resources (or money!) Buy local. For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20.

Every person perceives himself to have a sort of invisible shield surrounding his physical body. When someone comes too close, he feels uncomfortable. When he bumps onto someone, he feels obligated to apologize. But the size of a person's \\"comfort zone\\" depends on his cultural ethnic origin. For example, in casual conversation, many Americans stand about four feet apart. In other words, they like to keep each other \\"at arm's length\\", people in Latin or Arab cultures, in contrast, stand very close to each other, and touch each other often. If someone from one of those cultures stands too close to an American while in conversation, the American may feel uncomfortable and back away.\\nWhen Americans are talking, they expect others to respond to what they are saying. To Americans, polite conversationalists empathize by displaying expressions of excitement or disgust, shock or sadness. People with a \\"poker face\\", whose emotions are hidden by a deadpan expression, are looked upon with suspicion. Americans also indicate their attentiveness in a conversation by raising their eyebrows, nodding, smiling politely and maintaining good eye contact. Whereas some cultures view direct eye contact as impolite or threatening, Americans see it as a sign of genuineness and honesty. If a person doesn't look you in the eye, American might say, you should question his motives--or assume that he doesn't like you. Yet with all the concern for eye contact, Americans still consider staring--especially at strangers--to be rude.\\nQuestion: What the author discussed in the previous section is most probably about   _  .\\nAnswer:","target":"some other cultural aspects of nonverbal communication","rationale":"In the first paragraph, it is discussed that every person has an invisible shield surrounding his physical body.

Other species cannot do this. Elimination of their habitat‚Äîwhether it is a forest, coral reef, grassland, or flowing river‚Äîwill kill the individuals in the species. Remove the entire habitat within the range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the species will become extinct. Human destruction of habitats (habitats generally refer to the part of the ecosystem required by a particular species) accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. Consider the exceptional biodiversity of Sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and the Sumatran tiger, but half of Sumatra‚Äôs forest is now gone. The neighboring island of Borneo, home to the other species of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. Forest loss continues in protected areas of Borneo. The orangutan in Borneo is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it is simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of Borneo. The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations (Figure 21.8). Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics, and biodiesel in Europe. A 5-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years from 2000 to 2005 was 3.1 percent. Much loss (2.4 percent) occurred in the humid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction.

The film is about a boy with Asperger syndrome ( played by Greg Timmermans ) who retreats into the fantasy world of the MMORPG ArchLord to escape bullying . The film 's title is a reference to the leet version of the Dutch phrase \`\` ( ik ) ben niks '' , meaning \`\` ( I ) am nothing '' . The novel was inspired by the true story of a boy with autism who committed suicide because of bullying . The film won three awards at the 31st Montreal World Film Festival : the Grand Prix des Am√©riques , the Prix du Public for the most popular film , and the Ecumenical Jury Prize for its exploration of ethical and social values .

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

The word derives from the Greek , meaning \\"concurrence\\". In some instances a syndrome is so closely correlated with a pathogenesis or etiology that the words \\"syndrome\\", \\"disease\\", and \\"disorder\\" end up being used interchangeably for them. This is especially true of inherited syndromes. For example, Down syndrome, WolfHirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the \\"syndrome\\" nomenclature. In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms.\\n\\n- An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).\\n\\n- Webzen is a South Korean developer and publisher of video games.

M√∂tley Cr√ºe with Girls, Girls, Girls (1987) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987) hit their commercial peak, the latter producing seven hit singles (a record for a hard rock act).

However, he was also hampered by great injury troubles, as he tore his cruciate ligaments three times in this time, the first coming after a German Cup match against SC Freiburg on 15 July 2001. The player had an MRI scan which showed he had torn knee ligaments and underwent surgery on his right knee on 22 July at the Vail, Colorado clinic of world-renowned knee specialist surgeon Dr. Richard Steadman. He healed completely after that, and came back to play the 2002 UEFA Cup Final for Dortmund against Feyenoord Rotterdam on 8 May 2002, which Dortmund lost 3‚Äì2 at the Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam.

William Goodday of Maldon. Entering the army in 1778, he joined his regiment, the 61st, at Minorca. Later he was appointed to a company in the 91st, and took part in the defence of St. Lucia. In 1782, having exchanged into the 97th, he served at the siege of Gibraltar. On the signing of the preliminaries of peace he purchased a majority in the 60th regiment, and, being placed on half-pay, visited several German courts. In 1787 he was sent with his regiment to the West Indies, where he took an active part in military affairs. Succeeding to a lieutenant-colonelcy by special command of George III, he was removed to the 54th, and went with the army of Lord Moira to Flanders. In 1794 he bore a very distinguished part against the French at Tiel, going through much hard fighting. On his return he was sent to St. Vincent, where he was raised to the rank of brigadier-general. In January 1796, with two hundred men, he attacked a force of twelve hundred, being himself thrice wounded, and losing his right leg. On his return to England he was received with marked favour by the king, and on 23 February 1796 was made deputy governor of Stirling Castle, afterwards serving upon the staff in Ireland. On 23 June 1798 he was raised to the rank of major-general, and on 13 May 1800 he was, as a reward for his services, appointed to the sinecure office of governor of Quebec, and he held that post until his death.

Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, the ruling Tokugawa shogunate of Japan pursued a policy of isolating the country from outside influences. Foreign trade was maintained only with the Dutch and the Chinese and was conducted exclusively at Nagasaki. However, by the early nineteenth century, this policy of isolation was increasingly under challenge. Following the Perry Expedition and with the increased threat to Japanese sovereignty posed by the European powers and their Black ships, the Japanese government turned towards the Dutch for technical and military assistance. The Nagasaki Naval Training Center was opened in 1855 with Dutch military advisors to teach the Japanese about steam warship technology. On arrival, he found that his predecessor Jan Karel van den Broek had been devoting much of his energies into production of a Japanese-Dutch/Dutch-Japanese dictionary, and acting as technical advisor on a wide range of engineering and technical questions, rather than concentrating on medicine or medical education. However, this provided Pompe van Meerdervoort with a foundation on which he was able to establish a school of western medicine on 12 November 1857. Initially, he had only twelve students and used the residence of Takashima Sh≈´han to lecture on biology, chemistry, human anatomy, physiology, and pathology. He performed the first recorded human autopsy in Japan, and his student base quickly expanded to over 133 students, including Kusumoto Ine, the daughter of Philipp Franz von Siebold.

Passage:Peter Jackson and partner/co-writer Fran Walsh conceived the idea for The Frighteners in 1992, during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Together, they wrote a three-page film treatment and sent it to their talent agent in Hollywood. Robert Zemeckis viewed their treatment with the intention of directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt (which he helped produce). Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993. The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for The Frighteners in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided The Frighteners would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Pictures. Universal green-lighted the film to commence pre-production on a $26 million budget in April 1994.

It completely blindsided me. I made F talk to me on the phone the next day and found out she had been harbouring resentment on me for the last 1.5 yrs. She said that what caused it all was when I didn‚Äôt visit her at the hospital when she gave birth to her daughter. \\n\\nTwo months prior to her giving birth (April), I had a miscarriage (Feb). It put me in a severe depression and maybe this was my fault but I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with it except socially isolate myself from friends, especially those pregnant or with kids, until I felt more emotionally stable. One week before my friend‚Äôs due date, I threw her an impromptu baby shower and spent a lot of money on it, buying her dinner at a fancy restaurant and buying baby stuff. By the end of the shower, I went back into a depressed state - the talk about babies and motherhood really reminded me of what I couldn‚Äôt have and it just messed me up. I didn‚Äôt make a scene at the shower but didn‚Äôt say anything to my friend. I decided that I would just hide for a while. My husband decided we should get away and we decided to go to Hawaii because we had the next week off. Without thinking about my friend or anyone else but my husband and I, we went and it helped us. While I was in Hawaii, my friend texted me the news about her birth and I congratulated her. We talked on the phone one time after she was out of the hospital, but I didn‚Äôt visit her for the next three months. It partly because I was anxious about it, but I also got pregnant shortly afterwards the trip. Having gone through the miscarriage, I ended up focusing my energy on trying to concentrate on my new pregnancy and seeing if I could make it through the first trimester. \\n\\nWith that said, I didn‚Äôt think about seeing my friend or her baby for 3 months until I felt more secure about myself. I figured she was busy anyways. After our first meeting in a a while, we started spending time together  and when my daughter was born, we started seeing each other more, maybe 1x a month, which I thought was fine. \\n\\nWith that said, we carried on as if everything was normal and I didn‚Äôt know she resented me that entire time. She says that a real friend wouldn‚Äôt have gone to Hawaii and that I should‚Äôve been at the hospital (she had some complications and believes she could‚Äôve died from the birth). She also feels we are not close because I should‚Äôve let her help me solve my depression with the miscarriage. I mean, I did tell her about it when it happened and I don‚Äôt recall her knocking at my door or calling me, but for me, that was fine. I had no expectations.

Techniques that use (approximate) second-order information are rarely used because of the computational cost and noise associated with those approaches in deep learning contexts.   However, in this paper, we show how feedforward deep networks exhibit a low-rank derivative structure.   This low-rank structure makes it possible to use second-order information without needing approximations and without incurring a significantly greater computational cost than gradient descent.   To demonstrate this capability, we implement Cubic Regularization (CR) on a feedforward deep network with stochastic gradient descent and two of its variants.   There, we use CR to calculate learning rates on a per-iteration basis while training on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.   CR proved particularly successful in escaping plateau regions of the objective function.   We also found that this approach requires less problem-specific information (e.g. an optimal initial learning rate) than other first-order methods in order to perform well.","target":"We show that deep learning network derivatives have a low-rank structure, and this structure allows us to use second-order derivative information to calculate learning rates adaptively and in a computationally feasible manner","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe show that deep learning network derivatives have a low-rank structure, and this structure allows us to use second-order derivative information to calculate learning rates adaptively and in a computationally feasible manner.\`\\n\\n\\"#;"},{"source":"Read the following context and choose the best option to answer the question.\\nContext: This last week has brought a lot of reflection .

The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate.\\nShostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"...","target":"Shostakovich","rationale":"The rationale to choose \\"Shostakovich\\" as the answer is that:\\n[Options]\\n- at one point it says \\"...in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists.

Karad≈æiƒá standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, and Gaj and Daniƒçiƒá standardized the Croatian Latin alphabet, on the basis of vernacular speech phonemes and the principle of phonological spelling. In 1850 Serbian and Croatian writers and linguists signed the Vienna Literary Agreement, declaring their intention to create a unified standard.

Yet, in practice, the variants of the conceived common literary language served as different literary variants, chiefly differing in lexical inventory and stylistic devices.

As the game was being developed for a Nintendo console, the team included multiple Nintendo-themed Easter eggs for players to find. The team had to create a new game engine as previous ones were not able to cope with the scale of the environments. They also wanted the main character, Chase McCain, to have depth as they knew both children and adults would play the game. Undercover features full voice acting, which at the time development started was a first for the series, although due to development time, others featuring voice acting were developed and released ahead of it. For the voice casting, the team used voice casting and recording company Side UK. A large voice casting session was held, and several established comedians were specifically asked to come in as the team wanted good delivery for the funny sections of the script. By the time the script writer, former stand-up comedian Graham Goring, was brought on board, a rough outline of the story had been created. His main role was to fill in the gaps and put in as much humor as possible. Goring was given a lot of freedom when it came to the parodies, although the team were regularly consulted on the suitability of the material and a script editor was assigned to check his work. Drawing on his former profession, Goring included a large amount of one-liners and humor intended for both children and adults.

At the start of the tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences.\\nThe first stage of the tour's itinerary took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels and then on to Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first symphonies. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766.\\nThe material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service. However, the journey enabled the children to experience to the full the cosmopolitan musical world, and gave them an outstanding education.

Nonetheless, massive supervision remains a luxury for many real applications, boosting great interest in label-scarce techniques such as few-shot learning (FSL). An intuitively feasible approach to FSL is to conduct data augmentation via synthesizing additional training samples. The key to this approach is how to guarantee both discriminability and diversity of the synthesized samples. In this paper, we propose a novel FSL model, called $\\\\textrm{D}^2$GAN, which synthesizes Diverse and Discriminative features based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). $\\\\textrm{D}^2$GAN secures discriminability of the synthesized features by constraining them to have high correlation with real features of the same classes while low correlation with those of different classes.   Based on the observation that noise vectors that are closer in the latent code space are more likely to be collapsed into the same mode when mapped to feature space, $\\\\textrm{D}^2$GAN incorporates a novel anti-collapse regularization term, which encourages feature diversity by penalizing the ratio of the logarithmic similarity of two synthesized features and the logarithmic similarity of the latent codes generating them. Experiments on three common benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of $\\\\textrm{D}^2$GAN by comparing with the state-of-the-art.","target":"A new GAN based few-shot learning algorithm by synthesizing  diverse and discriminative Features","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nA new GAN based few-shot learning algorithm by synthesizing  diverse and discriminative Features"},{"source":"who owns the trump tower in new york??","target":"Donald Trump","rationale":"According to the New York Times, Donald Trump owns and operates the Trump Tower in New York."},{"source":"Classify the given comment into 'Hope Speech' or 'Not Hope Speech'.

Descended from an old aristocratic family from Brittany, Chateaubriand was a royalist by political disposition; in an age when a number of intellectuals turned against the Church, he authored the Genie du christianisme in defense of the Catholic faith. His works include the autobiography Memoires d'Outre-Tombe (\\"Memoirs from Beyond the Grave\\", published posthumously in 1849-1850). In his early works, he used the name Auguste instead of Rene.\\n\\nAfter the fall of the French Empire, Chateaubriand rallied to the Bourbons. On 30 March 1814, he wrote a pamphlet against Napoleon, titled De Buonaparte et des Bourbons, of which thousands of copies were published. He then followed Louis XVIII into exile to Ghent during the Hundred Days (March-July 1815), and was nominated ambassador to Sweden.  After Napoleon's defeat, Chateaubriand became peer of France and state minister (1815). In December 1815 he voted for Marshal Ney's execution. However, his criticism of King Louis XVIII in La Monarchie selon la Charte, after the Chambre introuvable was dissolved, got him disgraced. He lost his function of state minister, and joined the opposition, siding with the Ultra-royalist group supporting the future Charles X, and becoming one of the main writers of its mouthpiece, Le Conservateur.  Chateaubriand sided again with the Court after the murder of the Duc de Berry (1820), writing for the occasion the Memoires sur la vie et la mort du duc. He then served as ambassador to Prussia (1821) and the United Kingdom (1822), and even rose to the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs (28 December 1822 - 4 August 1824). A plenipotentiary to the Congress of Verona (1822), he decided in favor of the Quintuple Alliance's intervention in Spain during the Trienio Liberal, despite opposition from the Duke of Wellington. Although the move was considered a success, Chateaubriand was soon relieved of his office by Prime Minister Jean-Baptiste de Villele, the leader of the ultra-royalist group, on 5 June 1824.  Consequently, he moved towards the liberal opposition, both as a Peer and as a contributor to Journal des Debats (his articles there gave the signal of the paper's similar switch, which, however, was more moderate than Le National, directed by Adolphe Thiers and Armand Carrel). Opposing Villele, he became highly popular as a defender of press freedom and the cause of Greek independence. After Villele's downfall, Charles X appointed him ambassador to the Holy See in 1828, but he resigned upon the accession of the Prince de Polignac as premier (November 1829).  In 1830 he donated a monument to the French painter Nicolas Poussin in the church of \\"San Lorenzo in Lucina\\" in Rome.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand","rationale":"The entity is Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand, a French writer and politician."},{"source":"Given a pair of words, generate the relation between them.
