My Birthday will be in May.\\n\\nAnyways, onto the context. I'll start with saying that I absolutely can not stand kids. I don't like being around them, talking about them or interacting with them BUT I always hide it in front of kids because I have these feelings no matter how they behave, so I can't be rude or anything to kids simply because they exist.\\nSo, about a little over a year ago one of my aunts had twins. I am happy for her and I do love my cousins and I even play with them sometimes and am always nice to them, because even if I don't like Kids they are still Family and obviously if normal well behaved baby behaviour is annoying me it's not their fault.\\n\\nOn the other Hand I am quite vocal about my dislike for Kids and I make it very clear that even though I will interact with my cousins when I meet them I do not want to see any baby pictures or talk about baby stuff, and the most I want to hear about them is an occasional reassurance that they are okey since it is enough for me to see them at most family events. \\n\\nI always liked to go to family events, and I do like doing stuff with my aunts, and my grandparents and my mom (my parents do not live together) but since the children are there this has become a sensitive topic because of my absolute disinterest in anything related to babies. I don't even think my cousins are cute and especially my childless aunt (Sabine) takes offense to that. She has this giant mother complex and even though we get along very well normally there is tension between us whenever this topic comes up since I get annoyed at her for trying to force me into caring more than I can, and she gets annoyed at me for not caring enough.\\n\\nThe other aunt (Mel), the one who actually has the kids, understands my point of view and is actually the most civil person is this whole thing. She knows how I feel and that I try my best around her kids and I think she appreciates that I try to overcome my uncomfortable-ness around her kids.\\n\\nSo now that you know the context and the kind of drama this has already caused in my family I can finally explain the real conflict. I apologize for the length of this but I want you to be able to make a fair judgement so you had to know the Situation and the feelings of the persons involved.\\n\\nI know it will be another 5 months until my birthday comes around but Christmas has got me thinking. Since my aunt Mel had her children EVERY single family get together was centered completely around them. Times where adjusted so just she could bring them (what is fine, since I would not want her to miss out on Christmas and easter and stuff), we took extra long to let the children unpack all christmas presents her family got and no one really cared when anyone else got presents since the children where playibg with theirs and this was 'soooo cute', everyone only talks about the children and to the children etc.\\n\\nIt's not that I don't want my cousins to be at my birthday party. It's just that I saw today at my brothers birthday party that the twins seem to take absolute priority over the one whos celebrating and since my next 2 birthdays will be very special to me (the last one where I live at home and my last one before I will move very far away to my dream city) I want them to be about me getting together with my family. (I always have separate celebrations for friends and family). \\n\\nI do not want everyone sitting there gushing over the children and not talking to me, because that is exactly what happened last time and at every other family event over the last 1 and a half years since Mel announced her pregancy.\\nBut because of the situation I explained above I am not in a position to just adress this as it will just be met with \\"Well you should just try to include yourself into that topic! (Children)\\" - I tried that already. \\nSo in order to get what I want (a Birthday get together with my family where I am actually really included), I'd have to ask them not to bring the twins.\\n (Important note: I do not want to be the total center of attention! In fact I want no total center of attention at all since I just want everyone to be equally included and that can't happen if the kids are there!)\\n\\nI would also understand if they had to go earlier because of this and offer to help them get a babysitter. \\nSo would I be the asshole for asking my aunt not to bring her kids to my next 2 birthday parties?","target":"HYPOTHETICAL","rationale":"The author describes a potential future situation in which they are considering asking their aunt to not bring her children to their birthday parties.

Nicholas planned a railway from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917.

Her abuser is in prison, but he has an opportunity to get out on day leave in April. She has to go to the prison and give her statement on why she doesn't believe he should get day leave (he's been imprisoned less than a year) and this is very stressful and triggering for her. Her PTSD keeps her from working, and she's currently on disability. \\n\\n- My girlfriend has been \\"self-medicating\\" with cannabis for over two years now. She's high maybe 50-70% of the day, and it's affecting our relationship and her healing progress (it causes her anxiety to be without it now). She's admitted to herself that she's addicted to it and began the journey of quitting weed last week.  \\n\\n- We live in Canada and cannabis is legal and sold in stores. \\n\\n- She doesn't have her licence at the moment and doesn't have money to spend until her next cheque. The only way she can get weed is if I take her to the store. \\n\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLast night my gf was having a really rough time because she was going over the news articles about her abuser. She was feeling very triggered and began having a panic attack, begging me to take her to the cannabis store, saying she'd pay me back on the 1st. \\n\\nAt first she said she wanted just a CBD strain, then that evolved into wanting a balanced THC/CBD strain. \\n\\nShe said she's been having a really rough time this past week while trying to quit, and she should be able to smoke once a week when she's very anxious. She was getting hysterical and was hyperventilating and it was horrible to see her feel that way. \\n\\nI ended up saying no and just taking her for a drive instead. My reason being is that it's hard for me to differentiate between her actually needing cannabis for her PTSD, or her using it to feed her addiction and hide from her emotions. The first day she started quitting she begged me in a similar way and had a panic attack, but afterwards she told me she was happy I said no and she truly realized how much it has control over her. \\n\\nI think the reason she had such a strong panic attack in the first place yesterday is because that was the first time in forever that she dealt with those emotions sober. \\n\\nPart of the reason why she's behind in her healing progress is because she doesn't know how to deal with ANY bad emotion while sober anymore. Weed was always her go-to. \\n\\nShe ended up calming down after a while but I feel incredibly guilty. I don't know if what I did was the best thing to help her or not. \\n\\nEven today she's still trying to convince me to take her to the store, and I feel stuck. I don't want to enable her addiction but at the same time I don't want her to have panic attacks because I didn't get her what she needed. \\n\\nAITA in this situation?\\n\\nTLDR: My girlfriend has been using cannabis to help with PTSD for two years but now she's become addicted and can't go without it.

Since 2002 the line up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals) and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and State of Emergency (4 February 2006).\\n\\nIn February 2002, The Living End's line up changed as Demsey left and was replaced on drums in April by Andy Strachan (ex-Pollyanna). Dempsey wanted to spend more time with his family, and had a dislike of heavy touring; in August that year he joined Fez Perez, and later joined a punk, folk rock group, The Currency. The Living End developed a side project, The Longnecks, to test out Strachan and new material for their third album, Modern ARTillery, without attracting wide public attention. The name is a reference to longneck beer bottles. The Longnecks name was re-used by the band to try out potential material for later albums. They have also played under other names: Glen Waverley & The Mentones, The Dovetones, Roller Toasters, Doncaster & The Dandenongs and Redwings; at various venues in regional Victoria.  In mid-2002 The Living End recorded four tracks, including \\"One Said to the Other\\", which were released as an EP in January the following year and reached the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Two of its tracks were re-recorded in Los Angeles with Mark Trombino (Blink-182, Jebediah) producing, together with new material for Modern ARTillery, which appeared on 28 October 2003. It peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart, top 50 in New Zealand, and top 40 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums Chart. \\"Who's Gonna Save Us?\\" was issued a month earlier, as the lead single, which reached top 40 in Australia, top 30 in New Zealand and on Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart. They followed with heavy touring (including Big Day Out) promoting their releases.  On 27 September 2004 the band released a compilation album, From Here on In: The Singles 1997-2004, early versions included a bonus disc, Under the Covers, which had six cover versions of other artist's tracks. The CD featured two new tracks: \\"I Can't Give You What I Haven't Got\\" and \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\". They also issued a compilation DVD, From Here on In: The DVD 1997-2004, which collated their music video clips and live performances of the groups at festivals: Splendour in the Grass and Big Day Out in Sydney, and from Summer Sonic in Japan.

Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry, while almost simultaneously another great inventor was developing its primary competitor, which would become much more widespread.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: A scientist has just returned to the lab after working out in the field.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water.

By eliminating most or all synthetic pesticides and fertilizer in favor of growing crops naturally with on-farm resources such as manure & animal bedding material can reduce pollution risk associated with large scale commercial agriculture.

One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products.","target":"beaker A","rationale":"Since twice as much of the reactant is added to beaker B, this means that there will be more collisions in beaker B than in beaker A.

Kind of important note about her: she's fairly shy around new people and tends to be quiet when she feels she has nothing good to add.\\nI'm in a groupchat with 4 close friends (was 5 at the time, 1 has cut us off, but that's unimportant).

We were talking about some artists that I know my gf likes (we were technically only \\"talking\\" at this point but we were basically dating). I made a comment about how *gf name* would enjoy this conversation, but I didn't think it would be a good idea to add her to the chat. My friends said it would be fine, so I did.

After that night she rarely says anything at all in the chat, and if she does it's almost always a single response that doesn't add anything to the conversation. It's been this way the entire time she's been in the chat, but she reads everything that's said in the chat. About a month or two ago, I made an offhand comment to her that if she doesn't want to be in the groupchat then she doesn't have to. She told me that she's fine with being in it and likes to read the messages. We haven't spoken about it since. It kind of makes me uncomfortable having her in the chat.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die.

He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896.\\n\\nEllis, son of Edward Peppen Ellis and Susannah Mary Wheatley, was born in Croydon, Surrey (now part of Greater London). He had four sisters, none of whom married. His father was a sea captain, his mother the daughter of a sea captain, and many other relatives lived on or near the sea. When he was seven his father took him on one of his voyages, during which they called at Sydney, Callao and Antwerp. After his return, Ellis attended the French and German College near Wimbledon, and afterward attended a school in Mitcham.  In April 1875, Ellis sailed on his father's ship for Australia; soon after his arrival in Sydney, he obtained a position as a master at a private school. After the discovery of his lack of training, he was fired and became a tutor for a family living a few miles from Carcoar. He spent a year there and then obtained a position as a master at a grammar school in Grafton. The headmaster had died and Ellis carried on the school for that year, but was unsuccessful.  At the end of the year, he returned to Sydney and, after three months' training, was given charge of two government part-time elementary schools, one at Sparkes Creek, near Scone, New South Wales and the other at Junction Creek. He lived at the school house on Sparkes Creek for a year.

Passage:The first obelisks may start to appear in the later 16th century and it is suggested that the obelisk on Compton Pike is Elizabethan in date. More securely dated is a series of obelisks which start to appear in the 18th century. The first of these was the Wakeman obelisk of 1702 by Nicholas Hawksmoor, which is set in the square at Richmond, Yorkshire. Probably several hundred obelisks exist in the British Isles dating from 18th and early 19th centuries. Most of these obelisks, which are often landmarks commemorate famous people and their achievements. At Stowe in Buckinghamshire an obelisk was erected in memory of Wolfe's victory at Quebec in 1752, while at the death of the Duke of Cumberland in 1765 was noted by an obelisk at Englefield Green in Surrey. Thomas Coke, Earl of Leicester, Coke of Norfolk the farming pioneer has a particularly fine obelisk, set up in the park he created at Holkham in Norfolk. Sometimes an obelisk was used to mark the site of a battle such as the obelisk on the site of English Civil War battlefield at Naseby in Leicestershire. Occasionally obelisks are used as mile markers, as on the Great North Road at a mile from Westminster.

Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.\\n\\n- In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played.\\n\\n- Gateways to Annihilation is the sixth studio album by the death metal band Morbid Angel . This album saw a change in musical style as the speed - laden intensity of the previous album Formulas Fatal to the Flesh was abandoned for a slower , more droning style , reminiscent of Blessed Are the Sick . This is also the first album in which Steve Tucker contributed lyrics and music to the band . Dan Seagrave painted the album cover . This marks the first Morbid Angel album cover he had painted since Altars of Madness .\\n\\n- Morbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida. The band was one of the original death metal bands signed to Earache Records, and was also influential in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots to its current form by incorporating guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, atonality in guitar soloing, and dark, chunky, mid-paced rhythms. They have been described as one of \\"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\\", alongside Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \\"God of Emptiness\\" shown on an episode of \\"Beavis and Butt-head\\". Their first four albums are considered classics in the genre.\\n\\n- Earache Records is an independent record label based in Nottingham, England and New York, United States. It helped to pioneer extreme metal by releasing many of the earliest grindcore and death metal records between 1988 and 1994.\\n\\n- Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.\\n\\n- A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\".\\n\\n- Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.\\n\\n- Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.\\n\\n- Dissection (from Latin ' \\"to cut to pieces\\"; also called anatomization), is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. Autopsy is used in pathology and forensic medicine to determine the cause of death in humans. It is carried out by or demonstrated to biology and anatomy students in high school and medical school. Less advanced courses typically focus on smaller subjects, such as small formaldehyde-preserved animals, while the more advanced courses normally use cadavers. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a morgue or in an anatomy lab.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'record label' with 'earache records'.","target":"gateways to annihilation","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"gateways to annihilation\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. For the team's first defensive play, they would come out with only 10 players on the field, as their honor to Taylor. In the first quarter, the Redskins took the early lead as kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Redskins increased their lead as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got on the board as linebacker Angelo Crowell sacked quarterback Jason Campbell in his end zone for a safety. The Redskins would end the half as Suisham kicked a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills drew closer as kicker Rian Lindell managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Later, the Redskins responded with running back Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Bills ended the half as Lindell kicked a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Bills drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, along with a 33-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got into position to kick a 51-yard field goal. They got the kick, but Head Coach Joe Gibbs called timeout.

The combination treatment is reportedly going to cost $17,600 per month, and it is not clear whether payers will cover it. This story does not quantify the benefits at all except for saying that the safety and efficacy was tested on over 400 patients. What benefits they received from the treatment are totally omitted from the story. This is unacceptable, especially as the FDA provided some quantification in their news release. This story states both the severe and mild side effects of taking this drug. We’ll rule this Satisfactory since there was a good-faith attempt to address the criterion. However, while the array of side effects are listed they are not quantified. We do not know what proportion of those taking the medication get each side effect. Nor do we know how severe they are, or how many stopped the medicine die to the side effects. More detail would have been welcome. This story provides no evidence at all and relies on the fact that the FDA approved the drug combination. The research that led to the approval is not described in any meaningful way. There is no disease mongering here. Advanced melanoma is a terrible disease and many treatments fail. There appear to be no outside sources used in this story. All the information comes from the FDA. However, because of that, there is no conflict of interest as the drug manufacturer/distributor is identified, but no information apparently comes from them. It is important to remember here that the role of the FDA is to approve based on effectiveness and safety and the bar for both in a disease like melanoma is low. How clinically useful this drug will prove to be is open to question and it would have been nice to hear from some independent oncologists about that. No alternative therapies are discussed in the story. There is a lot of new drug development for melanoma; none mentioned. Because this is an announcement from the FDA about approval, the drug will now be marketed for treatment, and the story clearly indicates that the drug combination is distributed by Genentech. We’ll rule this Satisfactory, but we’d caution that FDA approval does not necessarily equal availability. The key factor here is the cost and who will pay for it, or not. The story doesn’t address this. The news hook here is the FDA approval of this drug combination. We’ve already given the story credit for this above under “Availability.” And we’d note that just because the FDA approves something, doesn’t mean that it’s novel. There are plenty of “me-too” drugs out there, and this story doesn’t make any attempt to clarify how this new drug combination works differently or better than existing drugs. This story appears to rely exclusively on a news release from the FDA and there are many similarities in the text of the two documents.

The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a $42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to $180 from $140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay $90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly $2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled $4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed $538,000 of that amount.

In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other than their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.","target":"Patagonian mara","rationale":"From the article, we can see that Patagonian mara rodents are raised communally but kept from nursing from anyone other than their own moms.\\nSo an answer for the question is: \\"Patagonian mara\\"."},{"source":"You are given a news article headline from BBC Yoruba and your task is to classify it into one of the following categories:  Africa, Entertainment, Health, Nigeria, Politics, Sport, or World.\\n\\nClimate Change: Àwọn ọmọ Nàìjíríà mẹ́ta gba owó ìrànwọ́ iwádìí ìjìnlẹ̀","target":"Nigeria","rationale":"This headline is about Nigerian youth raising funds to tackle climate change.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century.

In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called \\"kef\\" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \\"kef\\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of \\"kef music\\" heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time.

Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry.

In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure below ). Dams are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break. In that case, flooding can be catastrophic. Flood waters can also overflow a dam. People may line a river bank with levees to protect against floods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods. Flood protection in one location sometimes causes problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream. This will lead to flooding in a different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be allowed to flood.\\n\\nand the situation: Two villages experienced flooding this spring.

Battle of Fort Sumter -- The Battle of Fort Sumter (April 12--13, 1861) was the bombardment of Fort Sumter near Charleston, South Carolina by the Confederate States Army, and the return gunfire and subsequent surrender by the United States Army, that started the American Civil War. Following the declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20, 1860, its authorities demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor. On December 26, Major Robert Anderson of the U.S. Army surreptitiously moved his small command from the vulnerable Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress built on an island controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor. An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area except for Fort Sumter.","target":"Yes","rationale":"The battle of Fort Sumter occurred when the Confederate states army demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor, and Major Robert Anderson moved his small command from Fort Moultrie to fort sumter, which was a substantial fortress built on an island controlling the entrance of Charleston harbor. This indicates that South Carolina authorities seized all Federal property in charleston area except for fort sumter because they did not want it to be under Union control since south carolina had already seceded after declaring secession on December 20 1860 at the start of civil war.

Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters.\\n\\nand a hint : On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface.   The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).  Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which continent experienced more hurricanes?","target":"Lemuria","rationale":"The clue states that Lemuria experienced natural disasters, while Oceania had milder weather and did not experience these events. Natural disasters include tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms (which are caused by strong temperature contrasts). Since the question specifically mentions hurricanes as a type of severe storm system to compare between the two continents regarding their frequency, it can be inferred that Lemuria experiences more hurricanes than Oceania does.

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby.\\nInitially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake.\\nWhen Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker. Upon entering the Walker ranch, Flicka damages a fence and releases some of HD's prize cows. At Amy's request, HD asks for Flicka as payment for the damage, threatening to turn it into a lawsuit if Hank refuses. Amy then starts training with Flicka for a championship, but performs poorly during the actual competition because of Flicka's fear of the crowd and camera flashes from the audience.

Some ecosystems rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source. This sulfur then supports marine ecosystems in the form of sulfates. Human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. The burning of large quantities of fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere. As rain falls through this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain, which damages the natural environment by lowering the pH of lakes, thus killing many of the resident plants and animals. Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems. Acid rain also affects the man-made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings. For example, many marble monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, have suffered significant damage from acid rain over the years. These examples show the wide-ranging effects of human activities on our environment and the challenges that remain for our future.\\n\\n\\nQ: Acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through which gas?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- sulfide dioxide\\n\\n- carbon dioxide\\n\\n- essential dioxide\\n\\n- sulfur dioxide\\n\\nA:","target":"sulfur dioxide","rationale":"The last sentence of the question suggests that acid rain is caused by sulfur dioxide gas."},{"source":"Based on the premise \\"so what's what's eating out cheap for you is McDonald's or something like that\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"What is eating out expensive for you?\\" is true (see options)?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The premise provides the example of McDonald's, which is an inexpensive fast food restaurant.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other.

More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.\\n\\nAnswer this question please: Which forest will have more honey fungus?","target":"Peak Forest","rationale":"The context mentions that the mycologist found two villages with forests nearby. The Peak Forest has more signs of water saturation than Valley Forest, and this causes a greater rate of decay in wood. More fungi are present in Peak Forest as compared to Valley Forest.

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\".\\n\\nFTP. On mobile, and not a native English speaker.\\n\\n\\nSome backstory : \\n\\n\\nI’ve known D for about 3 years in a uni association. We at first didn’t engage much, but then had to work together, and automatically became friends. \\nSince then, we’ve been seeing and texting each other regularly, and it felt good to have found someone who is like the friendship equivalent of a soulmate. To say, after watching the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, we said that if we ever end up alone in our 40s, we will date each other. \\n\\nThings between us have always been easy. We were at first a trio, but the other girl, L (30F), has been a true pain. She knew D for a couple of years longer, and has seen me like the intruder in a way. She acted like she was my friend, but then would tell D how I was toxic for her, when really she was the one who was toxic, and trying to be D’s only friend and making her her property in a way. \\n\\nThis didn’t put a strain in my relationship with D, and more so, reinforced it. We had each other’s back. \\n\\nTwo years ago, I went through a really tough break up, and at the time D had gotten into a relationship with a very manipulative guy. He would dictate her every move, and was all around a bad guy. I warned her, and told her to break it off. She didn’t really listen, as I was very much in the slump and couldn’t possibly rationalise it all with her. \\n\\nShe ended up breaking up in February 2017, which was a relief for me, but then she spent the entire year crying about how much of a monster he was, although I had warned her multiple times that he was sucking the life out of her. \\n\\nThings didn’t get better, when she found out she had a strain of HPV that gave her condylomas, and the timing matched with when she was with that guy. I did my best to be there for her, and reassure her that it wasn’t the end of the world. Offered to be with her when she went to the gynaecologist, and also when she went to get them lasered off. I listened to her on the phone hours at the time, when she cried because of him, thought she would never be able to be with someone ever again, and beating herself about it all. She had zero self esteem at that point. \\n\\nI did what any best friend would do, and explained to her that all of this wasn’t true, that she wasn’t worthless, and will find someone who will be beyond her expectations. \\n\\n\\nAll through it all, she barely inquired how I was doing. I was going through a shit year, and except some times when I would break down in front of her, she was basically inexistant. Never asked how I was holding up, never offered to cheer me up. I get it. She was going through her own stuff, and I couldn’t hold her accountable for it. \\n\\nSo I sucked it up. \\n\\n\\nAt the end of 2017, she started seeing this guy, who was initially trying to get together with me, but I rejected him over and over, because I was still hoping my ex would come back, and truly, he wasn’t my type personality wise. I need someone who is very active, quick witted, who can make me laugh, and who isn’t in some sort of half asleep state all the time. \\n\\nBut anyway, the guy didn’t want a relationship, and was just profiting off her state to get sex, basically living at her place and not spending a dime when helping with groceries or anything. She even did his laundry. FFS. What king of man child is that. \\n\\nHere again, I told her he wasn’t a good fit for her, that he used her as a surrogate mother who would also have sex with him. She didn’t listen. She needed the attention and told me it felt great that he would be here at night to stroke her hair. Fine. \\n\\n\\nThen he started dropping the ball continuously. \\nThey established they would have a sort of open relationship. Except he knew first hand that she wasn’t going to act on anything because she was unable to trust men anymore. He is very socially awkward and although not ugly at all he still scared people off because he’s just weird at first. He used her weakness to profit from the situation. They said that the rule was no telling. She didn’t want to hear about who he thought was attractive, or who he fucks. \\n\\nBut he mentioned one girl, even had her name in one of his passwords, called her by her name, you know the drill. \\n\\nShe kept coming to me crying saying that he fucked up again. At the time, I met my now boyfriend and was doing so much better, so I was ready to be her clutch again although she wasn’t mine for so long. So I listened, warned her, again and again, even had my boyfriend explain that as a guy he thinks his behaviour is unacceptable and so on and so forth. \\n\\nShe didn’t want to quit it. I told her that she didn’t need to come telling me about those things because it would just make me mad. She still did. And I still listened. \\n\\nA couple of weeks ago, she went on a trip, and she met this guy. They didn’t have sex, like no PiV but did everything around. I asked her why she didn’t go all the way when she recounted her nights with him, absolutely over the moon. And she said that she wasn’t allowed to “take off her clothes” when with someone else. Like. What ? She could do bj’s, get fingered, whatever else, but no PiV. I was mad. I didn’t know about this. How can you call this an open relationship ? Yeah you don’t. He’s profiting. Because she would excuse him for fucking someone all the way, but he would probably have thought it’s a deal breaker. Screw that. \\n\\nSince October, I’ve been very depressed. I can barely get out of bed. I can barely have sex with my boyfriend. I almost don’t eat anymore. Life is all together shitty. But yet again now, although I’ve told her, she doesn’t give a shit, or at least doesn’t try to be a friend to me. \\nSo when she told me that her guy got upset because she “slept” with someone, I had enough. She was in tears saying that she fucked things up, and I told her I didn’t want to hear it. \\n\\nI went to leave, and she called me selfish. She doesn’t seem to realise that I have been suicidal, but I should somehow give a shit about her shitty relationship when I’m this down. \\n\\nI snapped at her and said that I don’t give a crap if she feels bad, because once again I warned her multiple times that this guy is a piece of work, and that she shouldn’t have agreed to anything with him if she wasn’t able to put up with it. \\n\\nNow I think our relationship is broken and there might be no going back unless she accepts that I’m also hurting in my own way, and have other things on my mind. She won’t apologise because she thinks I’ve overreacted, but I don’t see it. \\n\\nSo AITA for telling her to fuck off ?","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The author seems to have acted ethically in this situation. The friend has gone through some difficult times, but the author has always been there to offer support and encouragement. After being a supportive friend for so long, the author is now going through their own difficult time and needs some support from the friend. The friend is not offering any support or sympathy, however, and she criticizes them for not giving more attention to her own problems. This makes the author feel guilty about expressing their own struggles and sharing how they are feeling at this time.\\\\nThis is unfair because it places a burden on the author that they do not need to shoulder at this moment - providing emotional support only goes one way in this friendship instead of being mutual between both friends as it should be - and it does not take into account that everyone can experience tough times when they need extra care or consideration from others who care about them. It also puts pressure on someone who may already be struggling with depression and other health issues by making them feel like they are responsible for helping another person when they may have limited energy or resources available due to their current state of well-being or other circumstances in life that are demanding attention right now (such as work/school).\\\\nTherefore, given these factors which suggest an imbalance between friends where emotional labor is expected only from one direction rather than shared equally, we conclude that the answer \\\\\\"RIGHT\\\\\\" (the author has acted ethically) is correct here.\\""},{"source":"Two analogies that signify affordances are given in the form \\"A : B.

That means that while Italians may enjoy a glass of wine or beer, they don't usually get very drunk.\\nThat's not true anymore. The new study by the Italian National Health Institute found that 63 percent of Italians under age 18 get drunk on the weekends. Now, the city of Milan has created a law that will stop anyone under 16 from buying alcohol. Anyone who sells or gives alcohol to a person under 16 can be fined up to $700.\\nYoung people who feel that the new law is unfair should go to the US for some perspective. The US has the highest drinking age in the world: It's illegal for anyone under 21 to buy alcohol, and stores or restaurants that are caught selling alcohol to people under the legal age risk losing their licenses.\\nMany young Americans complain that the drinking laws are unfair: They are allowed to vote in elections and join the military at age 18, so why wait another three years just to buy a bottle of beer?\\nThese young people have found help in an unusual place. Last year, more than 100 presidents of US universities joined together to ask lawmakers to consider changing the drinking age. They argued that the law doesn't stop underage college kids from getting drunk - it just makes them want to drink more.\\nFor now, the law seems unlikely to change. But US teenagers who want alcohol can go north to Canada, where the drinking age is 18-19, or south to Mexico where the legal age is 18. Throughout much of Asia, Africa and Europe, the legal drinking age ranges 16-18.\\nIn plenty of places though, the official drinking age is ignored, and even young children can buy alcohol if they have the money to pay for it.\\nNo matter how old you are, you should always be responsible with alcohol.

Thus if we use this equation and apply it to both Ellen and Sarah, where m = 1kg for each because they are throwing a softball (1 kg) , then we can see that their accelerations must be different in order for them to have two different forces acting on the ball . This would mean one person has more energy than another when she throws. So at rest, with no kinetic energy stored up, Ellen would only need to accelerate her arm slightly faster as compared to sarah so that she could hit the ball harder due solely to having greater initial force applied to it from"},{"source":"Grace and I are good friends.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.

His inventions have helped more than 100 million people around the world. \\"I chose to focus on problems where my knowledge of science  could help,\\" Gadgil said.\\nIn the 1990s, Gadgil designed his first life-saving invention after more than 10,000 people died from Bengal cholera   because of the clean water crisis   in India. His invention uses ultraviolet light to kill deadly disease-carrying germs   from drinking water. It costs just one cent to clean five liters of water (about 21 cups). So far, the invention has provided safe drinking water for more than five million people in India and other developing countries.\\nGadgil's another important invention is the Berkeley-Darfur Stove  . The long and violent war in Darfur, Sudan, has caused many people to move to foreign countries and live in refugee camps  . They are given food aid. But people still have to travel a long distance five times a week to gather firewood to cook meals. This can be dangerous because of street violence in the area. To avoid danger, some spend much of their money used to feed their families buying firewood.\\nThe stove Gadgil created cuts fuel usage by 55%. That means people wouldn't have to leave the camps to find firewood as often. The invention also helps to save homes more than $300 a year.

His answer was simple: look for the best in other people.\\nThroughout his life he's never thought ill of other people. He looks for the best and praises them. Branson at times seems almost not human. He's too good at what he does. No, great. Nearly perfect. When he starts something, he is very likely to succeed. He has fallen out with others though, like anyone else. He is human. He told me:\\"Life is short and the world is much smaller than one realizes. You are going to come across people time and time again in the most surprising places ... As a leader it's even more important to be out there praising and encouraging people. If you do fall out with somebody in life, even if you think it was their mistake, give them a call. Befriend them.

It has been further suggested that the vagal component of this prolongation of TE is due to the temporal summation of pulmonary stretch receptor (PSR) activity during expiratory loading. This hypothesis was tested in rabbits exposed to resistive and elastic single-breath expiratory loading while PSR's were simultaneously recorded. Both types of loads resulted in a decreased expired volume (VE) and increased expiratory duration (TE). The TE for resistive loads were significantly greater than for elastic loads for equivalent VE. Thus two different VE-TE relationships were found for resistive and elastic loads. When TE was plotted against the area under the expired volume trajectory, a single linear relationship was observed. PSR activity recorded during expiratory loading increased as VE decreased and TE increased. A single linear relationship resulted when the number of PSR spikes during the expiration was plotted against the associated TE for all types of loads. These findings demonstrate that the volume-related prolongation of TE with single-breath expiratory loads is associated with an increase in PSR discharge. These results support the hypothesis that the vagal component of load-dependent prolongation of TE is a function of both the temporal and spatial summation of PSR activity during the expiratory phase.","target":"Effect of expiratory loading on expiratory duration and pulmonary stretch receptor discharge","rationale":"The title should highlight the main focus of the paper and provide a clear indication of what was tested, how it was tested, and the key results.

Under 100 words is a good title length.\\n\\nThe immunostimulatory effects of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (CpG-ODN) in certain base contexts have been extensively studied in man and mice. One major action is their ability to trigger production of massive amounts of interferon-a (IFN-a) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), also referred to as natural IFN-a/b producing cells (NIPC). The present study using porcine PBMC activated by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA revealed a considerable variation in the IFN-a production in response to various CpG-ODN constructs. Several phosphodiester ODNs, such as 5 0 TTTTCAATTCGAAGATGAAT 3 0 (ODN H), and the plasmid pcDNA3 all required pre-incubation with lipofectin in order to induce IFN-a. Intact unmethylated CpGs were also important, because methylation or substitution of the cytosines and CpG-inversion strongly reduced the IFN-a induction by single-or double-stranded forms of ODN H. Certain CpG-ODNs that contained flanking phosphorothioate or phosphodiester poly-G sequences were potent inducers of IFN-a without pre-incubation with lipofectin, for instance the ODN 2216 (5 0 GGGGGACGATCGTCGGGGGG 3 0 ). While poly-G sequences have been suggested to increase uptake of ODNs by cells, they did not obviate the need for lipofectin when added to the ODN H. However, they resulted in up to five-fold increases of the IFN-a levels caused by ODN H upon lipofection, indicating other enhancing effects of poly-G sequences on the induction of IFN-a. The identity of the IFN-a producing cells (IPC) stimulated by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA was studied by means of flow cytometry using combined staining for intracellular IFN-a and surface markers. Approximately 1-3 IPC/10 3 PBMC were detected, compared to only 3 IPC/10 4 PBMC stimulated by Aujeszky's disease virus. The IPC frequencies were confirmed by detection of IFN-a mRNA positive cells by in situ hybridisation. The IPC induced by CpG-ODN or plasmid DNA had a similar phenotype, expressing CD2 and CD4 and intermediate levels of MHC class II and the myeloid marker SWC3, but not the markers of T and B cells or","target":"Characteristics of oligodeoxyribonucleotides that induce interferon (IFN)-a in the pig and the phenotype of the IFN-a producing cells monocytes (CD3, CD21 and CD14)","rationale":"The title should provide information about the characteristics of oligodeoxyribonucleotides that induce interferon (IFN)-a in the pig and the phenotype of the IFN-a producing cells.

Rajinikanth's ancestors hailed from Mavadi Kadepathar, Maharashtra and Nachikuppam, Tamil Nadu. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers (Satyanarayana Rao and Nageshwara Rao) and a sister (Aswath Balubhai).\\n\\nIn January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in Rana, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time. During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion. He was treated at St. Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged. Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit. Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating. Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment. It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush.  On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs signal, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011.  Despite several failed attempts to restart Rana upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his Enthiran character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film Ra.One (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. In November 2011, it was decided that Rana would be shelved in favour of a new project with Rajinikanth, titled Kochadaiiyaan. The motion capture film, which is the first of its kind in India, was released in 2014 to positive reviews. Kochadaiiyaan, and the 3D release of Sivaji in 2012, made Rajinikanth the first Indian actor to have appeared in four different forms of world cinema: black-and-white, colour, 3D and motion capture. Following the completion of Kochadaiiyaan, Rajinikanth began work in Ravikumar's next directorial venture, titled Lingaa alongside Anushka Shetty and Sonakshi Sinha. The film was released on 12 December 2014, coinciding with his birthday, and received mixed reviews from critics. Rajinikanth's next film was director Pa. Ranjith's crime drama Kabali, produced by S.

We call these balls Yuanxiao or Tangyuan. Obviously, they get the name from the festival itself. It is said that the custom of eating Yuanxiao originated during the Eastern Jin Dynasty in the fourth century, then became popular during the Tang and Song periods. The fillings inside the dumplings or Yuansiao are either sweet or salty. Sweet fillings are made of sugar, Walnuts, sesame , osmanthus flowers , rose petals, sweetened tangerine peel, bean paste, or jujube paste . A single ingredient or any combination can be used as the filling . The salty variety is filled with minced meat , vegetables or a mixture. The way to make Yuanxiao also varies between northern and southern China. The usual method followed in southern provinces is to shape the dough of rice flour into balls, make a hole, insert the filling, then close the hole and smooth out the dumpling by rolling it between your hands. In North China, sweet or nutmeat stuffing is the usual ingredient. The fillings are pressed into hardened cores, dipped lightly in water and rolled in a flat basket containing dry glutinous rice flour. A layer of the flour sticks to the filling, which is then again dipped in water and rolled a second time in the rice flour. And so it goes, like rolling a snowball, until the dumpling is the desired size. The custom of eating Yuanxiao dumplings remains. This tradition encourages both old and new stores to promote their Yuanxiao products. They all try their best to improve the taste and quality of the dumplings to attract more customers. \\n Question: Which country does the Lantern Festival come from?","target":"china","rationale":"The Lantern Festival is a Chinese festival, therefore the answer should be \`china\`."},{"source":"The task is to generate the correct answer for a given math problem.\\n\\nProblem: a metered rikshaw charges rs 13.50 for the first 1 km and 2.50 per 1 / 3 km there after . what would the charge if this rikshaw is hired for 13 kms ? in approx ? ?","target":"103.5 rs","rationale":"The rikshaw charges 13.50 for the first 1 km and 2.50 per 1/3 km there after, so it would charge 13.50 + 2.50*8 = 103.5 rs for a distance of 13 kms"},{"source":"Constipation is not a glamorous topic, but it’s certainly important, especially in older adults.\\nAs anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being.\\nConstipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as:\\n* Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits\\n* Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful\\n* Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia\\n* Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized)\\n* Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel\\n* Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation\\nFortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation.

The patients were water loaded until a hypotonic diuresis was established. Vasopressin was infused in stepwise increments from 0.4-12 fmol/kg X min. Both patients had increased renal sensitivity to vasopressin, achieving negative free water clearance at infusion rates of 0.4 and 4 fmol/kg X min (normal greater than or equal to 6). Treatment for 3 months with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) led to an improvement in behavior and the reporting, for the first time, of a sensation of thirst.

STUDY This retrospective analysis was conducted using sera from 105 HCC patients, 107 CLD patients, and 71 normal control subjects. The miRNAs were measured using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The conventional HCC markers α-fetoprotein (AFP), lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3%), and des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) were measured with commercial kits.   \\n RESULTS Serum levels of miR-16 and miR-199a were significantly lower in HCC than in CLD patients or control subjects (P<0.01). As a single marker, miR-16 had the highest sensitivity for HCC, followed by miR-199a, AFP, DCP, AFP-L3%, and miR-195. The combination of miR-16, AFP, AFP-L3%, and DCP yielded the optimal combination of sensitivity (92.4%) and specificity (78.5%) for HCC, overall and when analysis was restricted to patients with tumors size smaller than 3 cm. As a second-line HCC marker, miR-16 yielded positive HCC predictions in 18 of the 26 (69.2%) HCC patients with negative results on all 3 conventional markers, most of whom had tumors size smaller than 3 cm; miR-16 was falsely positive in only 12 of 96 (12.5%) CLD patients.   \\n CONCLUSIONS The addition of miR-16 to conventional serum markers improved sensitivity and specificity for HCC.

The interaction between hormonal and developmental signals is a critical mechanism in the generation of this enormous plasticity. A good example is the response to the hormone ethylene that depends on tissue type, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. By characterizing the Arabidopsis wei8 mutant, we have found that a small family of genes mediates tissue-specific responses to ethylene. Biochemical studies revealed that WEI8 encodes a long-anticipated tryptophan aminotransferase, TAA1, in the essential, yet genetically uncharacterized, indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) branch of the auxin biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of TAA1 and its paralogues revealed a link between local auxin production, tissue-specific ethylene effects, and organ development. Thus, the IPA route of auxin production is key to generating robust auxin gradients in response to environmental and developmental cues.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not provide a clear and concise summary of the main idea or findings.

A linear accelerometer was affixed to the lever arm. Speed settings were standardized percentages of each machine's maximum tachometer feedback voltage (0 to 100% Vfb max). Regression of Cybex transducer-observed voltages (V0) on true, i.e., expected, torques (Me) revealed that, for any static loading condition or angle, the measurement system was essentially linear and valid, although greater variance was evident for smaller torques. However, different calibrations, i.e., regression lines, were required for different speed settings. The error in predicting Me from V0 increased substantially with increased % Vfb max. Methodologies which assume constant velocity dynamic loading induce questionable, often invalid, results and inferences. Dynamic V0 represents both gravitational and inertial components. Considerable fluctuations in lever arm instantaneous velocity were ascribed to the combined influence of load and % Vfb max upon the servomotor. After computing inertia-corrected Me, calibration variability and prediction error were markedly reduced. Unexplained variability may be due to poor proximity of the Cybex transducer to the force application point. We concluded that: Cybex II should be calibrated only statically; use of an optimal filter will avoid false estimates of joint torque; inertial corrections must be applied in order to minimize potentially serious errors due to system angular acceleration; and reported muscle function relationships might be usefully re-assessed in view of these findings. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"Numerical data (i.e., values of V0 and Me) was collected from the Cybex II and Lumex dynamometers in order to evaluate their measurement characteristics at different speeds under various conditions of inert gravitational loading.

The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park’s elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630 m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900 m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600 m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north.

For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer?\\nScientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer.\\nIn a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them.\\nCancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet.\\nDrinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics.\\nSome believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising,...\\nQuestion: Why do scientists think ginger can be used to fight against cancer?\\nAnswer:","target":"Ginger can destroy diseased cells in two different ways.","rationale":"There are two ways that ginger can be used to fight cancer, as mentioned in the article. First, it causes cancer cells to self-destruct without harming healthy cells around them. Second, it tricks diseased cells into fighting among themselves and destroys their growth environment.\\nSo option A is correct because \\"Ginger can destroy diseased cells in two different ways."},{"source":"Answer the question depending on the context.\\nContext: Although initially the Germans were welcomed by most Estonians as liberators from the USSR and its oppressions, and hopes were raised for the restoration of the country's independence, it was soon realised that the Nazis were but another occupying power.

Between May 1975 and May 1985, the NWRSP screened 850,431 infants, detecting 192 infants with primary hypothyroidism (1:4429) and eight with hypopituitary hypothyroidism (1:106,304). In 11 additional infants, TSH deficiency, not detected by the screening program, was diagnosed on recognition of clinical features over the same period. Thyroid hormone treatment was begun in seven of the 11 infants prior to obtaining the screening sample results because of clinical symptoms of hypopituitarism, including hypoglycemia, persistent jaundice, microgenitalia, diabetes insipidus, midface hypoplasia, cleft lip or palate, or abnormalities of vision. The other four infants were not detected despite clinical features of hypopituitarism (in retrospect) and low serum T4 with TSH concentration below assay sensitivity on at least one screening sample. The most accurate assessment of total cases comes from Oregon, where all cases of congenital hypopituitarism are referred to our center; we estimate a frequency of 1:29,000. In our experience, a combination of newborn T4-supplemental TSH screening measurements and recognition of clinical features of hypopituitarism is the optimal strategy for detecting infants with congenital hypopituitary hypothyroidism.","target":"Detection of congenital hypopituitary hypothyroidism: ten-year experience in the Northwest Regional Screening Program","rationale":"In this paper, the authors examined the results of a thyroid screening program over its first 10 years to determine whether hypopituitary hypothyroidism would be detected by a primary thyroxine (T4)-supplemental thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening strategy.

When the moving drumstick strikes the drum head, the drum starts to vibrate. The motion of the vibrating drum head creates the sound you hear. Any form of energy can change into any other form. Frequently, one form of energy changes into two or more different forms. Have you ever sat in front of a campfire? What are two things you notice? The fire creates light. It is also warm by the fire, meaning it creates heat. The energy of the fire comes from the stored energy in the wood. The wood contains chemical energy. As it burns, the chemical energy is changed into light and heat. Not all chemical energy changes produce light and heat. Our cars use gasoline as a fuel. Gasoline contains chemical energy. When our cars burn gasoline in their engines, it is converted into motion and heat.

This means that the answer Yes is correct because even though there may have been more than one step involved in transforming this particular type of chemical energy into its final result (sound), all types of potential or stored chemical energies will eventually become some combination of heat, light, electrical current or kinetic force once converted via a generator or other machine."},{"source":"Read the article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: Everybody knows the saying \\"Two steps forward and three steps back\\".

Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.\\nContext: Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball, and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.  It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The king set out by the River Thames on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End. The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and William Walworth, the mayor of London, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \\"I am your captain, follow me!\\", he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.  The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.  It is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals. One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor (King of Bohemia Charles IV) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.  Michael de la Pole had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's favourite. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.  Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions. Instead, a so-called crusade led by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, was dispatched, which failed miserably. Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, Scotland. In 1385, the king himself led a punitive expedition to the north, but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle. Meanwhile, only an uprising in Ghent prevented a French invasion of southern England. The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of Castile in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person. With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckingham - who had by now been created Duke of Gloucester - and Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel.  The threat of a French invasion did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386. At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Pole - in his capacity of chancellor - requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed. The parliament (later known as the Wonderful Parliament) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel. The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request. Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go. A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.  Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a \\"gyration\\" (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause. By installing de Vere as Justice of Chester, he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in Cheshire. He also secured a legal ruling from Chief Justice Robert Tresilian that parliament's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable.  On his return to London, the king was confronted by Thomas of Woodstock (now Duke of Gloucester), Arundel and Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who brought an appeal of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, Tresilian, and two other loyalists: the mayor of London, Nicholas Brembre, and Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York. Richard stalled the negotiations to gain time, as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements. The three earls then joined forces with Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby (Gaunt's son, later King Henry IV), and Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham - the group known to history as the Lords Appellant. On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at Radcot Bridge, where he and his forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country.  Richard now had no choice but to comply with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were condemned and executed, while de Vere and de la Pole - who had by now also left the country - were sentenced to death in absentia at the Merciless Parliament in February 1388. The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley. The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.\\nQuestion: What changes in the government resulted from the rebellion?.

Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire.

However, by 1981 the insurgents were reduced to sporadic hit-and-run attacks and were finally defeated. In addition, the WSLF and SALF were significantly weakened after the Ogaden War. The former was practically defunct by the late 1980s, with its splinter group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front  operating from headquarters in Kuwait. Even though elements of the ONLF would later manage to slip back into the Ogaden, their actions had little impact. For the Barre regime, the invasion was perhaps the greatest strategic blunder since independence, and it weakened the military. Almost one-third of the regular SNA soldiers, three-eighths of the armored units and half of the Somali Air Force  were lost. The weakness of the Barre administration led it to effectively abandon the dream of a unified Greater Somalia. The failure of the war aggravated discontent with the Barre regime; the first organized opposition group, the Somali Salvation Democratic Front , was formed by army officers in 1979. The United States adopted Somalia as a Cold War ally from the late 1970s to 1988 in exchange for use of Somali bases, and a way to exert influence upon the region.

The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences. A minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after him. A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour. MS Alexandr Pushkin, second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \\"poet\\" or \\"writer\\" class). Station of Tashkent metro was named in his honour.

Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below .\\n\\nParagraph: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model.

This is supported by Bohr's model as well (see Figure below). The fact that an electron can only jump to another fixed distance from nucleus also supports this conclusion.  \\n\\n  In addition, according to Bohr's hypothesis \\"if it [electron] absorbed just the right amount of energy\\", then it will jump to the next highest shell - which applies to both categories"},{"source":"In this task, you are given inputs 'i', 'j', and A, where 'i' and 'j' are integers and A is a list.

John was a pious and dedicated Emperor who was determined to undo the damage to the empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.\\nDuring his twenty-five-year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the West and decisively defeated the Pechenegs at the Battle of Beroia. He thwarted Hungarian and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothair III against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.In the later part of his reign, John focused his activities on the East, personally leading numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. His campaigns fundamentally altered the balance of power in the East, forcing the Turks onto the defensive, while restoring many towns, fortresses, and cities across the peninsula to the Byzantines. He defeated the Danishmend Emirate of Melitene and reconquered all of Cilicia, while forcing Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, to recognise Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the Emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into the Holy Land at the head of the combined forces of the Empire and the Crusader states; yet despite his great vigour pressing the campaign, his hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies. In 1142, John returned to press his claims to Antioch, but he died in the spring of 1143 following a hunting accident.","target":"Komnenos","rationale":"The passage mentions that John was called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius and then goes on to mention his last name, Komnenos.

She won the 1991 AVN Award for Best Group Sex Scene - Video alongside Sunny McKay & Rocco Siffredi for their performance in Buttman's Ultimate Workout. By November 1991 she had appeared in approximately 100 adult films, 60 of which were shot while she was still a minor.\\n Passage 3:In the 18th century, England was famous for its woollen and worsted cloth. That industry, centred in the east and south in towns such as Norwich, jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701 only of cottonwool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to . This was due to commercial legislation to protect the woollen industry. Cheap calico prints, imported by the East India Company from Hindustān (India), had become popular. In 1700 an Act of Parliament passed to prevent the importation of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused demand to switch to imported grey cloth instead—calico that had not been finished—dyed or printed. These were printed with popular patterns in southern England. Also, Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, known as fustian, which they sent to London for finishing. Cottonwool imports recovered though, and by 1720 were almost back to their 1701 levels. Again the woollen manufacturers, in true protectionist fashion, claimed that the imports were taking jobs away from workers in Coventry. The Woollen, etc., Manufactures Act 1720 was passed, enacting fines against anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico muslins. Neckcloths and fustians were exempted. The Lancashire manufacturers exploited this exemption; coloured cotton weft with linen warp were specifically permitted by the 1736 Manchester Act. There now was an artificial demand for woven cloth.","target":"3","rationale":"The question specifically asks about the difference between two types of cloth England was famous for in the 18th century, and passage 3 is the only one that directly talks about England and its production of cloth during that time."},{"source":"I'd like to book a reservation at a restaurant.\\nOkay.

Forty per cent of intravascular blood was withdrawn and liver was sampled by freeze-clamp at 0, 0.25, 1.0, 3.0, and 4.0-5.0 hours. Fed rats with abundant glycogen showed a threefold increase in glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) concentration, and fasted rats showed a 75% decline in G6P immediately after hemorrhage. This significant difference in response traces to the fact that G6P is one of the first catabolites in fed liver formed by glycogenolysis but is the last intermediate of the gluconeogenic pathway in fasted animals. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the high-energy intermediate, was markedly depleted in both fed and fasted rats at zero time. In the fasted animal, however, the PEP was rapidly restored, and by 1.0 hour was threefold above normal. The ability of fasted rats to rapidly synthesize glucose from accumulated lactate is attributed to increased amount of gluconeogenic enzymes induced by fasting. In prolonged shock states, this synthetic capacity plays a protective role. Contrariwise, in brief shock states such as hemorrhage, the immediate availability of glucose from stored glycogen appears to be a more important determinant of survival. In the present experiments, fed rats were more resistant to the hemorrhage protocol.","target":"Animal","rationale":"The main focus of this paper is an investigation into the responses of liver carbohydrate intermediates to severe hemorrhage in fed and fasted young adult male rats.

Originally formed in 1964 as My Backyard in Jacksonville, Florida, the band was also known by names such as The Noble Five and One Percent, before finally deciding on \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd\\" in 1969. The band gained worldwide recognition for its live performances and signature songs \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" and \\"Free Bird\\". At the peak of their success, band members Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines, died in an airplane crash in 1977, putting an abrupt end to the 1970s era of the band.\\n\\nFollowing a performance at the Greenville Memorial Auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, on October 20, 1977, the band boarded a chartered Convair CV-240 bound for Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where they were scheduled to appear at LSU the following night. After running out of fuel they attempted an emergency landing before crashing in a heavily forested area five miles northeast of Gillsburg, Mississippi. Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, along with backup singer Cassie Gaines (Steve's older sister), assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot William Gray were killed on impact; other band members (Collins, Rossington, Wilkeson, Powell, Pyle, and Hawkins), tour manager Ron Eckerman, and several road crew suffered serious injuries.  The accident came just three days after the release of Street Survivors. Following the crash and the ensuing press, Street Survivors became the band's second platinum album and reached No. 5 on the U.S. album chart. The single \\"What's Your Name\\" reached No. 13 on the single charts in 1978. The original cover sleeve for Street Survivors had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, engulfed in flames. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve's widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with the album's back photo, a similar image of the band against a simple black background. Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of Street Survivors, the original \\"flames\\" cover was restored.  Lynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting only on one occasion to perform an instrumental version of \\"Free Bird\\" at Charlie Daniels' Volunteer Jam V in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle performed the song with Charlie Daniels and members of his band.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.\\n\\n- The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family.\\n\\n- Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America.

Morphologically, it is the part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed and which is accordingly modified. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes.\\nInflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern.\\n\\n- The pseudobulb is a storage organ found in many epiphytic and terrestrial sympodial orchids. It is derived from a thickening of the part of a stem between leaf nodes and may be composed of just one internode or several, termed heteroblastic and homoblastic respectively. All leaves and inflorescences usually arise from this structure. Pseudobulbs formed from a single internode produce the leaves and inflorescence from the top, while those that are formed from several internodes can possess leaves along its length. The modified sheath leaves that appear at the base of a pseudobulb and often enfold all or part of it are usually dry and papery, though in some orchids the sheaths bear leaf blades and the leaves at the pseudobulb's apex are reduced to scales.\\n\\n- Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America.

Frost ex Hook. 1829) is a genus of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) from Central and South America. The abbreviation used in horticultural trade is \\"Stan.\\" The genus is named for the 4th Earl of Stanhope (Philip Henry Stanhope) (1781-1855), president of the Medico-Botanical Society of London (1829-1837). It comprises 55 species and 5 natural hybrids. These epiphytic, but occasionally terrestrial orchids can be found in damp forests from Mexico to Trinidad to NW Argentina. Their ovate pseudobulbs carry from the top one long, plicate, elliptic leaf.\\n\\n- In botany, shoots consist of stems including their appendages, the leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds. The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants.\\n\\n- Connation in plants is the developmental fusion of organs of the same type, for example, petals to one another to form a tubular corolla. This is in contrast to adnation, the fusion of dissimilar organs. Such organs are described as connate or adnate, respectively. When like organs that are usually well separated are placed next to each other, but not actually connected, they are described as connivent (that is the case for anthers in several genera, such as \\"Solanum\\").\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'soterosanthus' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?","target":"orchidaceae","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"orchidaceae\\"."},{"source":"Topic from the passage: \\nMargaret Stout and Carrie M.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.\\nThe young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.","target":"Earth I","rationale":"Although both planets are experiencing the greenhouse effect, Earth I is releasing more greenhouse gases.

Claiming that America had declared war against God and his messenger, they called for the murder of any American, anywhere on earth, as the \\"individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.\\" Three months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV,  Bin Laden enlarged on these themes. He claimed it was more important for Muslims to kill Americans than to kill other infidels.\\" It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities,\\" he said. Asked whether he approved of terrorism and of attacks on civilians, he replied:\\"We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans.

The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities.

With an altitude variance of over 7,000 ft (2,100 m), the park has a number of different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately 10,000 ft (3,000 m), tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line to the base of the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park.

His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family.

Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert.

We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\"  Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\"  Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\".\\n\\nWhat was the claim in that case?","target":"This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio.","rationale":"This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio.\\nSo obviously:  This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr.\\""},{"source":"Two analogies that relate items to whether they are trash or treasure is given in the form \\"A : B.

Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.\\n\\n- Henrietta Maria of France (25 November 1609  10 September 1669) was queen consort of England, Scotland, and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I. She was mother of his two immediate successors, Charles II and James II.\\n\\n- Barrier islands are coastal landforms and a type of dune system that are exceptionally flat or lumpy areas of sand that form by wave and tidal action parallel to the mainland coast. They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few islands to more than a dozen. They are subject to change during storms and other action, but absorb energy and protect the coastlines and create areas of protected waters where wetlands may flourish. A barrier chain may extend uninterrupted for over a hundred kilometers, excepting the tidal inlets that separate the islands, the longest and widest being Padre Island of Texas. The length and width of barriers and overall morphology of barrier coasts are related to parameters including tidal range, wave energy, sediment supply, sea-level trends, and basement controls.\\n\\n- The Chincoteague Pony, also known as the Assateague horse, is a breed of pony that developed and lives in a feral condition on Assateague Island in the United States states of Virginia and Maryland. The breed was made famous by the \\"Misty of Chincoteague\\" series written by Marguerite Henry starting in 1947. While phenotypically horse-like, they are commonly called \\"ponies\\". This is due in part to their smaller stature, created by the poor habitat on Assateague Island. Variation is found in their physical characteristics due to blood from different breeds being introduced at various points in their history. They can be any solid color, and are often found in pinto patterns, which are a favorite with breed enthusiasts. Island Chincoteagues live on a diet of salt marsh plants and brush. This poor-quality and often scarce food combined with uncontrolled inbreeding created a propensity for conformation faults in the Chincoteague before outside blood was added beginning in the early 20th century.\\n\\n- Padre Island is the largest of the Texas barrier islands and is the world's longest barrier island. It is part of the U.S. state of Texas. The island is located along Texas' southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and is noted for its white sandy beaches at the south end.

The park was created in 1965 after a strong nor'easter (the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962) destroyed the planned, but never built, resort community of Ocean Beach, Maryland. The national seashore is famous for its white sand beaches and wild ponies.\\n\\n- A nor'easter (also northeaster; see below) is a macro-scale cyclone. The name derives from the direction of the strongest windsas an offshore air mass rotates counterclockwise, winds tend to blow northeast-to-southwest over the region covered by the northwest quadrant of the cyclone. Use of the term in North America is associated with several different types of storms, some of which can form in the North Atlantic Ocean and some of which form as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The term is most often used in the coastal areas of New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Typically, such storms originate as a low-pressure area that forms within of the shore between Georgia and New Jersey. The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other extratropical storms. Noreasters are usually accompanied by very heavy rain or snow, and can cause severe coastal flooding, coastal erosion, hurricane-force winds, or blizzard conditions. Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, and Canadian Maritimes. They thrive on converging air massesthe cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the waterand are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater.\\n\\n- The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is a government agency in the state of Maryland charged with maintaining natural resources including state parks, public lands, state forests, state waterways, wildlife and recreation areas.

It was a fine bell, reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I'd seen in documentaries. And accompanying the bell, I saw a light. Now, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense. First, the whole in-a-vacuum why's-there-a-bell thing. Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright.

Next to those, nothing else mattered. The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better.

He won his first Tony Award for his performance as Henry VIII in the play Anne of the Thousand Days in 1949.\\n\\nHarrison was born at Derry House in Huyton, Lancashire, the son of Edith Mary (nee Carey) and William Reginald Harrison, a cotton broker. He was educated at Liverpool College. After a bout of childhood measles, Harrison lost most of the sight in his left eye, which on one occasion caused some on-stage difficulty. He first appeared on the stage in 1924 in Liverpool. Harrison's acting career was interrupted during World War II while serving in the Royal Air Force, reaching the rank of Flight Lieutenant. He acted in various stage productions until 11 May 1990. He acted in the West End of London when he was young, appearing in the Terence Rattigan play French Without Tears, which proved to be his breakthrough role.  He alternated appearances in London and New York in such plays as Bell, Book and Candle (1950), Venus Observed, The Cocktail Party, The Kingfisher and The Love of Four Colonels, which he also directed. He won his first Tony Award for his appearance at the Shubert Theatre as Henry VIII in Maxwell Anderson's play Anne of the Thousand Days and international superstardom (and a second Tony) for his portrayal of Henry Higgins in the musical My Fair Lady, where he appeared opposite Julie Andrews.  Later appearances included Pirandello's Henry IV, a 1984 appearance at the Haymarket Theatre with Claudette Colbert in Frederick Lonsdale's Aren't We All?, and one on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre presented by Douglas Urbanski, at the Haymarket in J. M. Barrie's The Admirable Crichton with Edward Fox.

Unknown solute(s) retained in renal failure have been extracted from uremic fluids. When added to normal plasma they induce a similar binding defect. Similar activity can be extracted from normal urine. We have devised a series of extraction and purification techniques that yielded three binding inhibitory ligands from normal human urine in sufficient quantity and of a high degree of purity. Rigorous methods have been applied to determine chemical identity of the ligands. Purification steps consisted of: adsorption at pH 3.0 to polystyrene-divinylbenzene resin (XAD-2); elution from the resin with methanol followed by drying and solution in dilute formic acid; passage through SP-Sephadex to remove cations, especially yellow-brown pigments; adsorption to the anion exchanger QAE-Sephadex, and separation into three zones of inhibitory activity with a formic acid gradient; purification to homogeneity with C-8 or C-18 silica reversed-phase chromatography. Using this isolation procedure, followed by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have shown that the binding inhibitory activity is due not to one ligand, but to a family of aromatic acids. To date hippurate, beta-(m-hydroxyphenyl)-hydracrylate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate have been identified as binding inhibitors. Other active ligands remain to be identified. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract describes a series of extraction and purification techniques that were used to identify three binding inhibitory ligands from normal human urine.

The results of the experimental analyses conducted on the purified ligands were characterized based on their molecular weight (mass spectroscopy) and atomic composition (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Therefore, it is likely that data collected from these experiments included both qualitative observations (\\"yellow-brown pigments\\") and quantitative information (molecular weight values obtained by mass spectroscopy).

Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life.

Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.\\n\\nParagraph: Beijing recently significantly increased the amount of cars on the roads there through mandatory price cuts for all motor vehicles.

Passage:Dorothy Eugenia Miner was born in New York City, New York, on 4 November 1904. She attended the Horace Mann School before she enrolled in Barnard College in 1922, receiving her bachelor's degree four years later. Miner became the first Barnard International Fellow and studied at the Bedford College of the University of London. She studied medieval manuscript illumination with Meyer Schapiro at Columbia University in 1928–29 and received a fellowship to continue working on her dissertation on a Carolingian Apocalypse manuscript the following year. Miner was hired by the Pierpont Morgan Library to prepare an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts in 1933–34 and the director of the library, Belle da Costa Greene, recommended her for the position of keeper of manuscripts at the Walters Art Gallery, in Baltimore, Maryland. She got the job and became of the first professionally trained art historians working in an American museum. She was also curator of Islamic and Near Eastern Art as well as the head of the reference library for several years. From 1938 to 1969 Miner edited the Journal of the Walter Gallery and many catalogues published by the museum. She died of cancer in Baltimore in May 1973.","target":"Miner was hired by the Pierpont Morgan Library to prepare an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts in 1933–34 and the director of the library, Belle da Costa Greene, recommended her for the position of keeper of manuscripts at the Walters Art Gallery, in Baltimore, Maryland","rationale":"The sentence \\"Miner was hired by the Pierpont Morgan Library to prepare an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts in 1933–34 and the director of the library, Belle da Costa Greene, recommended her for the position of keeper of manuscripts at the Walters Art Gallery, in Baltimore, Maryland.\\" contains information about Miner's work at Pierpont Morgan Library.

It is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and is located approximately from both Dallas Love Field and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\\n\\n- The American Football Conference (AFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States. This conference and its counterpart, the National Football Conference (NFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL. Both conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger with the rival American Football League (AFL), with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC, and the remaining thirteen NFL clubs forming the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total 16 clubs per each conference.\\n\\n- The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in the DallasFort Worth metroplex. The Cowboys compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team is headquartered in Frisco, Texas, and plays its home games at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, which opened for the 2009 season. The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season. The Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in . The team's national following might best be represented by its NFL record of consecutive sell-outs. The Cowboys' streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular and post-season games (home and away) began in 2002. The franchise shares the record for most Super Bowl appearances (8) with the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots, and the Denver Broncos, corresponding to most NFC championships (8). The Cowboys won five (5) of those Super Bowl appearances, tying them with their NFC rivals, the San Francisco 49ers, both are second to Pittsburgh's record six Super Bowl championships. The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons (196685), in which they only missed the playoffs twice (1974 and 1984), an NFL record that remains unchallenged.\\n\\n- An expansion team is a brand new team in a sports league, usually from a city that has not hosted a team in that league before, formed with the intention of satisfying the demand for a local team from a population in a new area. Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally. The term is most commonly used in reference to the North American major professional sports leagues but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with a closed franchise system of league membership. The term comes from the expansion of the sport into new areas. That sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an expansion draft to populate the new roster.\\n\\n- The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the world. The game is the culmination to a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The next game, Super Bowl LI, scheduled for February 5, 2017, will follow the 2016 regular season.\\n\\n- The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston region.

Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Is the volcanic crust on Sarahn or Timon hotter?","target":"Sarahn","rationale":"This is because at the end of the Proterozoic, \\"the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana.\\" As Sarahn's continental make-up is currently shifting in a way that resembles this.\\nSarahn has more volcanic activity than Timon does as it doesn't have any parts where crust meets craton or two pieces of old ocean floor meet (like how Ordovician period saw glaciation when glaciers covered south pole).\\nTherefore, \\"larger areas of Sarahn’s continent were below sea level.\\""},{"source":"I've always wondered: Renaissance astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus was born in which modern-day European country?","target":"Pols Land","rationale":"The answer is based on modern-day nations, so the country that existed when Nicolaus Copernicus was born should be mapped to its current equivalent. \\nModern Poland corresponds with what used to be called Pols Land.\\nTherefore, the answer should be \\"Poland\\"."},{"source":"Here's a logic test: Jerry goes running on the same road everyday, but during vacation he decided to go running on the beach, he noticed that his time was much slower than normal and came to the conclusion that there was more resistance on (A) the sand (B) the road\\n\\nChoose the answer between \\"sand\\" and \\"road\\".","target":"road","rationale":"A person's running speed depends on the resistance that is felt when they run.

It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \\"Draft Eisenhower\\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \\"I Like Ike\\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated. In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection of Richard M. Nixon as the Vice-President on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose.
