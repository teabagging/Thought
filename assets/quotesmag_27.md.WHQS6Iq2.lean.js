Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark  all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia.\\n\\n- Move to This is the debut album by English dance artist Cathy Dennis.

The Trine forest is a forest tightly packed with trees. Trine has hardly any large open spaces on the ground. The Jimpy forest, on the other hand, is much more open. It has some large areas in the forest that are perfect for camping or for children to play in due to the lack of trees.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from...\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which forest provides more shade?","target":"Trine","rationale":"The first paragraph describes the Trine forest as an area that is tightly packed with trees.

Passage 1:Despite being forced to retire from pro boxing Díaz kept in shape by lifting weights at a local gym. The gym owner was impressed with Díaz physique and work ethics and recommended he become a luchador. Díaz was originally trained by Ray Carrasco and later also trained under Rogelio de la Paz, Genaro Contreas, Raul Rojas and Daniel García; the latter would later be famous under the name of \\"Huracán Ramírez\\". Díaz made his professional wrestling debut in 1954, using the ring name \\"El Pelón\\" (Spanish for \\"Baldy\\") Chato Díaz, then later on worked under names such as \\"Indio\\" Mendoza, El Rayo Rojo and El Hombre del Rayo Rojo. He also worked for a while as an enmascarado (masked) character called Gargantua between 1954 and 1955. In 1955 Díaz came up with the ring name \\"Ray Mendoza\\" after his mentor Ray Carrasco and his wife's maiden name Mendoza. As Mendoza he quickly forged a very effective Rudo character (\\"bad guy\\") by using well developed physique and charisma to create a ring character that the fans loved to hate. In 1956 Mendoza began working for Salvador Lutteroth's Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), the world's oldest and Mexico's largest wrestling promotion. He made his debut at EMLL's main arena Arena Coliseo in February, 1956 in a Battle Royal that also included EMLL headliners Gory Guerrero, El Santo, Cavernario Galindo, Blue Demon and Black Shadow, a match that immediately established him as someone who Lutteroth saw potential in. In EMLL Mendoza struck up a friendship with René Guajardo and Karloff Lagarde out of the ring and a \\"partnership in crime\\" in the ring as the three became one of the most hated trio in lucha libre at the time. The three drew full houses all over Mexico, setting box office record after box office record as they faced técnicos(good guys) such as El Santo, Rayo de Jalisco or Blue Demon. They also had a very financially successful feud with Los Espantos (Espanto I, Espanto II, and Espanto III) in what at the time was a rare rudo vs. rudo feud. Outside the ring Mendoza, Guajardo and Lagarde often spoke out on behalf of the wrestlers, demanding higher pay and better conditions, and since they were able to generate a lot of ticket sales EMLL officials listened to their demands.\\n Passage 2:At the end of the year, he fought in the Battle of Stones River, where he suffered a serious wound that put him out of action for much of 1863. After his recuperation, Smith resumed field duties, but was again wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga in September. After another lengthy recovery period, he returned to action during the 1864 Atlanta Campaign. He was promoted to brigadier general on July 29, 1864, and commanded an infantry brigade (Tyler's Tennessee Brigade), assigned to Bates Division, Hardee's Army Corps in the Army of Tennessee comprising the 2nd, 10th, and 20th Tennessee, the 37th Georgia, the 30th, 37th, and 50th Tennessee, consolidated, and the 4th Georgia battalion of sharpshooters. His first action as a general officer on the extreme left of the Confederate flank at the Battle of Utoy Creek, he personally led his brigade in a charge against attacking Union soldiers capturing some 30 Union soldiers and the colors of the 8th Tennessee Infantry and 112th Illinois Infantry. The unit was cited in the OR by his corps commander, Lieut. Gen. Stephen D. Lee, to whom Bates Division was attached for duty. Smith led his brigade in an assault at the Battle of Jonesborough, however the terrific fire from the Federal entrenched troops, required them to withdraw to a gully for protection during the assault on August 30, 1864 and they were unable to dislodge the Federal Army of the Tennessee.\\n Passage 3:R.

In 1936, after he completed his theological training at St. Michael's College, Llandaff, he was ordained as a priest in the Anglican Church in Wales. From 1936 to 1940 he was the curate of Chirk, Denbighshire, where he met his future wife, Mildred \\"Elsi\\" Eldridge, an English artist.

This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Two friends were in college.

Specifically, my siblings and I. This is basically your typical abusive household where I couldn't even so much as bat an eye and before I knew it, I was a recipient to a backhand square to the face. I firmly believe that my father derived some sort of pleasure or satisfaction by making us and my mother feel inferior and truly undeserving of anything else good in this world. I wasn't exactly deprived but what I did have, was mostly provided by mother that made a living off of scamming people. As far as what she did to sustain us, that is a story for a different day. As time went on, he never actually improved and it got worse. My mom became a literal punching bag for him. My mom was never defiant and besides trying to stand up for herself from time to time, she was pretty docile, for the most part.  I've gathered from most of my uncles and aunts that being raised by my grandparents on my dads side was hard in every sense of the word. They each can recollect a time when they have been subjected to an indiscriminate amount of hatred. When my father would recall memories from his upbringing I would view this from a very empathetic point of view. My father would remember times during his upbringing where he sustained multiple beatings and punishment that felt truly unwarranted. I would like to make it a known fact that I too, have a child of my own. I have never laid a finger on her and as far as I am concerned, I am a firm believer that you can discipline your kids without the need for violence. I should have probably prefaced with this but I am a second generation Mexican-American and living under an abusive household in my culture, is pretty common.  Common in my eyes but not acceptable. I would be more than happy to reveal more details about how shitty it was to grow up in a home where walking on eggshells seemed less of a punishment than what actually took place where I grew up --DM me. Let's fast forward to 8 years later and I get the news that my father is getting deported to Mexico because he is being accused of sodomy, rape and countless other charges by a woman whom he had married after my mother. I have wondered for a while now if the charges against my father were actually true or if he had pissed off his wife to the point where she felt like the only way out was to press charges and get him arrested seemed like the only viable option. Either way, he is currently back in his native country and barely making ends meet. I feel like I need to address the nightmares where I dream of beating up my father and  it varies from dream to dream. In some dreams I beat him to a pulp with my fists  and in other dreams I am bludgeoning with a huge, blunt object to the point where he is almost unrecognizable. I do not wish to have these dreams but they come about, subconsciously. I have researched dream interpretation sites and all of them, for the most part, insist that hatred and resentment on this level, pretty much affirms what I have been feeling all this time. My father has lived in these states well over 20 years so he doesn't know much else. Since his recent deportation, he has had to assimilate and re-adjust to an environment he has not been a part of for a very long time. Because of this, I am receiving a lot of pressure from both my siblings and my relatives to provide for him in a way that would allow for his sustainability. I do not wish for advice. I have adopted a pretty firm stance that I will not provide any support. I have lingered on this topic for far too long. I have never been close to my father and at this interval, I don't care for it much anymore. Would I be so heartless as to say that I don't care whether he lived or died? I am pretty strategic, along with my partner about where most of finances go and cutting into what we currently have going on, would not allow for an additional expense, especially when dealing with another human being.","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"The father has been accused of rape, sodomy and other violent crimes. If the accusations are true, then the father is a clear danger to society and would not be able to provide adequate care for his children.

Therefore, it is ethical for the children to refuse to help their abusive father who may be a danger to them or others.\\\\nIn summary, because of his history of abuse, it seems that the author's decision not to help their abusive father was an ethical choice which prioritized the well-being of other people over helping someone who has hurt many people in their life.

Although no consensus exists as to where that boundary is drawn, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as \\"an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits\\". The term featurette originally applied to a film longer than a short subject, but shorter than a standard feature film.\\n\\n- Featurette is a term used in the American film industry to designate a film usually of three reels in length, or about 2440 minutes in running time, thus longer than a two-reel short subject but shorter than a feature film. Hence, it is a \\"small feature\\" (the ending \\"-ette\\" is a common diminutive suffix derived from French). The term was commonly used from before the start of the sound era into the 1960s, when films of such length as the Hal Roach's Streamlinersand several French films of that lengthceased being made, or were made as experimental or art films and subsumed under the more general rubric of short.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about $30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about $1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale.

Morphogenesis of the epidermis involves cell-cell interactions with internal tissues, such as the developing nervous system and musculature. Genetic analysis of mutants with aberrant epidermal morphology has defined multiple steps in epidermal morphogenesis. In the wild type, epidermal cells are generated on the dorsal side of the embryo among the progeny of four early embryonic blastomeres. Specification of epidermal fate is regulated by a hierarchy of transcription factors. After specification, dorsal epidermal cells rearrange, a process known as dorsal intercalation. Most epidermal cells fuse to generate multinucleate syncytia. The dorsally located epidermal sheet undergoes epiboly to enclose the rest of the embryo in a process known as ventral enclosure; this movement requires both an intact epidermal layer and substrate neuroblasts. At least three distinct types of cellular behavior underlie the enclosure of different regions of the epidermis. Following enclosure, the epidermis elongates, a process driven by coordinated cell shape changes. Epidermal actin microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments all play roles in elongation, as do body wall muscles. The final shape of the epidermis is maintained by the collagenous exoskeleton, secreted by the apical surface of the epidermis.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not have a strict structure.

Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus, the main symptoms of which are illustrated in Figure 37.10. This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas, or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin. This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells, causing high levels of blood glucose, or hyperglycemia (high sugar). High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine, resulting in glucose being lost in urine. High glucose levels also result in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys, causing high amounts of urine to be produced; this may result in dehydration. Over time, high blood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes and peripheral body tissues, as well as damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system. Oversecretion of insulin can cause hypoglycemia, low blood glucose levels. This causes insufficient glucose availability to cells, often leading to muscle weakness, and can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left untreated.\\n\\n\\nQ: Oversecretion of insulin can cause what?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"hypoglycemia","rationale":"Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are two conditions that can result from the body’s inability to properly regulate blood sugar levels.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: What causes clouds to form? And in general, how does matter change from one state to another? As you may have guessed, changes in energy are involved. Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not involve changes in matters chemical makeup or chemical properties. Common changes of state include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and vaporization. These changes are shown in Figure 4.18. Each is described in detail below. Energy is always involved in changes of state. Matter either loses or absorbs energy when it changes from one state to another. For example, when matter changes from a liquid to a solid, it loses energy. The opposite happens when matter changes from a solid to a liquid. For a solid to change to a liquid, matter must absorb energy from its surroundings. The amount of energy in matter can be measured with a thermometer. Thats because a thermometer measures temperature, and temperature is the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. You can learn more about energy, temperature, and changes of state at this URL: [Link] Think about how you would make ice cubes in a tray. First you would fill the tray with water from a tap. Then you would place the tray in the freezer compartment of a refrigerator. The freezer is very cold. What happens next? The warmer water in the tray loses heat to the colder air in the freezer. The water cools until its particles no longer have enough energy to slide past each other. Instead, they remain in fixed positions, locked in place by the forces of attraction between them. The liquid water has changed to solid ice. Another example of liquid water changing to solid ice is pictured in Figure 4.19. The process in which a liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. The temperature at which a liquid changes to a solid is its freezing point. The freezing point of water is 0C (32F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower freezing points. For example, the freezing point of iron is 1535C. The freezing point of oxygen is -219C. If you took ice cubes out of a freezer and left them in a warm room, the ice would absorb energy from the warmer air around it. The energy would allow the particles of frozen water to overcome some of the forces of attraction holding them together. They would be able to slip out of the fixed positions they held as ice. In this way, the solid ice would turn to liquid water. The process in which a solid changes to a liquid is called melting. The melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes to a liquid. For a given type of matter, the melting point is the same as the freezing point. What is the melting point of ice? What is the melting point of iron, pictured in Figure 4.20? If you fill a pot with cool tap water and place the pot on a hot stovetop, the water heats up. Heat energy travels from the stovetop to the pot, and the water absorbs the energy from the pot. What happens to the water next? If water gets hot enough, it starts to boil. Bubbles of water vapor form in boiling water. This happens as particles of liquid water gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them and change to the gaseous state. The bubbles rise through the water and escape from the pot as steam. The process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas is called vaporization. The temperature at which a liquid boils is its boiling point. The boiling point of water is 100C (212F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower boiling points. For example, the boiling point of table salt is 1413C. The boiling point of nitrogen is -196C. A liquid can also change to a gas without boiling. This process is called evaporation. It occurs when particles at the exposed surface of a liquid absorb just enough energy to pull away from the liquid and escape into the air. This happens faster at warmer temperatures. Look at the puddle in Figure 4.21. \\n Question: process in which a liquid changes to a gas without boiling","target":"evaporation","rationale":"The answer can be found in the context passage as \\"A liquid can also change to a gas without boiling.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.","target":"low frequencies","rationale":"The context discusses the process of recording and manufacturing music. It mentions that low frequencies were removed from recorded signals due to limitations in this process, including wider grooves on records which take up more space and limit playing time.

Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink.  Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas.\\nFrancisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible.

He never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. This was due to use of terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops. The Macedonian phalanx, armed with the sarissa, a spear 6 metres (20 ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle, in the manner of a Macedonian king. In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km (1.86 mi). By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persian's scimitars and javelins. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians. At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming.

It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.\\n\\n- Protobactrites is an extinct nautiloid cephalopod belonging to the Orthoceratoidea that lived in what would be Europe and Asia during the Ordovician and Silurian from 466 -- 421.3 mya , existing for approximately 44.7 million years .\\n\\n- The Ascocerida are comparatively small, bizarre Orthoceratoids known only from Ordovician and Silurian sediments in Europe and North America, uniquely characterized by a deciduous conch consisting of a longiconic juvenile portion and an inflated breviconic adult portion that separate sometime in maturity.\\n\\n- The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, Mya. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician-Silurian extinction event when 60% of marine species were wiped out.\\n\\n- Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.\\n\\n- The Lituitida are the Lituitidae of the Treatise (Furnish & Glenister,1964), reranked as an order and combined with other orthoceratoids. They are considered to be more closely related to the Orthocerida than to the Ascocerida or Pseudorthocerida which are also included. \\n\\n- The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian, million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous, Mya. It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied.\\nThe first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \\"Age of Fish\\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placodermi began dominating almost every known aquatic environment.\\n\\n- Pseudorthocerida is an order of generally straight longiconic Orthoceratoids with a subcentral to marginal cyrtochoanitic siphuncle composed of variably expanded segments which may contain internal deposits that may develop into a continuous parietal lining.(Sweet 1964). Cameral deposits are common and concentrated ventrally. Apices typically have a slight to moderate exogastric curvature \\n\\n- The Ordovician is a geologic period and system, the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. The Ordovician spans 41.2 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period million years ago (Mya) to the start of the Silurian Period Mya. The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods, respectively. Lapworth, recognized that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods, and placed them in a period of their own. It received international sanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress.\\n\\n- The Cambrian Period (or ) was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, of the Phanerozoic Eon. The Cambrian lasted 55.6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period mya. Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established (as Cambrian series) by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latinised form of \\"Cymru\\", the Welsh name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätte sedimentary deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where \\"soft\\" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. As a result, our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods.\\n\\n- Orthocerida is an order of extinct Orthoceratoid cephalopods also known as the Michelinocerda that lived from the Early Ordovician possibly to the Late Triassic. A fossil found in the Caucasus suggests they may even have survived until the Early Cretaceous. They were most common however from the Ordovician to the Devonian.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- Orthoceratoidea is a subclass, formerly considered an infraclass or a superorder (Wade 1988), that comprises Cephalopoda orders that have orthoconic to slightly cyrtoconic shells and central to subcentral siphuncles in which there may be internal deposits. Currently, Orthoceratoidea comprises the orders Dissidocerida, Ascocerida, Pseudorthocerida, Lituitida and Orthocerida.\\n\\n- The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .\\n\\n- Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

Six days later, rescue teams found five dead miners and the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), who survived by killing the other miners with a pickaxe, allowing himself to breathe. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines and caused a cave-in, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners.\\nA year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murderous rampage. Soon after, Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) arrives, finding multiple mutilated bodies many of which have been severed in half and the heart of a nurse inside a candy box. Burke and his partner come to the conclusion that Warden had awoken from his coma and, realizing they don't have much time left, they try to figure out where he's headed. Meanwhile, at the abandoned mine shaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend, Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King).

Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or \\"desensitization\\" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Expression of fibrinogen receptors during activation and subsequent desensitization of human platelets by epinephrine. option2: Uptake of hematoporphyrin derivative by atheromatous plaques: studies in human in vitro and rabbit in vivo.","target":"Expression of fibrinogen receptors during activation and subsequent desensitization of human platelets by epinephrine","rationale":"The abstract describes the effects of epinephrine on platelets, including platelet aggregation and expression of fibrinogen receptors.

Shayne Graham later kicked a 20-yard field goal to give Houston the first points of the game. On Chicago's next possession, Michael Bush fumbled, and the Texans recovered again.

The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft.

The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable.

He is the co-creator and lead member of the electronic dancehall music project Major Lazer, and along with producer and DJ Skrillex, part of the electronic duo Jack U. He founded and manages record company Mad Decent, as well as co-founding the non-profit organization Heads Decent. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Philadelphia.\\n\\nDiplo was born on November 10, 1978, in Tupelo, Mississippi, the son of Barbara Jean (nee Cox) and Thomas Pentz. He is of German and English descent. The influence of home-grown rap played a key role in helping shape his production style. He spent the majority of his youth in Miami, where he got a taste for the characteristic Miami bass. He began attending the University of Central Florida in 1997, and then moved to Philadelphia to continue his studies at Temple University, where he first garnered attention as a DJ. After frequently running into fellow DJ Low Budget, the two began throwing parties under the Hooked on Hollertronix moniker in 2003 as a way of maintaining control of what they were able to play during DJ gigs in Philadelphia. The success of these parties allowed the two to release mixtapes, both separate and together, gathering acclaim across the country. One such mixtape, Never Scared, was named one of the New York Times top ten albums of 2003, and the Hollertronix name became synonymous with parties featuring guests like Maluca Mala, Bun B, Spank Rock, M.I.A., among others. Hollertronix's sound has been described as \\"disparate genres to be smashed together for maximum attention-grabbing impact\\" an aesthetic which takes from the \\"organic, cohesive, whole\\" aesthetic of acts such as Bun B, Lil Jon, Drama, M.I.A., Bjork, Busta Rhymes, and others.  Diplo accentuated the club aesthetic of his Hollertronix music for a more reflective sound on his solo debut, Florida, which was released on the Ninja Tune imprint, Big Dada Records. The album Florida was pressed twice, first with a CD and the second with a CD and DVD. The DVD was created by System D-128, another artist who has collaborated with Diplo on some audio and video projects. Before Florida's DVD accompaniment, another DVD surfaced called Diplo: \\"Banned in Libya\\" which was released by Money Studies, the first label to release a solo project by Diplo under his original DJ name Diplodocus. It was a 45 rpm record called \\"Thingamajawn\\" for which there is also a music video System D-128 directed. Similar to the Florida DVD, \\"Banned in Libya\\" is an experimental audio and video mix of some of Diplo's original music blended with a number of other unidentified sources. His particular affinity for one genre of music called baile funk, or favela funk, would spawn a series of mixtapes (Favela on Blast, Favela Strikes Back), which served to bring the Brazilian dance music of the ghettos to the United States.  It was not long before his Hooked on Hollertronix parties would provide him the success necessary to move to the next logical step and build a studio where music would become his full-time focus. With this goal in mind, Diplo built \\"The Mausoleum,\\" a video studio, recording studio, record label office, gallery, and event space in Philadelphia. Since its inception, The Mausoleum has become the home to recordings by artists like Christina Aguilera, Shakira, M.I.A., Santigold, Spank Rock, Plastic Little, Blaqstarr, Paper Route Gangstaz, and hosted concerts by Glass Candy, Skream, Boys Noize, Nicos Gun, and more.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Diplo","rationale":"The paragraph is about Diplo.

In contrast, the related mammalian DNA polymerase beta does not form a complex with Ku and XRCC4-ligase IV and is less effective than pol mu in facilitating joining mediated by these factors.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...","target":"Ronald","rationale":"The answer is Ronald, as it states that Saint-Saëns's operas are important in the history of French opera."},{"source":"Given a passage classify if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal or not.

Evidence suggests that therapeutic hypothermia improves neurological outcome in these patients. In this analysis, we investigate whether therapeutic hypothermia influences the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and ventilator time in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.', 'A prospective observational study with historical controls was conducted at our medical ICU. Fifty-two consecutive patients (median age 62.6 years, 43 males, 34 ventricular fibrillation) submitted to therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were included. They were compared with a historical cohort (n = 74, median age 63.8 years, 53 males, 43 ventricular fibrillation) treated in the era prior to hypothermia treatment. All patients received the same standard of care. Neurological outcome was assessed using the Pittsburgh cerebral performance category (CPC) score. Univariate analyses and multiple regression models were used.', 'In survivors, therapeutic hypothermia and baseline disease severity (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II [APACHE II] score) were both found to significantly influence ICU stay and ventilator time (all P < 0.01). ICU stay was shorter in survivors receiving therapeutic hypothermia (median 14 days [interquartile range (IQR) 8 to 26] versus 21 days [IQR 15 to 30] in the control group; P = 0.017). ICU length of stay and time on ventilator were prolonged in patients with CPC 3 or 4 compared with patients with CPC 1 or 2 (P = 0.003 and P = 0.034, respectively).

Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.\\n\\nEven though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss.

There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\".

According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.\\n\\n- British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"\\n\\n- International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and between nations. It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts.\\n\\n- Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\\nRights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\".\\n\\n- The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. John Locke defined freedom under the rule of law as follows:\\n\\n- Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"\\n\\n- Human rights are moral principles or norms, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \\"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,\\" and which are \\"inherent in all human beings\\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.\\n\\n- A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions.

In this paper, for the first time, we theoretically analyze the connections between GCN and matrix factorization (MF), and unify GCN as matrix factorization with co-training and unitization. Moreover, under the guidance of this theoretical analysis, we propose an alternative model to GCN named Co-training and Unitized Matrix Factorization (CUMF). The correctness of our analysis is verified by thorough experiments. The experimental results show that CUMF achieves similar or superior performances compared to GCN. In addition, CUMF inherits the benefits of MF-based methods to naturally support constructing mini-batches, and is more friendly to distributed computing comparing with GCN. The distributed CUMF on semi-supervised node classification significantly outperforms distributed GCN methods. Thus, CUMF greatly benefits large scale and complex real-world applications.","target":"We unify graph convolutional networks as co-training and unitized matrix factorization","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe unify graph convolutional networks as co-training and unitized matrix factorization."},{"source":"Write the response.

Passage:He led the 1901-1904 Swedish Antarctic Expedition, aboard the ship Antarctic. The expedition visited the Falkland Islands before the ship, commanded by seasoned Antarctic sailor Carl Anton Larsen, dropped Nordenskjöld's party off at Snow Hill Island, a small island off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Nordenskiöld overwintered at Snow Hill Island, while Antarctic returned to the Falklands. The following summer Larsen brought her south, intending to retrieve the Nordenskiöld party, but she became trapped in ice which eventually crushed her hull, forcing Larsen and his crew to overwinter in a hastily constructed shelter on Paulet Island. Larsen and Nordenskjöld finally rendezvoused at their fall-back rescue hut at Hope Bay in late 1903, where they were picked up by the Argentine Navy corvette ARA Uruguay (commanded by Julián Irízar), which had been dispatched when Antarctic had failed to make her appointed return to South America the previous year. Despite its end and the great hardships endured, the expedition was considered a scientific success, with the parties having explored much of the eastern coast of Graham Land, including Cape Longing, James Ross Island, the Joinville Island group, and the Palmer Archipelago. The expedition, which also recovered valuable geological samples and samples of marine animals, earned Nordenskjöld lasting fame at home, but its huge cost left him greatly in debt.\\n Links: a.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

Dreams don't pay the bills, so he's ended up as the lead singer and guitarist of a blackened death metal band, \\"Detroit Metal City.\\" In stage costume he is Johannes Krauser II, rumored to be a terrorist demon from hell, to have killed and raped his parents, to wield his giant death penis with abandon, and other menacing tales being said about him after each public performance. The songs of DMC often encourage the audience to engage in immoral and illegal behavior, such as rape or murder, or tell of Krauser's exploits with similar actions, in a parody of the genre.\\nNegishi despises DMC and all that it stands for, but he can't walk away as he has a talent to play the psychotic frontman of the band. Negishi is under his meager exterior a rageaholic and also is very skilled in his guitar play. Further, he feels obligation to the rest of the band and his label and even if he manages to escape, he is invariably roped back in by the manager of the band's label. The Krauser persona also functions as an outlet to vent his frustration over his failing personal career, which has not advanced beyond him being a street musician. Playing his music in the street earns him nothing but the disapproval of bystanders over his cheesy pop songs.\\nNegishi is envious of the popularity DMC and his Krauser persona enjoy in contrast to the music he actually wants to play being ridiculed, which in turn leads to his Krauser persona coming out more often, which leads to Krauser's popularity growing.

His father was an oil-refinery refrigeration worker, and a skilled fiddle and accordion player, who often entertained in local New York City dance halls. By age twelve Rabbitt was a proficient guitar player, having been taught by his scoutmaster, Bob Scwickrath. During his childhood Rabbitt became a self-proclaimed \\"walking encyclopedia of country music\\".\\n\\nRabbitt was employed as a mental hospital attendant in the late 1950s but, like his father, he fulfilled his love of music by performing at the Six Steps Down club in his hometown. He later won a talent contest and was given an hour of Saturday night radio show time to broadcast a live performance from a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. In 1964, he signed his first record deal with 20th Century Records and released the singles, \\"Next to the Note\\" and \\"Six Nights and Seven Days\\". Four years later, with $1,000.00 to his name, Rabbitt moved to Nashville where he began his career as a songwriter. During his first night in the town, Rabbitt wrote \\"Working My Way Up to the Bottom\\", which Roy Drusky recorded in 1968. To support himself, Rabbitt worked as a truck driver, soda jerk and fruit picker while in Nashville. He was ultimately hired as a staff writer for the Hill & Range Publishing Company and received a salary of $37.50 per week. As a young songwriter, Rabbitt socialized with other aspiring writers at Wally's Clubhouse, a bar in Nashville; he said that he and the other patrons had \\"no place else to go.\\"  Rabbitt became successful as a songwriter in 1969 when Elvis Presley recorded his song \\"Kentucky Rain\\". The song went gold and cast Rabbitt as one of Nashville's leading young songwriters. While eating Cap'n Crunch, he penned \\"Pure Love\\", which Ronnie Milsap rode to No. 1 in 1974. This song led to a contract offer from Elektra Records.  Rabbitt signed with Elektra Records in 1975. His first single under that label, \\"You Get To Me\\" made the top 40 that year, and two songs in 1975, \\"Forgive and Forget\\" and \\"I Should Have Married You\\" nearly made the top 10. These three songs along with a recording of \\"Pure Love\\" were included on Rabbitt's self-named debut album in 1975. In 1976 his critically acclaimed Rocky Mountain Music album was released, which handed Rabbitt his first No. 1 country hit with the track \\"Drinkin' My Baby (Off My Mind)\\". In 1977 his third album, Rabbitt was released, which made the top 5 on Country Albums chart. Also in 1977 the Academy of Country Music named Rabbitt \\"Top New Male Vocalist of the Year\\". By that time he had a good reputation in Nashville, and was being compared by critics to singer Kris Kristofferson. In 1977, at Knott's Berry Farm, Eddie Rabbitt appeared at the CMA and sang several of his songs from the album Rocky Mountain Music. He won the award of Top New Male Vocalist of the Year.\\n\\nHow long did it last?","target":"an hour","rationale":"From the context, we can infer that Rabbitt won a contest and was allowed 1 hour of radio time to broadcast live.

However, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s. He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.\\n\\nNow answer this question: When was stochastic computing introduced?","target":"1953","rationale":"The paragraph states that stochastic computing was first introduced in a paper by von Neumann.

Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically.

Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts.\\" Both sides of the album begin with three shorter, hook-driven songs, which Stylus Magazine's Evan Chakroff said veer between progressive rock and post-punk styles.

Their dual playing draws on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of contemporary punk rock in favor of melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine's guitar establishes the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd is heard playing dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos by the time they recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. Some songs have the two guitarists trading rhythmic and melodic lines several times while producing tension. \\"There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and forth, like a jigsaw puzzle\\", Lloyd said.Most of the solos on Marquee Moon follow a pattern wherein Verlaine runs up a major scale but...","target":"Verlaine","rationale":"The text talks about the musical style of the band Television, which is noted for its dual guitar playing between Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd.

When Johnny walks over to Drum B, his Geiger counter starts making rapid sounds. Johnny thinks maybe he should not have invested in these barrels.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich drum is giving off less radiation?\\n\\nHint: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.","target":"Drum A","rationale":"A Geiger counter makes a sound to indicate the presence of radiation. This device is used in situations where an individual wants to know if an object emits radiation, but cannot sense it with their senses (smell, touch, etc.) The faster the clicks occur on Johnny's Geiger counter when placed over Drum B indicates that there is higher level of radiation emitted from this container than Drum A because its clicking sounds are loud and fast while they are slow and steady near drum A.\\nGiven these facts about how Johnny uses his new equipment we can infer that he should invest more time looking at what may be inside drum \\"B\\"."},{"source":"Write a brief sentence.","target":"A cowboy is performing an athletic feat.","rationale":"Here is an example of a simple statement: A cowboy is performing an athletic feat."},{"source":"What is the solution to this math problem?\\nSolve 17*d = -22 + 80 + 95 for d.","target":"9","rationale":"17d = -22 + 80 + 95\\n    17d = 153\\n      d = 9"},{"source":"Question: The string was less flexible than the fishing line so it was (A) less breakable (B) more breakable\\n\\nDo not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"String\\" and  \\"Fishing Line\\".","target":"Fishing Line","rationale":"The answer is Fishing Line. \\"String\\" and  \\"Fishing line\\" are the words that can be used to complete the question without any changes in meaning of sentence.

The concentration of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide also increased during viloxazine therapy, but to a lesser extent (16%). In three patients, these effects were associated with symptoms of carbamazepine intoxication, which regressed rapidly when plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide levels returned to baseline values after discontinuation of viloxazine. In a seventh patient, viloxazine had to be discontinued after only two weeks because of severe side effects associated with a striking elevation of carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide levels (by 197% and 137% respectively). Although viloxazine appears to be one of the few antidepressants which can be used safely in patients with epilepsy these results indicate that the drug should be prescribed with great caution in subjects treated with carbamazepine.

To clear the reasons, we analyzed the effect of the skip-connection in ResNet and the BN on the data separation ability, which is an important ability for the classification problem. Our results show that, in the multilayer perceptron with randomly initialized weights, the angle between two input vectors converges to zero in an exponential order of its depth, that the skip-connection makes this exponential decrease into a sub-exponential decrease, and that the BN relaxes this sub-exponential decrease into a reciprocal decrease.

If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.","target":"overcast","rationale":"Overcast skies occur when there is a thick layer of clouds that block the sun. \\nIf Michael was unable to see his shadow, it means he could not see direct radiation from the Sun because it would have been blocked by cloud cover in an overcast sky."},{"source":"Given a sentence, fill out the missing word with a 'no' or a number (between zero and ten).

Subjective comfort and symptoms were assessed after 2 and 4 weeks with each product. After 1 month of wear with each product, lenses were collected and analyzed in the laboratory for total protein, total lysozyme, and percentage of denatured lysozyme.', 'Symptoms of dryness and comfort varied across the day regardless of drop type (p < 0.001) with dryness being maximal on waking, least in the middle of the day, and increased towards the evening. The test RWD provided greater comfort on insertion (p = 0.02), better visual quality (p < 0.01), and less mucous discharge on waking (p = 0.02) than the control product. Lysozyme deposition was significantly reduced after the use of the test RWD as compared to saline (0.73 +/- 0.5 microg/lens vs. 1.14 +/- 0.7 microg/lens; p < 0.001) as was total protein deposition (1.17 +/- 0.7 microg/lens vs. 1.86 +/- 0.8 microg/lens; p < 0.001).

This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers.\\nThe Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by Alfonso in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court.

In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

Scientists have found the gene that determines skin color1.\\n    The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 percent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 percent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of science.\\n    Scientists have changed the color1 of a dark-striped zebrafish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebrafish skin color1 is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanin  . The number, size and darkness of melanin per pigment cell determine skin color1.\\n    It appears that, like the golden zebrafish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation   in the gene for melanin production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebrafish genes.\\n    Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun , which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng.\\n    \\"Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin color1,\\" said Cheng.\\n    The new discovery could lead to medical treatments for skin cancer. It also could lead to research into ways to change skin color1 without damaging it like chemical treatment did on Michael Jackson. ks5u\\nScientists have done an experiment on a dark-striped zebrafish in order to   _  .\\nA) find the different genes of humans'\\nB) prove the humans' skin color1 is similar to that of zebrafish in its formation\\nC) find out the reason why the Africans' skin color1 is dark\\nD) find out the ways of changing people's skin color1","target":"B","rationale":"The article discusses how scientists are exploring the gene that determines skin color and its impact on pigmentation.

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under $1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable.

The SEC participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I in sports competitions; for football, it is part of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A.\\n\\n- The 2002 Missouri Tigers football team represented the University of Missouri during the 2002 NCAA Division I - A football season . They played their home games at Faurot Field in Columbia , Missouri . They were members of the Big 12 Conference in the North Division . The team was coached by head coach Gary Pinkel .\\n\\n- Faurot Field , at Memorial Stadium is a stadium in Columbia, Missouri, United States, on the campus of the University of Missouri. It is primarily used for football and serves as the home field for the Missouri Tigers football program. In 1972, Memorial Stadium's playing surface was named Faurot Field in honor of longtime coach Don Faurot. During the offseason, soccer goals are set up in the end zones and it is used for intramural matches. Until 2012 it was the site of the annual \\"Providence Bowl\\" game between Hickman and Rock Bridge high schools, so named because both schools are located on Providence Road in Columbia, and Faurot is roughly equidistant between the two. This tradition stopped when Missouri joined the Southeastern Conference and conference scheduling made hosting the game more difficult. Faurot Field was also been home to the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) football championships for many years, now held in St. Louis in the climate-controlled Edward Jones Dome. It is the second-largest sports facility by seating capacity in the state of Missouri, to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. \\n\\n- A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to \\"play this tune as though you've never heard it before.\\" A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.A late piece of Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books.\\nIn his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion.

After the final provisions were taken on board, Nansen, Sverdrup, Hansen and Blessing spent their last hours ashore in a sauna, being beaten with birch twigs by two young girls.The first leg of the journey eastward took Fram across the Barents Sea towards Novaya Zemlya and then to the North Russian settlement of Khabarova where the first batch of dogs was brought on board.  On 3 August Fram weighed anchor and moved cautiously eastward, entering the Kara Sea the next day. Few ships had sailed the Kara Sea before, and charts were incomplete. On 18 August, in the area of the Yenisei River delta, an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander. Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned. The crew also experienced the dead water phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by energy dissipation caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water. On 9 September a wide stretch of ice-free water opened up, and next day Fram rounded Cape Chelyuskin—the second ship to do so, after Nordenskiöld's..., what would be the answer ?","target":"Sverdrup Island","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"Sverdrup Island is a small island, located between Vankarem and Nansen Islands of the New Siberian Islands archipelago.

What was the best excuse that a student ever gave for having failed to do something? I would have to say that I was most entertained by a student’s response to “Why are you late for school?” The student said, “I awoke in time this morning but there was a mouse sitting on the edge of my bed. I looked at him and he looked back. The mouse said to me, ‘Go back to sleep’ and what could I do? He had a gun.”\\nThe following has worked a few times too when students refuse to talk. That is, I know that one of the assembled students was the culprit for some activity. When they will not talk, I interview them one at a time while the others are kept away from each other.

Not long being there, me, my roommate and another girl in our hall sort of formed a friend group. We would go to the dining hall together, go to plays, go out to eat, etc. I thought we were getting along well. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHowever, I did notice that the other two were closer. It sort of made sense, since they were the same major and had a lot in common, and it didn't bother me too much at first.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThen, I noticed things were off. They would talk about things in front of me that I didn't know anything about, and be sort of vague so I couldn't really catch up.

But I feel like the answer is pretty obvious (they don't want to hang out with me), and calling them out on it would only make things more awkward between us, especially since I still have to live with my roommate for the rest of the year.

Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.","target":"Ibn Sina","rationale":"Ibn Sina is the name of a person who proposed explanations for the origins of earthquakes and the formation of mountains.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- Kingfishers are a group of small to medium-sized, brightly colored birds in the order Coraciiformes. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species found outside of the Americas. The group is treated either as a single family, the Alcedinidae, or as a suborder Alcedines containing three families, Alcedinidae (river kingfishers), Halcyonidae (tree kingfishers), and Cerylidae (water kingfishers). Roughly 90 species of kingfishers are described. All have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with few differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests. They consume a wide range of prey, as well as fish, usually caught by swooping down from a perch. While kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish, most species live away from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other members of their order, they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of all kingfishers nest in abandoned termite nests. A few species, principally insular forms, are threatened with extinction. In Britain, the word \\"kingfisher\\" normally refers to the common kingfisher.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- The African pygmy kingfisher (\\"Ispidina picta\\") is a small insectivorous kingfisher found in the Afrotropics, mostly in woodland habitats. Some texts refer to this species as \\"Ceyx pictus\\".\\n\\n- Woodland is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests. \\n\\n- Ispidina is a genus of very small insectivorous African water kingfishers .

Passage 1:Consequently, to the end of World War I in 1918 various proposals emerged defining the division of Upper Silesia. At the Paris Peace Conference a commission for Polish affairs was created to prepare proposals for Polish borders. In their first two proposals (of 27 March 1919 and of 7 May 1919) most of the future province was ceded, together with the region of Oppeln, to Poland. Yet that was not accepted by the Big Four, and following David Lloyd George's suggestion, the plebiscite was organized. Before it took place on 20 March 1921, two Silesian Insurrections instigated by Polish inhabitants of the area were organized. After the referendum, in which Poland had 41% of the votes, a plan of division was created that divided Upper Silesia. Following this, the Third Silesian Uprising took place. The Inter-Allied Commission on Upper Silesia, headed by the French general Henri Le Rond suggested a new plan for division of the area, which was prepared by an ambassadors commission in Paris on 20 October 1921. The division - which became effective by 20 June 1922 - still created a situation in which some rural territories that voted mostly for Poland were granted to Germany and some urban territories with a German majority were granted to Poland. The Polish Sejm decided that the eastern-most Upper Silesian areas should become an autonomous area within Poland organised as the Silesian Voivodeship and with Silesian Parliament as a constituency and Silesian Voivodeship Council as the executive body. The part of Silesia awarded to Poland was by far the best-developed and richest region of the newly formed state, producing most of Poland's industrial output. Consequently, to the division in 1922, the German-Polish Accord on East Silesia (Geneva Convention) was concluded on 15 May 1922 which dealt with the constitutional and legal future of Upper Silesia as it has partly became Polish territory.\\n Passage 2:Holly Holliday is a recurring fictional character from the Fox musical comedy-drama series, Glee.

Rome, meanwhile, was preoccupied with Carthage, and Philip hoped to take advantage of this to seize control of the Greek world. He knew that his ambitions would be aided by an alliance with Crete and began pressing the Cretans to attack Rhodian assets. Having crushed Pergamum, the dominant Greek state in Asia Minor, and formed an alliance with Aetolia, Philip was now opposed by no major Greek power other than Rhodes. Rhodes, an island state that dominated the south-eastern Mediterranean economically and militarily, was formally allied to Philip, but was also allied to his enemy Rome. Furthermore, Philip worked towards consolidating his position as the major power in the Balkans. Marching his forces to Macedon's northern frontier, he inflicted a crushing defeat on the Illyrians, who lost 10,000 men in battle. With his northern frontier secured, Philip was able to turn his attention towards the Aegean Sea.","target":"2","rationale":"The question asks which season of the show Glee that Holly Holliday appeared in had the highest average tv ratings.

Classical Palmyra had a distinctive culture, based on a local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome. To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or in addition to a second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a \\"boule\\" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.\\nThe culture of Persia influenced Palmyrene military tactics, dress and court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern cities such as Edessa or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was Cassius Longinus.Palmyra had a large agora. However, unlike the Greek Agoras (public gathering places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used in some of the tombs.

A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.\\n\\n- Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses.

The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song.\\n\\n- Jerome Robbins (October 11, 1918  July 29, 1998) was an American choreographer, director, dancer, and theater producer who worked in classical ballet, on Broadway, and in films and television.

In the 1960 film version the roles were played by Rita Moreno and Natalie Wood , but the songs were dubbed by Betty Wand and Marni Nixon ( as both Anita and Maria ) . However , the repeat of the two stanzas , sung by Anita , along with Maria 's counterpoint of her defense , was omitted because of the complexity of the song , as well as to avoid the repetition , which would have slowed down the pace of the film .\\n\\n- Splendor in the Grass is a 1961 Technicolor romantic drama film that tells a story of a teenage girl navigating her feelings of sexual repression, love, and heartbreak.

PBS broadcast 780 episodes over the course of its six seasons from October 25, 1971, to April 15, 1977. (In many areas, a preview special, \\"Here Comes The Electric Company\\" (pilot episode), was seen in syndication through sponsor Johnson Wax on many local commercial stations during the week before its 1971 debut.) After it ceased production in 1977, the program continued in reruns until July 5, 1985, as the result of a decision made in 1975 to produce two final seasons for perpetual use. The Workshop produced the show at Second Stage, located within the Reeves Teletape Studios (Teletape), in Manhattan, which had been the first home of \\"Sesame Street.\\"\\n\\n- Chita Rivera (born January 23, 1933) is an American actress, dancer, and singer best known for her roles in musical theatre.

It commonly applies to countries once colonized by the Spanish Empire in the Americas (see Spanish colonization of the Americas) and Asia, particularly the countries of Latin America and the Philippines. It could be argued that the term should apply to all Spanish-speaking cultures or countries, as the historical roots of the word specifically pertain to the Iberian region. It is difficult to label a nation or culture with one term, such as \\"Hispanic\\", as the ethnicities, customs, traditions, and art forms (music, literature, dress, architecture, cuisine, and others) vary greatly by country and region. The Spanish language and Spanish culture are the main traditions.\\n\\n- The Presidential Medal of Freedom is an award bestowed by the President of the United States and isalong with the \\ncomparable Congressional Gold Medalthe highest civilian award of the United States.

Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

POST : This happened today and I’m still confused about whether or not I’ve actually done anything wrong.\\n\\nThis morning, I was supposed to go back to university about 2 hours away from my hometown.

My mum comes to nag me twice more as I attempt to get everything packed.\\n\\nAt 9:50, she gives me an ultimatum: get everything downstairs and in the car in 5 minutes, or she’ll leave without me. At this point, I am almost completely packed, save for a few things still to round up. I try to tell her this to convince her to wait a little longer, but she just reiterates her ultimatum.\\n\\n9:55 comes around, and I have finished everything but the suitcase. My mum, however, has had enough and storms off. She leaves without me, leaving me feeling pretty pissed off that she couldn’t just wait a few more minutes for me, or help me take stuff downstairs instead of just standing at the door glaring at me, especially seeing as I finished packing at about 10 past 10.\\n\\nNow my mum is asking me to “apologise for my behaviour” before she’ll take me back to university tomorrow.\\n\\nAITA for not getting ready sooner, or am I right in thinking that I actually haven’t done anything wrong, much less anything worth apologising for?","target":"no","rationale":"The author of the post describes a mother who is hurrying the author to pack for university.

Passage:He was first elected to the Knesset in 1996 as a member of the right-wing Moledet Party, advocating voluntary transfer of Palestinian population from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (an ideology shared by Elon). In 1999, the party allied with other right-wing parties to form the National Union party. Following the assassination of Moledet leader Rehavam Ze'evi in 2001, Elon was elected to replace him as party chairman and as Tourism Minister. He consequently served two terms as Minister of Tourism, between 2001 and 2002, and again between 2003 and 2004, both in Ariel Sharon's government. During his second spell in the cabinet, Elon attempted to foil Ariel Sharon's plan to dismiss him from the cabinet for intending to vote against the disengagement plan by going into hiding, claiming if he did not receive his dismissal in person within 48 hours of the cabinet meeting, then he would still be able to vote. Ultimately, his dismissal was deemed legal, and he was not allowed to vote in the meeting. He was re-elected in 2006, but did not run in the 2009 elections due to health issues.","target":"a","rationale":"The Knesset is the unicameral national legislature of Israel.

A chemical reaction or physical change is endothermic if heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings. In the course of an endothermic process, the system gains heat from the surroundings and so the temperature of the surroundings decreases. The quantity of heat for a process is represented by the letter . The sign of for an endothermic process is positive because the system is gaining heat.

Because the surroundings is gaining heat from the system, the temperature of the surroundings increases.

Passage 1:After going 6–6 in 2006, the Wildcats lost three of their first four games in 2007, including a 29–27 loss at home to New Mexico. In that game, Stoops gained a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for his behavior on the sideline, which led to a New Mexico touchdown. Following a 2007, 21–20 home loss to Stanford, dropping the team to 2–6, local media began speculating as to whether Stoops would be fired. However, subsequent statements by the athletic director and the university's president indicated that Stoops would return for an additional season. At the beginning of the season, many believed this to be the year Stoops and the Wildcats would reach their first college bowl game in a decade; a winning season was considered a must in order for Stoops to remain as Wildcats head coach. Under the direction of Stoops, Arizona scored 70 points in the season opener against the Idaho Vandals, falling just four points short of a school record for points scored in a game. They went on to soundly defeat Toledo, UCLA, Washington, and California, but lost close games to New Mexico and Stanford. They went on to defeat Washington State on the road to secure bowl eligibility at six wins, but lost to Oregon on the road after mounting a dramatic second-half come-from-behind rally, and to Oregon State in Tucson on a last-second field goal. The Wildcats' final game of the regular season was a 31–10 victory on December 6 in Tucson against Arizona State in the annual Territorial Cup rivalry game. With that win and a final regular season record of 7–5, Arizona accepted a bid from to the Las Vegas Bowl to face BYU. It was the Wildcats' first bowl appearance since the 1998 Holiday Bowl. Stoops' reputation in Tucson was mixed; while the Wildcats had a winning record and appeared in and won their first bowl game in ten years, many fans were divided during the season on whether he should be retained as head coach, as they expected Stoops to guide the team to an eight, nine or even ten-win season given the talent level and the offensive and defensive systems employed by the Wildcats (and with the overall talent level in the Pac-10 conference perceived to be not as strong as usual in 2008). While Stoops brought the Wildcat football program to a level of respectability which was lost during the era of John Mackovic, some fans were disappointed the program was not at the elite level of Stoops' former program Oklahoma or of perennial Pac-10 football power USC. However, Stoops was given strong votes of confidence by UA (later UNLV) athletic director Jim Livengood, by university president Dr. Robert Shelton, and by several prominent Arizona football boosters.\\n Passage 2:On 4 May 1918, in the aftermath of the Finnish Civil War, Silatch arrived secretly in Kotka, Finland, to evacuate remaining members of the Finnish Red Guard. However, she was confiscated by the Finns and joined the Finnish icebreaker fleet as Ilmarinen, after the legendary hero from Kalevala. In December 1919 she was sent to Koivisto to assist three Finnish torpedo boats, C1, C2 and C3 that had been surrounded by ice some thick. The 150-ton torpedo boats had participated in the British campaign in the Baltic, and Admiral Walter Cowan had demanded that the Finnish squadron patrolling the area had to stay until the British forces had withdrawn. Despite the efforts of Ilmarinen, the weak-hulled torpedo boats were crushed by the ice, and the newly founded Finnish Navy lost one fifth of its ships. After the winter of 1919 Ilmarinen was laid up until she was returned to the Soviet Union according to the Treaty of Tartu. In turn the Soviets gave back the Finnish icebreaker Avance. The name Ilmarinen was later given to a Finnish coastal defence ship launched in 1931.\\n Passage 3:The present-day Angels franchise began play as the Los Angeles Angels in .

During the season, Gene Autry struck a deal with the suburban city of Anaheim on a new stadium for the Angels.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Two farmers, Tom and Brad, applied different farming methods.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a...","target":"Coleman","rationale":"The question asks for the last name of a person who started to incorporate non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians into his music.

In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: The two counties both had budgetary constrains, but Clark county invested more in skilled officers, IT equipment and training, so they had better results at the end of the 2 year test period.

The other three choices are not correct because covering the pan would only slow down evaporation rather than make it faster; placing anything in dark will have no effect on speed of evaporation; putting salt like sodium chloride ([NaCl]) into water makes no difference since table salt has very low vapor pressure so that NaCl does not contribute significantly to reducing internal pressure within solution relative to surrounding atmospheric pressure"},{"source":"Are Shout Out Louds and Sick Puppies from the same country?","target":"no","rationale":"The fact that Shout Out Louds is from Sweden, and Sick Puppies are from Australia means that the two groups cannot be from the same country. \\nShout out louds were formed in Stockholm, Sweden, so they must come from a city within Sweden or at least its surrounding area.

This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December. The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the ozone into other gases.Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Blimpton and Jarmel are two neighboring planets in the Harshlan galaxy. Aliens are currently studying the two planets to see if either of them are suitable for habitation. While studying the planets, they discover that both planets have the same type of atmosphere.

The current species of animals on Blimpton emit much more chlorofluorocarbons than Jarmel's animals do, which means that there will be higher concentrations of chlorine compounds in the atmosphere over Blimpton. Chlorine compounds can react with and “destroy” (decompose) some molecules of ozone leading to a decrease in overall concentration and thus creating an area where less ultraviolet radiation from the sun is absorbed and reflected away from Earth, i.e., an \\"ozone hole\\". This causes temperatures to drop below normal levels resulting in colder climates especially at lower altitudes around Antarctica; therefore making it cooler than its neighboring planet Jarmel whose oxygen cycle proceeds normally"},{"source":"Text: Old Testament -- The Old Testament is considered one of the most important and influential works of literature in world literature, and has provided inspiration for writers (both religious and secular) throughout subsequent history.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \\nQuestion: Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago near Lisbon following the orders of which leader?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

Radial piston pumps used in cars and trucks are fuel lubricated, this helps with keeping oil out of the high pressure fuel. Oil in the fuel can raise emissions and clog injectors. Many diesel engines are common rail, which means all the injectors are supplied by one pipe full of high pressure fuel supplied by the fuel pump. Common rails dampen the pressure fluctuations when fuel is used by each injector and pumped into the cylinder. Common rails also make it easier for the fuel pressure to be measured by one device instead of one per cylinder. Port and Helix (plunger type) high pressure fuel pumps are most commonly used in marine diesels because of their simplicity, reliability, and its ability to be scaled up in proportion to the engine size.\\n\\nAnswer the following yes/no question: does a diesel engine have a fuel pump?

We present recent evidence implicating virally encoded and host-derived ncRNAs in viral replication and pathogenesis regulation, focusing on four different viral diseases (IAV, KHSV, HIV, and HBV). Finally, we discuss the current knowledge of ncRNAs modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection.

The shows are of the tokusatsu genre, featuring live action characters and colorful special effects, and are aimed at children. The Super Sentai Series is one of the most prominent tokusatsu franchises in Japan, alongside the Ultra Series and the Kamen Rider Series, which it currently airs alongside in the \\"Super Hero Time\\" programming block on Sundays. Outside Japan, the Super Sentai Series is best known as the source material for the \\"Power Rangers\\" franchise.\\n\\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\\n\\n- Although \\"Ultraman\\" is the first series to feature an Ultra-Crusader, it is actually the \\"second\\" show in the Ultra Series. \\"Ultra Q\\" was the first. In fact, \\"Ultraman\\" opens with the \\"Ultra Q\\" logo exploding into the \\"Ultraman\\" logo. \\"Ultraman\\", and its titular hero, became a major pop culture phenomenon in Japan, spawning dozens of sequels, spin-offs, imitators, parodies and remakes.\\n\\n- \\"Tokusatsu\\" entertainment often deals with science fiction, fantasy or horror, but movies and television shows in other genres can sometimes count as \\"tokusatsu\\" as well. The most popular types of \\"tokusatsu\\" include \\"kaiju\\" monster movies like the \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Gamera\\" film series; superhero TV serials such as the \\"Kamen Rider\\" and \\"Metal Hero\\"; and mecha series like \\"Giant Robo\\". Some \\"tokusatsu\\" television programs combine several of these subgenres, for example the \\"Ultraman\\" and \\"Super Sentai\\" series.\\n\\n- A submarine is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability. The term most commonly refers to a large, crewed vessel. It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the midget submarine and the wet sub. Used as an adjective in phrases such as \\"submarine cable\\", \\"submarine\\" means \\"under the sea\\". The noun \\"submarine\\" evolved as a shortened form of \\"submarine boat\\" (and is often further shortened to \\"sub\\").

They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.\\n\\n- In the United States, Gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of UHF television stations featuring Saturday afternoon matinee showcases like \\"Creature Double Feature\\" and later in the 1990s when several \\"Gamera\\" films were featured on the TV show \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\".\\n\\n- Plot.\\nTen years after the destruction of Jamahl, Earth has returned to peace again.

This threat is realized when a Cosmo Academia exploration submarine comes across a fissure in the ocean floor, out of which rises a huge flying fortress of the ancient tribe Melzard. This clan has been resting for millennia and seeks to destroy mankind. Matriarch Mother Melzard sends her oldest sons Raija and Dezzle to lead the attack with Raija's Elebamamoth. By then, Guru has infused the Neo Insect Armor with Insect Power, creating the three Command Voicers to link three humans with the armor. Kengo Tachibana and Ran Ayukawa, who have been selected to wear the new armor, ready themselves and become B-Fighter Kuwagar and B-Fighter Tentou.

Kengo and Ran are shocked that this high school student is to be B-Fighter Kabuto, but they go to him and teach him how to transform. He changes into Kabuto and the three of them attack Elebammoth and several henchmen, with Kabuto killing Elebammoth. Refusing to accept defeat, Mother Melzard continues her attacks, with Raija and Dezzle working against each other in their attacks on the B-Fighters.\\n\\n- M.E.Ch.A.

They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said.\\nPresident Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements.\\nPompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements.\\nThe secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.\\nAfter the summit,...\\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\\nQuestion: When will the US take back some of the sanctions on North Korea?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. not enough information\\n\\nB. after they completely denuclearize\\n\\nC. before they denuclearize\\n\\nD. after they improve relations with the US by complying with denuclearization stages","target":"D","rationale":"The article mentions that the US will not give any concessions to North Korea until complete denuclearization has taken place.

James Brown began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first professional recording, \\"Please, Please, Please\\", in 1956. On hit songs such as \\"Try Me\\", \\"Bewildered\\", \\"Think\\", \\"I Don't Mind\\", and \\"I'll Go Crazy\\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned delivery, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, they performed on 12 songs that reached the Billboard R&B and pop charts, in addition to being featured on numerous albums, including the groundbreaking Live at the Apollo.\\n\\nIn 1986, the first committee of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame announced that James Brown would be one of the Hall of Fame's first charter members to be inducted. However, Brown's former singing group, the Famous Flames, were not included in this induction. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's criterion states that only artists whose first recording had been out for more than 25 years were eligible for induction. Brown's first solo recording did not meet that criterion. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame president and chief executive officer Terry Stewart contended that Brown was indeed eligible for induction but as a member of The Famous Flames. Concerning the Hall of Fame's failure to induct The Flames with Brown back in 1986, Stewart went on to say: \\"There was no legislative intent why they weren't included; somehow they just got overlooked.\\"  In 2011, a special committee was set up to correct exclusions which might have occurred during the first two years of Rock Hall inductions (1986 and 1987) due to the impact of the bands' lead singers or front men. The Famous Flames (Byrd, Bennett, Terry and Stallworth) were inducted in April 2012 alongside other \\"backing groups\\" such as The Midnighters (Hank Ballard), The Comets (Bill Haley), The Crickets (Buddy Holly), The Blue Caps (Gene Vincent) and The Miracles (Smokey Robinson). Since all these lead singers were actually members of these groups, these were not really \\"backing groups\\" at all. This was highlighted by Smokey Robinson, who did the induction honors for all of the groups, including his own Miracles, who stated, \\"These people do not stand behind you. They stand with you.\\" \\"These are not backing groups. These are the groups.\\" Bennett, as the Famous Flames' only surviving member, accepted the honor in person in Cleveland on April 14, 2012. Bennett further stated the induction was not only a correction for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame committee's mishap in 1986 but also a reunion: \\"For years, I felt like we were all separated,\\" said Bennett. \\"I feel like we're whole again, I wish we could all be here as one group. Yes, James Brown was the most famous of the Flames, but we were all Famous Flames.\\"  Onstage, during the induction ceremony, Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, said, \\"If James Brown was the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, The Famous Flames were the hardest-working group\\".  The Famous Flames did appear in the James Brown biopic Get on Up, which was released in U.S. theatres nationwide on August 1, 2014.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all.
