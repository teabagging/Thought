It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1â13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23â31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"...., can you guess it ?","target":"Acts of the Apostles","rationale":"...

POST : I (18M) asked my father if I could take my vyvanse late (5pm) today to finish some schoolwork I have to do.

He knew this from days ago, and let me take the medication even after I clarified the intention of me staying in was because my friend planned on coming over. As soon as I go back to my room my friend texts me saying there is a possibility of having to cancel our plans. I figured I didn't want to stay home all night idly (because the work I have to finish can be done relatively quickly if I apply myself to it, which I plan to do). I went back to his room and asked if I could end up going out IF my friend did not come over. I barely managed to finish the sentence before he began hollering at me about being ridiculous for not keeping an agreement for more than 10 minutes. I asked him, extremely calmly, to not yell at me for asking for this on basis that I had agreed to not go out because I expected my plans to go through, however felt it'd be fair to establish a backup plan given the uncertainty. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was annoyed by his reaction because of the excessive yelling because my family is currently undergoing a therapy process which mainly revolves around being kinder to each other (my family's extremely dysfunctional/aggressive, especially when disagreeing with each other, and everybody basically reached their limits, so we collectively decided to seek out professional help) and that went completely out the window without much build-up or an extensive argument (as is common). I understand that he is in the right to be annoyed over me suddenly contradicting the terms I had agreed to in order to take the medication. I also understand that given my history of drug use (which he was fine with) and currently undergoing treatment for Bipolar Disorder II he is right to be concerned about me taking amphetamine-based medicine and going out, therefore implying taking other substances such as alcohol, which he is not opposed to but prohibited me from engaging in recreational drug use (admittedly I never was the most obedient teenager, so it's sensible for him to be suspicious).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n I truly had no intention of drinking, smoking or taking anything because I did drink some beers yesterday and am feeling quite exhausted, but simply wanted to meet up with my friends and meet new people tonight, but that's not something he'd believe in.

It is a branch of the Na-Dene language family. Extensive effort is being put into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and culture. Missionaries of the Russian Orthodox Church were the first to develop a written version of Tlingit, using the Cyrillic script to record and translate it, when the Russian Empire had contact with Alaska and the coast of North America down to Sonoma County, California.\\n\\nTlingit has eight vowels, four vowels further distinguished formally by length. However, the length distinction is often in terms of tenseness rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low tone; in the orthography high tone is indicated by an acute accent, e.g. aa, and low tone is unmarked, e.g. aa. The Southern and Transitional dialects have a mid tone which is unmarked and additional low tone which is marked by a grave accent, e.g. aa.  As noted in the vowel chart above, there is an allophone of /a:/ (orthographic aa) which is realized as [a:] under the influence of uvular consonants, however this is not consistent for all speakers. The backness influence arises from articulation with uvular consonants, thus the word khaa \\"person\\" is often spoken as [qha:], whereas the word (a) kaa \\"on (its) surface\\" is said as [(?^) kha:] by the same speakers.  Word onset is always consonantal in Tlingit, i.e. no word may begin with a vowel. Where one would occur theoretically by e.g. prefixing or compounding, the vowel is obligatorily preceded by either [?] or [j]. The former is universal in single words, and the latter is found varying with [?] in word-medial position in compounds. The orthography does not reflect the [?] in word-initial position, but either . or y may be seen in medial position. For example, the word khoowat'aa \\"the weather is hot\\" (khu-yu-ya-t'aa, INDH.OBJ-PERF-(0, -D, +I)-hot) is phonetically [qhu:w^t'a:], but when the perfective prefix yu- is word initial in uwat'aa \\"it is hot\\" (0-yu-ya-t'aa, 3NEU.OBJ-PERF-(0, -D, +I)-hot) the phonetic form is [?Uw^t'a:] where the glottal stop appears to ensure that the word begins with a consonant.

This distinction appears in Phenomenology of Perception (p. 207, 2nd note [Fr. ed.]) and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language (le langage parle et le langage parlant) (The Prose of the World, p. 10). Spoken language (le langage parle), or secondary expression, returns to our linguistic baggage, to the cultural heritage that we have acquired, as well as the brute mass of relationships between signs and significations. Speaking language (le langage parlant), or primary expression, such as it is, is language in the production of a sense, language at the advent of a thought, at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense.  It is speaking language, that is to say, primary expression, that interests Merleau-Ponty and which keeps his attention through his treatment of the nature of production and the reception of expressions, a subject which also overlaps with an analysis of action, of intentionality, of perception, as well as the links between freedom and external conditions.  The notion of style occupies an important place in \\"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence\\". In spite of certain similarities with Andre Malraux, Merleau-Ponty distinguishes himself from Malraux in respect to three conceptions of style, the last of which is employed in Malraux's The Voices of Silence. Merleau-Ponty remarks that in this work \\"style\\" is sometimes used by Malraux in a highly subjective sense, understood as a projection of the artist's individuality. Sometimes it is used, on the contrary, in a very metaphysical sense (in Merleau-Ponty's opinion, a mystical sense), in which style is connected with a conception of an \\"uber-artist\\" expressing \\"the Spirit of Painting\\". Finally, it sometimes is reduced to simply designating a categorization of an artistic school or movement. (However, this account of Malraux's notion of style--a key element in his thinking--is open to serious question.)  For Merleau-Ponty, it is these uses of the notion of style that lead Malraux to postulate a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty, it is important to consider the heart of this problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. (However, Merleau-Ponty's reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux's theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux.) For Merleau-Ponty, style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"Is his art usually based on language and speaking?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"\\"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence","rationale":"From the given context, it is clear that speaking language (le langage parlant) and primary expression are used synonymously by Merleau-Ponty.\\nMerleau-Ponty's philosophy of speech also includes an analysis of production and reception of expressions which overlaps with action, intentionality, perception as well as freedom and external conditions. \\nHe distinguishes between spoken language (or secondary expression), which returns to our linguistic baggage from cultural heritage that we have acquired or mass relationships between signs and significations; speaking language (or primary expression) such as it is expressed in the advent of thought where sense manifests itself for its own sake.  \\nThe famous style concept occupies a prominent place in \\"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence\\" wherein Malraux"},{"source":"In this task, you are given two simple actions (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\").

However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F.

This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic.

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food.

Cardiac output and regional blood flow were measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in rats with portal hypertension caused by portal vein stenosis, in rats with end-to-side portacaval shunts, and in sham-operated rats. Cardiac output was significantly higher in rats with surgical shunts than in those of the two other groups and was significantly lower in sham-operated rats compared with portal hypertensive rats.

These blood flows were also significantly higher in portal hypertensive rats than in sham-operated animals. A significant correlation was found between cardiac output and portal tributary blood flow in rats with portal vein stenosis and in rats with surgical shunts; this correlation was absent in sham-operated rats.

A member of this family is also called a felid.\\n\\n- The Old World consists of Africa, Europe, and Asia, regarded collectively as the part of the world known to Europeans before contact with the Americas. It is used in the context of, and contrast with, the New World (Americas).\\n\\n- Puma is a genus in Felidae that contains the cougar ( also known as the puma , among other names ) and the jaguarundi , and may also include several poorly known Old World fossil representatives ( for example , Puma pardoides , or \`\` Owen 's panther , '' a large cougar - like cat of Eurasia 's Pliocene ) .\\n\\n- The jaguar (\\"Panthera onca\\") is a big cat, a feline in the \\"Panthera\\" genus, and is the only extant \\"Panthera\\" species native to the Americas. The jaguar is the third-largest feline after the tiger and the lion, and the largest in the Americas. The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina. Apart from a known and possibly breeding population in Arizona (southeast of Tucson) and the bootheel of New Mexico, the cat has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century.\\n\\n- The cougar (\\"Puma concolor\\"), also commonly known as the mountain lion, puma, panther, or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the greatest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the second-heaviest cat in the New World, after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although there are daytime sightings. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas.\\n\\n- The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.\\n\\n- Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million kmÂ² (11.7 million squareÂ miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.\\n\\n- The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18Â° south and 20Â° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.\\n\\n- The Felinae are a subfamily of the family Felidae, which includes the genera and species listed below. Most are small to medium-sized cats, although the group does include some larger animals, such as the cougar and cheetah. The earliest records of the Felinae are ascribed to \\"Felis attica\\" from the late Miocene, 9 million years ago (Mya), of western Eurasia.\\n\\n- The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch.\\n\\n- A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.\\n\\n- Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset.\\n\\n- Pantherinae is a subfamily within the cat family Felidae named and first described by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1917.\\n\\n- Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.\\n\\n- The world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization. In a philosophical context, the world is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world. In a theological context, the \\"world\\" is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred. The \\"end of the world\\" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in religious contexts.\\n\\n- The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'puma ' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'.

The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist.

POST : I met my girlfriend Daisy four months ago on a dating app. Over time I realized Daisy was extremely reticent about pretty much every facet of her life. Example: I asked her how many siblings she had and she told me she had two siblings, then immediately started peppering me with questions about my siblings. That's what she does. She deflects and redirects people like that and if you're not careful, you won't realize what just happened. I used to think, \\"wow, she's really interested in me!\\" But really, it's a smokescreen. When I started to realize I literally knew nothing about her, basic things like what she did for work, her family situation, essentially her whole life history up until we met. I could tell you her favorite books and  TV shows but not much else.\\n\\nI raised my concerns with her and she basically told me that she doesn't like to talk about that stuff, she moved here to not think about any of it, it was really painful for her to talk about. I was kind of hurt that she didn't trust me enough, or was comfortable enough with me to be open and honest. I told her this. She got pretty offended and told me I, nor anyone else, was entitled to know the personal details of her life as they aren't relevant and I'm over stepping my boundaries. I backed off. I had clearly upset her and I needed to think about what she said and get a second opinion. \\n\\nI talked to my buddies about it, or tried to. They joked that she's a Russian spy. They didn't seem to think it was that big of a deal. They've met Daisy and think highly of her. She's witty, smart as hell, kind^andsmokinhot, just an all around fantastic girl in every way. We have similar beliefs, interests, hobbies, the same sense of humor. \\n\\nI'm very much tempted to let it go, but I also think it's not weird that someone would want to know basic information about someone they're dating.

Passage 1:In 1938, after graduating from the Spetses school, Xenakis moved to Athens to prepare for entrance exams at the National Technical University of Athens. Although he intended to study architecture and engineering, he also took lessons in harmony and counterpoint with Aristotelis Koundouroff. In 1940 he successfully passed the exams, but his studies were cut short by the Greco-Italian War, which began with the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940. Although Greece eventually won the war, it was not long before the German army joined the Italians in the Battle of Greece, in April 1941. This led to the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II, which lasted until late 1944, when the Allies began their drive across Europe, forcing the Axis forces to withdraw. Xenakis joined the National Liberation Front early during the war, participating in mass protests and demonstrations, and later becoming part of armed resistanceâthis last step was a painful experience Xenakis refused to discuss until much later in life. After the Axis forces left, Churchill ordered that British forces step in to help restore the Greek monarchy; they were opposed by the Democratic Army of Greece, and the country plunged into a civil war. In December 1944, during the period of Churchill's martial law, Xenakis (who was by then a member of the communist students' company of the left-wing Lord Byron faction of ELAS) became involved in street fighting against British tanks. He was wounded and facially disfigured when shrapnel from a tank blast hit his cheek and left eye, which was blinded; that Xenakis survived the injury has been described as a miracle.\\n Passage 2:He was born to Sir Christopher Ingold and Dr. Hilda Usherwood, and studied for a BSc in Chemistry at the University of London, completing his degree in 1949.

Soon after graduation he moved to Canada to begin work with the National Research Council, followed by two years of post-doctoral research at the University of British Columbia. He returned to work for the NRC in 1955 as a research officer, followed by a promotion to head of the Free Radical Chemistry Section. He was awarded the 1968 Petroleum Chemistry Award, the 1988 Linus Pauling Award, and both the Davy Medal and Royal Medal of the Royal Society, the latter for \\"elucidating the mechanism of reactions involving free radicals\\". In 1995 he was made an officer of the Order of Canada.

Cranston was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church, and performed weddings for $150 a service to help with his income. He also worked as a waiter, night-shift security guard at the gates of a private LA community, truck loader, camera operator for a video dating service, and CCTV security guard at a supermarket. He started working regularly in the late 1980s, mostly doing minor roles and advertisements. He was an original cast member of the ABC soap opera Loving, where he played Douglas Donovan from 1983 to 1985. Cranston starred in the short-lived series Raising Miranda in 1988.

In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole.  Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86Â°13.6â²N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean.\\nThe idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.\\nNansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work.

G2 recognizes a conserved epitope on the MERS-CoV S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and neutralizes MERS-CoV by interfering with binding to host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4). The findings are relevant for understanding the viral attachment mechanism and for the development of S1-NTD-based vaccines. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged into the human population in 2012 and has caused substantial morbidity and mortality. Potently neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein have been characterized, but much less is known about antibodies targeting non-RBD epitopes. Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of G2, a neutralizing antibody targeting the MERS-CoV S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD). Structures of G2 alone and in complex with the MERS-CoV S1-NTD define a site of vulnerability comprising two loops, each of which contain a residue mutated in G2-escape variants. Cell-surface binding studies and in vitro competition experiments demonstrate that G2 strongly disrupts the attachment of MERS-CoV S to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), with the inhibition requiring the native trimeric S conformation. These results advance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of coronaviruses and should facilitate the development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV. \\n Title: The Author(s)","target":"False","rationale":"The title \\"The Author(s)\\" is the list of authors listed on the first page of the paper.

While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.\\nLater, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand.

Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.","target":"Olivia","rationale":"The first paragraph of the article describes Sam's premonition that the bridge will collapse, and his ability to convince many people to leave. This includes Candice Hooper, Peter Friedkinâs girlfriend, who would have died on the bridge if she had not left when she did. The second paragraph details Olivia Castle falling out a window onto a car after being trapped in an eye-surgery clinic while undergoing laser treatment for myopia. Therefore we can infer that her accident was caused by malfunctioning equipment at the surgery clinic which led her fall from height; this is also confirmed as it states that \\"she trips and falls out of the window\\".\\nSo based on context clues provided within our passage excerpted from Wikipedia - Final Destination 5 , Olivia is indeed our best answer ."},{"source":"In this task, you are given the name of an Indian food dish.

Despite his NCAA football success, Ward was one of the very few players who won a Heisman trophy but was not drafted in the NFL draft. He won the College Football National Championship Game with the Florida State University Seminoles. Ward played several years with the New York Knicks and started in the NBA Finals.\\nContext: Ward won the 1993 Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and Davey O'Brien Award as a quarterback for Florida State University, and subsequently led the Seminoles to their first-ever National Championship when FSU defeated Nebraska 18-16 in the 1993 Orange Bowl. The Seminoles had suffered their only defeat of the season to a second-ranked Notre Dame team, but their path to the National Championship was cleared a week later when the Irish were upset at home by Boston College. Ward holds the third-largest margin of victory in the history of Heisman trophy balloting, with a 1,622-point difference, third only to O.J. Simpson's 1,750-point win in 1968 and Troy Smith's 1,662-point win in 2006. He was also the only Heisman winner to play in the NBA. In 1993, Charlie Ward won the James E. Sullivan Award from the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) as the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States.  Though Ward did not play baseball in college, he was drafted as a pitcher by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 59th round of the 1993 free agent draft and in the 18th round by the New York Yankees in 1994. An avid tennis player, Ward also shone in the Arthur Ashe Amateur Tennis Tournament in 1994.  Ward was a model student-athlete at Florida State. As a senior and captain of the team in 1993, he voluntarily approached Seminoles head coach Bobby Bowden about a difficult situation surrounding incoming freshman Warrick Dunn, whose mother, policewoman Betty Smothers, was killed in the line of duty during Dunn's senior year of high school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Charlie served as a surrogate big brother to Dunn during the latter's first year in Tallahassee, helping him through a trying time by becoming his roommate and friend. With Ward's help on and off the field, Dunn eventually became one of the better running backs in the country and a first-round NFL draft pick.  Ward also played basketball for four years at Florida State University (FSU). Former teammates included future NBA players Bob Sura, Doug Edwards, and Sam Cassell. His 1993 team made it to the Southeast Regional Final where they lost to Kentucky 106-81 with the winner advancing to the Final Four. Ward's 1992 team made the Sweet Sixteen. He made the game-winning shot in its Metro Conference Tournament Championship game win over Louisville in 1991. Ward still holds FSU basketball records for career steals at 236, steals in one game at 9 and still ranks sixth all-time in assists at 396. He played a shortened season his senior year, joining the basketball team just 15 days after winning the Heisman Trophy. He started 16 games at the point guard position that year, and averaged a college career high of 10.5 points and 4.9 assists for the season.  In his senior year at Florida State, he also served as Student Government Vice-President, after he was asked to run by the Monarchy Party, a student government reform organization.\\nQuestion: What sport did he play?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"first-ever National Championship when FSU defeated Nebraska 18-16 in the 1993 Orange Bowl.","rationale":"The context states that Ward won the College Football National Championship Game with Florida State University.

The band currently consists of Luke Pritchard (vocals/rhythm guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar/synth), Alexis Nunez (drums), and Peter Denton (bass guitar). The original bassist was Max Rafferty, and the founding drummer was Paul Garred. The lineup of the band remained constant until the departure of Rafferty in 2008.\\n\\nAfter they had signed to Virgin Records, the Kooks were reluctant to record an album straight away, stating a desire to focus more on their live performances and songwriting. The band has said embarking on their first live tour instead of recording an album initially helped them develop their style and sound. As Pritchard claimed, \\"We didn't sit down with a blueprint. We just naturally developed and we didn't try to shape or mould ourselves to anything.\\" As a result, they went into the studio with hundreds of songs from a variety of genres, and it took an \\"incredible amount of patience\\" from producer Tony Hoffer to shape the content into what would become the record.  Following their first tour supporting the Thrills, the Kooks recorded their debut album, Inside In/Inside Out, at Konk studios in London in 2005. Though media attention was dominated by the release of the Arctic Monkeys debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not on the same day, Inside In/Inside Out recorded first week sales of 19,098. Later, speaking to NME, Pritchard would thank the Arctic Monkeys for \\"shielding\\" The Kooks from the press' scrutiny. \\"God bless the Arctic Monkeys because if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have been so shielded. We were so overshadowed by the success [of Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not] because it was so monster and we crept in behind everybody's back.\\" Entering the UK Albums Chart at number nine, it would eventually peak at number 2 for two weeks. Singles \\"Eddie's Gun\\", \\"Sofa Song\\", \\"You Don't Love Me\\", \\"Naive\\", \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\" and \\"Ooh La\\" achieved chart success in the UK and Europe, while \\"Naive\\" and \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\" put The Kooks in the top ten for the first time.  Kev Kharas, in his review for Drowned in Sound, viewed the Kooks as \\"a less irreverent and more melodic Art Brut, swapping that band's caustic wit for a far nicer type of honesty.\\" Kharas also noted traces of \\"emo\\" in the band's style. AllMusic's Tim Sendra noted that the band's direction was \\"heavily indebted to classic rock\\", in particular Thin Lizzy and the Dexys, ultimately though Sendra felt \\"the band sounds like the Kooks and no one else\\". Calling the Kooks \\"an important reminder that there are just as many mediocre bands in the UK as there are in the United States\\" reviewer Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone claimed the album was \\"utterly forgettable, shoddily produced retro rock that at its worst sounds like a Brighton-accented version of the Spin Doctors\\". Brian Belardi of Prefix gave a positive review, describing Inside In/Inside Out as \\"An almost-perfect blend of '60s-style Britpop, '90s-style Britpop, and the post-punk of the new millennium\\".  The album went on to be certified quadruple platinum in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) within a year and certified platinum across Europe by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The success of their debut album brought the band into mainstream media attention, winning the award for best UK and Ireland act at the MTV Awards in 2006 and picking up a Brit Awards nomination for \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\", in 2007.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"The Kooks","rationale":"The given text is about the band The Kooks.\\nThis can be inferred from reading the first sentence: \\"The Kooks are an English pop rock band formed in 2004 in Brighton.\\""},{"source":"Falsely accused: Sunil Tripathi, 22, was wrongly fingered as the Boston marathon bomber on Reddit A Rhode Island family is anxiously awaiting news from authorities on whether the body they pulled from Providence River on Tuesday evening is their son, missing Brown student Sunil Tripathi.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.\\n\\nand the situation: Two earth-like planets orbited the same star.

Steamships usually use the prefix designations of \\"PS\\" for \\"paddle steamer\\" or \\"SS\\" for \\"screw steamer\\" (using a propeller or screw). As paddle steamers became less common, \\"SS\\" is assumed by many to stand for \\"steam ship\\".

The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\".

Methods In this prospective genomic study, we took nasal samples from camels imported from Sudan and Djibouti into the Port of Jeddah in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over an almost 2-year period and local Arabian camels over 2 months in the year after surveillance of the port. We determined the prevalence of MERS-CoV infection, age-associated patterns of infection, and undertook phylogeographical and migration analyses to determine intercountry virus transmission after local lineage establishment. We compared all virological characteristics between the local and imported cohorts. We compared major gene deletions between African and Arabian strains of the virus. Reproductive numbers were inferred with Bayesian birth death skyline analyses. Between Aug 10, 2016, and May 3, 2018, we collected samples from 1196 imported camels, of which 868 originated from Sudan and 328 from Djibouti, and between May 1, and June 25, 2018, we collected samples from 472 local camels, of which 189 were from Riyadh and 283 were from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Virus prevalence was higher in local camels than in imported camels (224 [47Â·5%] of 472 vs 157 [13Â·1%] of 1196; p<0Â·0001). Infection prevalence peaked among camels older than 1 year and aged up to 2 years in both groups, with 255 (66Â·9%) of 381 positive cases in this age group. Although the overall geographical distribution of the virus corresponded with the phylogenetic tree topology, some virus exchange was observed between countries corresponding with trade routes in the region. East and west African strains of the virus appear to be geographically separated, with an origin of west African strains in east Africa. African strains of the virus were not re-sampled in Saudi Arabia despite sampling approximately 1 year after importation from Africa. All local Arabian samples contained strains of the virus that belong to a novel recombinant clade (NRC) first detected in 2014 in Saudi Arabia. Reproduction number estimates informed by the sequences suggest sustained endemicity of NRC, with a mean R e of 1Â·16. Interpretation Despite frequent imports of MERS-CoV with camels from Africa, African lineages of MERS-CoV do not establish themselves in Saudi Arabia. Arabian strains of the virus should be tested for changes in virulence and transmissibility.","target":"Enzootic patterns of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in imported African and local Arabian dromedary camels: a prospective genomic study","rationale":"The title should provide an overview of the main results and findings of this study, including the patterns of MERS-CoV infection in imported African and local Arabian camels, as well as genetic analysis and estimates of virus reproduction numbers.

POST : This is a long one, tl;dr will be provided.\\n\\nThis actually happened last year, but it has been gnawing at me for some time and I figured posting here might help me put the issue to rest. For context, this occurred at the very beginning of the summer after I graduated high school in June. I had been dating my girlfriend at the time for about 4 months, the first 3 of which were wonderful. However, things started to take a turn for the worse towards the final days of the school year. My Ex has moderate to severe BPD, and this began to cause problems toward the end of the relationship. She told me about it relatively early on, and I made sure to be as supportive as possible. Since Iâve been told by friends that Iâm a good listener and someone to count (at least Iâd like to think so) I let her know that she could talk to me about anything if she felt the need. Although she was rather closed off at first, she rather quickly began to âventâ to me on a regular basis. These instances became more and more frequent and progressively got darker as time went on, and I honestly became less sympathetic. She would put down her friends and others close to her for what I would consider mild inconveniences, often exclaiming that âThey know what theyâre doing, if they donât support me or ask me how Iâm feeling if I look upset than how are they real friends?â Iâm very much a person that likes to cut people slack. A few minutes late? No problem. Didnât talk to me for very long at a party? All good, lots of people you need to attend to. But it seemed to me that she took these kinds of things as an affront, as if there were a setlist of requirements to being in her personal circle. Not only did this attitude seem to alienate her friends, but it also started to alienate me. \\n\\nBy the last two weeks, I was rather drained and honestly waiting for a good time to have a serious conversation about our relationship. Everything culminated the night before we broke up. We were at her best friends graduation party with a shitload of mutual friends. I drove her there and spent the majority of the first few hours with her and some of the other couples. After some time and a few beers, I began to wander around and talk to people who went to our school who I had never gotten around to meeting before. Honestly, I was having a blast, and assumed she was with her friends feeling the same. When I returned about 30 min later she was gone, so I went to look for her and found her alone in a quiet portion of the house. She was rather distraught and didnât tell me why, despite my asking. I quickly became fed up and told her I was going back to the party and she could join me if she wanted to which she declined. After drinking much more as the night went on, I caught back up with her when it was time for bed. In the middle of the night I drunkenly woke up to her hysterically crying next to me. When I asked what was wrong she said she knew I didnât love her and that I was considering how she felt at all. I was kind of taken aback at first, but so drunk that I just told her we should talk about it in the morning. The next day I told her rather frankly that I thought she was an unessecarily negative person and that, as hard a burden as it is, mental illness is no excuse to treat people the way she had been.\\nI told her that she wasnât being rational and she should seriously consider seeing a therapist about these emotions and that it could be seriously beneficial to he mental health. After some heated arguing I told her that it would be best to break up under the current circumstances and so we did. Last I heard she continues to maintain that Iâm an emotionless rock who couldnât understand her point of view, and sometimes I find myself believing her. Maybe I could have handled it better?  Let me have it.\\n\\n\\nTl;dr Ex has serious emotional problems and negative habits that made me break up with her, she has said that I just couldnât see her side and wasnât supportive enough and too âcold and objectiveâ","target":"no","rationale":"The post is a detailed account of the author's relationship with their ex-girlfriend.

It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the CretaceousâPaleogene boundary (KâPg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.\\nThe crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10â30 km (6.2â18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the YucatÃ¡n during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.\\nIn 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself.

If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans.\\nWith the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches.\\nOn Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\".

The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes.","target":"Adult","rationale":"The abstract describes a study of 114 patients with diabetes mellitus.

There was a significant difference in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels between psychiatrically ill patients (mean = 10.8%) and those who were never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). Patients with recent psychiatric illnesses also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control than did patients without a history of emotional distress (p < .0001).

On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer.\\nIn a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice.

He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the OpÃ©ra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opÃ©ra comique, La grand'tante,  presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his protÃ©gÃ©'s reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870â71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opÃ©ra comique in four acts, Don CÃ©sar de Bazan (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy  Les Ãrinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine, both of which were performed at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de l'OdÃ©on.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prebiotic supplementation with stabilized rice bran (SRB) in milk on health, immunity, and performance of pre-weaned organic dairy calves. Holstein heifer calves (n = 90) were enrolled at 6 Â± 1 days old and monitored for 28 days, from July to August 2017. Calves were randomly assigned to a control (CTR; n = 45) or a treatment group (SRB; n = 45). The CTR group received milk alone and the SRB group received 120 g of SRB per day in milk to achieve a 10% w/w dose of the total calories. Daily health evaluations were conducted to score health status and disease severity (healthy, slightly affected, moderately or severely sick) of calves, through integrated assessment of diarrhea, dehydration, attitude, and milk intake. Body weights and fecal IgA quantification were completed on the first and last day of the study. Results: Overall, weight gain and fecal IgA concentrations were not affected by the dietary addition of SRB. The total number of calf-days classified as healthy or sick were not different between treatment groups. Similarly, the number of calf-days categorized as slightly affected, moderately sick, or severely sick did not differ between treatment groups. Time to event analyses indicated a tendency for a treatment effect in the time to the first moderate case of diarrhea (P = 0.08), as well as in the time to recovery from diarrhea (P = 0.052), favoring control calves. Conclusions: These results indicated that the dietary addition of SRB in milk did not have an effect in health, immunity or performance of pre-weaned dairy calves.","target":"Effect of prebiotic supplementation with stabilized rice bran in milk of pre-weaned organic Holstein calves","rationale":"The title should provide evidence that the dietary addition of SRB in milk did not have an effect on health, immunity, or performance of pre-weaned dairy calves.

I work as a software developer (kind of, see later), just graduated from university. Over summer last year, I worked for a small company (about 8 developers and 2 bosses/managers) doing a programming internship for three months, completely unpaid, even paying for my own transport costs. After graduating they offered me a temporary job for three months to do a short amount of work, with the possibility for extension, which I took. Importantly, my brother works there full time, which is how I got into the company. (would not recommended, not because I don't get on with *him*, as I do, but because it's hard not to worry any tension between me and other people (which I'm great at generating) won't somehow affect him)\\n\\nI have got on really well with everyone there, including the bosses, Mary and Mark. While Mary and Mark act as management and team leaders, they also do marketing, client relations, presentations etc. Basically everything the company needs that isn't programming.\\n\\nI really like everyone as people. But as coworkers, they're complete nightmares and do not get along at all. Two employee are always making snide remarks at each other under a very weak facade of \\"I'm just joking!\\" causing a lot of tension. Another employee is constantly late, delays meetings, argues with Mark and talks down to people he is supposed to be teaching. Circular arguments getting increasingly louder with immovable egos are incredibly common. Code is always written \\"my way\\" with no consistency. The bosses seem perfectly fine with all behaviour, with attempt to reprimand anyone. The way Mary handled my contract broke the law in minor ways at multiple points. Essentially, Mary and Mark seem pretty incompetent at management. It's worth mentioning the entire office is in one room so everyone can hear every conversation. Ultimately, we mutually didn't extend my contract because I did not want to work in that kind of environment. \\n\\nWhen I started I was given a pretty old laptop with a fairly damaged screen, but otherwise it did work fine. Ok, I thought, I'll just mainly use a monitor (everyone at the company has a laptop and one monitor, some people have two monitors). \\n\\nI asked Mary if there were any monitors I could use. She directed me to two old monitors, with a vga to vga cable, when my laptop only takes HDMI. I ask people if there are any vga to HDMI adapters, and they essentially say \\"there might be some around\\". The office is a complete mess with no organisation (of course), so I give up after a few minutes and buy one online. \\n\\nThe cable arrives, and the monitors don't work. I tell Mary \\"I don't think these monitors work with this laptop\\" and she agrees the monitors are kind of crappy. I take the cable home and test on my own computer, and they do work, and my work laptop does work with my brother's monitors, meaning the fault is with the old monitors. I tell Mary \\"these monitors don't work\\". I don't remember the response, but I suppose I assumed I had implied I would like a monitor.\\n\\nA week later, I mention to everyone during a team meeting, including Mary and Mark, that my monitors don't work. Nothing still happens so I think \\"fine, I'm just a temp. Maybe their budget doesn't extend that far\\" and left it, except sometimes jokingly mentioning to the others how nice it must be to have two monitors. I also mention in private to my brother how hard it is it work with no monitor, but I thought the issue was closed.\\n\\nIn their defence, I don't think I ever actually directly asked for them to buy me a new monitor, but it didn't really seem appropriate as a new employee and I wasn't really sure whether the employees bought and owned the monitors they used or if the company did (as it turned out, the company did), or what the standard procedure for well, anything was, bearing in mind this was my first professional job and I didn't want to overstep any boundaries. I also didn't have any kind of \\"this is how things work here now\\" as I had gone from an intern to an employee, and it had been a year.\\n\\nI work for two months and the job I was supposed to be doing falls through and I get moved onto doing testing instead of programming, which is *not* what I agreed to, although it does say in my contract they can make me do whatever they think is appropriate. I do not like testing and am not good at it. The little bit of programming I'm expected to do is in a language I don't like and is back-end, when the original work was basically the exact opposite of these two things. I'm unable to do it and my brother has to take it from me, making me feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed. I do nothing and learn nothing for two months, making me already incredibly bitter and feel like I'm utterly wasting my time.\\n\\nDuring this time there were a few other things that made me feel undervalued and completely unwanted there. Not unwanted personally, but professionally. However, I know I can be a little paranoid, so I ignore it I put down the way I've been treated to incompetence rather than intent. It'll be over soon anyway.\\n\\nTwo months are past and I have two weeks left. A new guy, Bob, starts working there temporarily for a few months just like me, same age as me too, although he's there to help with the management side of things rather than \\"programming\\". Mark is away on business and has been for a week or so, so Mary invites Bob to sit at Mark's desk and use his monitors until he gets back. I'm a little annoyed I hadn't been asked to sit there while Mark was away but whatever, I hadn't thought of it either.\\n\\nA few days after Bob starts, Mary walks in carrying a brand new monitor in a box. Somehow, I already know what she's going to say. \\n\\n\\"Bob's new monitor has arrived!\\"\\n\\nApparently there wasn't a budget, there was just complete apathy. I'm absolutely livid. The angriest I have probably been in years. I want to fucking scream at someone, though I'm not sure what or who at. \\"But *I* wanted a monitor!\\" probably wouldn't achieve much. It's ridiculous over a fucking *monitor*, but I'm shaking with anger. It's embarrassing. Fortunately, I sit in the corner (worst spot in the office, obviously) and have my headphones in so I sit there for a bit until the conversation dies down and everyone is at their desk. I then go outside and calm down until I stop shaking. I sit back down and try to pretend everything is ok, which really, it should be, but my voice is still shaky and I'm so angry  I can't concentrate on my work for the rest of the day.\\n\\nNow, as Bob is brand new and was already using a monitor, I doubt he asked for a monitor, Mary would have bought him one.\\n\\nSomehow the conversation gets back onto monitors and I say something like \\"As Bob has a new monitor, could I have a monitor please?\\"\\n\\nMy brother responds with \\"oh, did you actually want a monitor?\\". \\n\\nAlthough it's not his responsibility to buy equipment for me, it's Mary's, this still pisses me off. I say as calmly as possible while still an irritated voice \\"*Of course* I want a monitor. I mentioned *multiple times* that the monitors you gave me don't work\\". \\n\\n\\"Oh, I didn't know that\\". Which is a blatant lie. I'm not sure how much clearer I could be than \\"these monitors don't work\\".\\n\\nMy brother gave me one of his monitors that works, but it's all a bit bittersweet. Mary still hasn't bought me a monitor.\\n\\n\\nJust to clarify, I'm not angry about Bob getting a monitor and me not, not really. I'm angry that Mary decided that Bob would get something she should have known I needed to be efficient. Someone that did not spend three months doing completely free work and someone that did not spend two weeks trying to politely prompt her. How else am I meant to feel but unwanted in that workplace?\\n\\nI'm angry at the complete apathy I feel is directed towards me, for no apparent reason. I'm angry that I'm treated like an intern not an employee. The monitor was just the final straw. If I wasn't leaving already, I would think about quitting asap.\\n\\nSo I don't think I'm an asshole for being annoyed about the monitor thing, but am I the asshole for being being entitled? Am I the asshole for being as angry as I am over something trivial? Am I the asshole for not trying hard enough to communicate and then getting angry?","target":"no","rationale":"The author describes a past event in which they worked at a company as an intern and then as an employee.

The Hebrew language is the only living Canaanite language left.\\n\\n- Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\".

It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws (').\\n\\n- Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"\\n\\n- Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud.

It is also traditionally referred to as, a Hebrew abbreviation of ', the \\"six orders\\", a reference to the six orders of the Mishnah. The term \\"Talmud\\" normally refers to the collection of writings named specifically the Babylonian Talmud \\"(Talmud Bavli)\\", although there is also an earlier collection known as the Jerusalem Talmud, or Palestinian Talmud\\"' \\"(Talmud Yerushalmi)\\".

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time.

In this study, we focused on one such self-attention network model, namely BERT, which has performed well in terms of stacking layers across diverse language-understanding benchmarks. However, in many downstream tasks, information between layers is ignored by BERT for fine-tuning. In addition, although self-attention networks are well-known for their ability to capture global dependencies, room for improvement remains in terms of emphasizing the importance of local contexts. In light of these advantages and disadvantages, this paper proposes SesameBERT, a generalized fine-tuning method that (1) enables the extraction of global information among all layers through Squeeze and Excitation and (2) enriches local information by capturing neighboring contexts via Gaussian blurring. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in the HANS dataset, which is used to determine whether models have adopted shallow heuristics instead of learning underlying generalizations. The experiments revealed that SesameBERT outperformed BERT with respect to GLUE benchmark and the HANS evaluation set.","target":"We proposed SesameBERT, a generalized fine-tuning method that enables the extraction of global information among all layers through Squeeze and Excitation and enriches local information by capturing neighboring contexts via Gaussian blurring","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe proposed SesameBERT, a generalized fine-tuning method that enables the extraction of global information among all layers through Squeeze and Excitation and enriches local information by capturing neighboring contexts via Gaussian blurring.\\""},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

In Drosophila, neural precursor cells rely heavily on ACD to generate the different cell types in the nervous system. A conserved protein machinery that regulates ACD has been identified in Drosophila, but how this machinery acts to allow the establishment of differential cell fates is not entirely understood.', 'To identify additional proteins required for ACD, we have carried out an in\\\\xa0vivo live imaging RNAi screen for genes affecting the asymmetric segregation of Numb in Drosophila sensory organ precursor cells. We identify Banderuola (Bnd), an essential regulator of cell polarization, spindle orientation, and asymmetric protein localization in Drosophila neural precursor cells. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that Bnd acts together with the membrane-associated tumor suppressor Discs-large (Dlg) to establish antagonistic cortical domains during ACD. Inhibiting Bnd strongly enhances the dlg phenotype, causing massive brain tumors upon knockdown of both genes. Because the mammalian homologs of Bnd and Dlg are interacting as well, Bnd function might be conserved in vertebrates, and it might also regulate cell polarity in higher organisms.","target":"Does the conserved discs-large binding partner Banderuola regulate asymmetric cell division in Drosophila?","rationale":"The given passage talks about the process of ACD, its role in neural precursor cells and how it influences the generation of different cell types.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India.

On March 1, 2017, it was announced that the Gaither Vocal Band lineup consisted of Reggie Smith, Wes Hampton, Adam Crabb, Todd Suttles, and Bill Gaither, as of April 1. Although the group started out recording contemporary Christian music in the 1980s, it became known for southern gospel after the popularity of the Gaither Homecoming videos. The lineup of the band changes often, with artists leaving to work on solo careers, and new and old ones coming to replace them.\\n\\nMichael English was hired as the new lead singer, so McSpadden was moved down to baritone, and Gaither dropped to the lowest part. At this point the group dropped the \\"new\\" part of their name. Although the previous album (New Point of View) had been more contemporary than its predecessors, the album with this version of the group (One X 1) took it even further. After this album, Larnelle left and was replaced by Lemuel Miller. The group did not record an album with Lemuel before he too left. He was replaced by Imperials alumnus, Jim Murray. This line up cut one album (Wings) before Gary McSpadden left to start his solo career. Mark Lowry was convinced to replace him. Along with a great voice, Lowry added comedy to the mix. Their Gospel roots project Homecoming in 1991 caused most Southern Gospel fans to welcome the Vocal Band with open arms. Jim Murray left and was replaced by Terry Franklin. The album Southern Classics was released in 1993 with the hit \\"I Bowed On My Knees\\".  Later Michael English left. He was replaced by Buddy Mullins. Mullins was only a temporary fill-in, but he was included on the album Testify. Terry Franklin soon left and was replaced by yet another Imperials alumnus, Jonathan Pierce (formerly known as Jonathan Hildreth, his first and last name--then changed to his first and middle name). Strengthened by the popularity of the Homecoming video series, the Vocal Band added Guy Penrod at lead. After Pierce's departure, Gaither hired David Phelps at tenor. After Lowry's departure, Imperials alumnus Russ Taff sang baritone for a couple of years. Marshall Hall was his replacement. Wes Hampton succeeded Phelps in 2005.  The group has had three number one songs on the Singing News chart. \\"Yes, I Know\\" held the top position from July to October 1997, as did \\"I Will Go On\\" in November 2006. \\"Greatly Blessed\\" was their third number one single.

India's two major political partiesâthe Indian National Congress and the Muslim Leagueâhad been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948.

Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of $50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid's hand.

Ricketts (January 15, 1853  January 19, 1939), often credited as Tom Ricketts, was an English stage and film actor and director who was a pioneer in the film industry. He portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in the first American film adaptation of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (1908), and directed one of the first motion pictures ever made in Hollywood. After directing scores of silent films, including the first film to be released by Universal Pictures, Ricketts became a prominent character actor.\\n\\n- A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.\\n\\n- An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- A character actor or character actress is a supporting actor who plays unusual, interesting, or eccentric characters. The term, often contrasted with that of leading actor, is somewhat abstract and open to interpretation. In a literal sense, all actors can be considered character actors since they all play \\"characters\\", but in the usual sense it is an actor who plays a distinctive and important supporting role. \\n\\n- Ebenezer Scrooge is the focal character of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, \\"A Christmas Carol\\".\\nAt the beginning of the novella, Scrooge is a cold-hearted miser who despises Christmas.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (19141978) is often called the \\"Godfather of Doo-wop\\" for his introducing the \\"top and bottom\\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics.\\n\\n- The Medallions were an American doo - wop vocal group led by Vernon Green ( 1937 -- 2000 ) .\\n\\n- The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.\\n\\n- Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular.\\nIn the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.\\n\\n- In music, harmony considers the process by which the composition of individual sounds, or superpositions of sounds, is analysed by hearing. Usually, this means simultaneously occurring frequencies, pitches (tones, notes), or chords. The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. Harmony is often said to refer to the \\"vertical\\" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the \\"horizontal\\" aspect. Counterpoint, which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.\\n\\n- Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a \\"libretto\\" and their writer, as a \\"librettist\\". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song.\\n\\n- Vernon Green (May 1, 1937  December 24, 2000) was leader of the rhythm and blues band The Medallions. He wrote the 1954 song \\"The Letter\\" which contained the nonsense lyric, \\"the puppetutes of love.\\" According to an interview with Green, puppetutes was \\"A term I coined to mean a secret paper-doll fantasy figure [thus puppet], who would be my everything and bear my children.\\"\\n\\n- Pittsburgh is a city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny County. The Combined Statistical Area (CSA) population of 2,659,937 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 20th-largest in the U.S. Located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which form the Ohio River, Pittsburgh is known as both \\"the Steel City\\" for its more than 300 steel-related businesses, and as the \\"City of Bridges\\" for its 446 bridges. The city features 30 skyscrapers, two inclines, a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the confluence of the rivers. The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest. The mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires, Virginia, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.\\n\\n- Vocal harmony is a style of vocal music in which a consonant note or notes are simultaneously sung as a main melody in a predominantly homophonic texture. Vocal harmonies are used in many subgenres of European art music, including Classical choral music and opera and in the popular styles from many Western cultures ranging from folk songs and musical theater pieces to rock ballads. In the simplest style of vocal harmony, the main vocal melody is supported by a single backup vocal line, either at a pitch which is above or below the main vocal line, often in thirds or sixths which fit in with the chord progression used in the song. In more complex vocal harmony arrangements, different backup singers may sing two or even three other notes at the same time as each of the main melody notes, mostly with consonant, pleasing-sounding thirds, sixths, and fifths (although dissonant notes may be used as short passing notes).\\n\\n- Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6-0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13-0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19-0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19-3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19-9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26-9.

A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1]","target":"Ecuador","rationale":"Ecuador is located near the equator, while Iceland is closer to the North Pole.

The Patriots deferred the opening coin toss, giving the Cardinals the ball to start the game. Without starting wide receiver Anquan Boldin, who was not active for the game with an injury, the Cardinals went three-and-out; Welker returned the punt 28 yards to the Cardinals' 33-yard line. Passing once on a seven-play drive and using backup offensive lineman Russ Hochstein as a fullback, the Patriots took a 7-0 lead on a 1-yard Jordan touchdown run. The Cardinals' ensuing possession was again a three-and-out, and a 36-yard punt by Ben Graham, released by the Jets earlier in the season, helped the Patriots start their next drive from their own 45-yard line. Two plays in, a Cassel pass to Morris went for 42 yards, putting the Patriots in the Cardinals' red zone. Jordan would soon score his second touchdown of the game on a 3-yard run that gave the Patriots a 14-0 lead. For their third straight possession, the Cardinals would be again forced to punt, facing a 4th-and-16 after a third down sack of quarterback Kurt Warner split by Seymour and Wright. However, the Patriots, despite starting from their own 44-yard line, were then forced to punt on a three-and-out drive. On the next play, which ended the first quarter, Mayo forced a fumble of Cardinals running back Tim Hightower on the Cardinals' 12-yard line that was recovered by former Patriots tight end Stephen Spach at the Cardinals' 4-yard line. Three plays later, the Cardinals punted to the Patriots, who began their next series from midfield. Two plays in, Cassel connected with Gaffney on a 37-yard completion, and then again to Faulk two plays later for a 15-yard touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 21-0. Beginning from their own 19-yard line the Cardinals moved to the Patriots' 31-yard line on nine plays, but could not convert a 4th-and-1 pass on the tenth play, turning the ball over on downs. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 69-play drive culminating in an 11-yard Welker touchdown catch that gave the Patriots a 28-0 lead; Welker celebrated by making a snow angel in the end zone, costing the Patriots 15 yards on an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. As a result, the Cardinals began their next drive from their own 39-yard line, but punted again after three plays. With 1:24 remaining in the first half, the Patriots then moved from their own 29-yard line to the Cardinals' 20-yard line, but could get no further and on the final play of the half, Gostkowski kicked a 38-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 31-0 lead. With the ball to begin the second half as the result of their opening coin toss deferral, the Patriots extended their lead to 38-0 on the first play, a screen pass to Moss that went for a 76-yard touchdown. The Cardinals again went three-and-out, and a 28-yard reception by Evans put the Patriots in Cardinals territory on one play. Nine plays later, on a 3rd-and-5 from the Cardinals' 5-yard line, Cassel was sacked by linebacker Karlos Dansby, setting up a 35-yard Gostkowski field goal that increased the Patriots' lead to 41-0. Yet another Cardinals three-and-out meant the Patriots began their next drive from the Cardinals' 49-yard line. An 11-play, 44-yard drive followed, and ended in a 24-yard Gostkowski field goal that put the Patriots' lead at 44-0. The field goal was Gostkowski's 33rd of the season, breaking Tony Franklin's record of 32 field goals in 1986. On their ensuing possession, the Cardinals converted a first down, but quarterback Matt Leinart, playing in place of Warner, was sacked for a loss of four yards, fumbling; the Cardinals recovered at their own 27-yard line. Two plays later, Leinart was strip-sacked by a blitzing Meriweather for a loss of 12 yards, but this time defensive lineman Jarvis Green recovered the ball for the Patriots at the Cardinals' 15-yard line. The Patriots would be unable to score, forcing Gostkowski to kick a 30-yard field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter, giving the Patriots a 47-0 lead. Leinart completed a 28-yard pass to wide receiver Jerheme Urban on the Cardinals' next drive, but Leinart's next pass attempt to Urban, two plays later, was tipped and intercepted by Hobbs at the Patriots' 37-yard line and returned for a loss of seven yards. With a 47-point lead, O'Connell replaced Cassel for the Patriots' next possession, which went three-and-out. An exchange of punts followed, giving the Cardinals the ball again at their own 29-yard line. Two plays in, Leinart threw a 78-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, putting the Cardinals on the board at 47-7. With six minutes left in the game, Jordan and Morris each ran three times for a first down each to bring the game to the two-minute warning; O'Connell then kneeled three times to end the game. The 47 points scored brought the Patriots to four 40-point games on the season, tying the team record set in 2007, and gave the Patriots the only back-to-back 40-point games of any NFL team in 2008.\\n\\nQuestion: How many yards was the shortest field goal?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"24","rationale":"The shortest field goal was the 24-yarder on a 3rd-and-5 from the Cardinals' 5-yard line by Gostkowski, giving Patriots lead to 41-0."},{"source":"In this task, you need to remove all words of a given length in the sentence.

In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel CarrÃ©'s libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production.

Saint-SaÃ«ns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died.

Iâve known her since school, and she was a bully, and after we both got into med school and I was part of her circle for the first 2 yrs, she would make fun of me in front of other people, make plans with the group without me, and generally make me feel not welcomed. My friends knew what was going on, but no one ever took action. \\n\\nAfter crying and feeling insecure, I abandoned that group of friends and made some new friends who treated me well. \\n\\nFast forward to the beginning of this year, when I learned that my boyfriend and her were both assigned to the same group, I was kind of annoyed, but I assumed that it would just be casual and that sheâs not the kind of person my boyfriend would be friends with. \\n\\nEventually, the entire group got close and started having frequent lunches together, celebrating birthdays, a Christmas dinner, carpooling, doing night shifts... but my issue is not with the group, itâs this specific girl, not only because of all the things she did to me, but she was getting increasingly annoying; she playfully joked around with my boyfriend, did annoying shit to get his attention when weâre talking, and acted like a diva. After a while I just stopped caring about the way I acted. \\n\\nMy bf has been telling me that sheâs changed and has become a nice person, and that sheâs really nice to him. He wishes we were on better terms. Weâve had so many arguments about her, and I tell myself Iâm going to tolerate it for his sake, because I want him to enjoy his time in uni and to have people that he can study with, &amp; it would be awkward if he just cut her off for the rest of the year. However, it has really put a strain on our relationship, made me cry many times, and has been making it difficult for me to focus on my school work. \\n\\nBecause I donât think sheâs a changed person, he said that he would try to get her to open up about what she thinks of me, and if she doesnât seem like she regrets what she did, he would end the friendship. So, last week, he asked her why we werenât friends, and her response was âitâs not that I donât like her, she doesnât like me, I donât like people who pretend to like me and then just suddenly start to ignore meâ. This was it for me; not once did she mention the reason of why I wouldnât like her, &amp; made it sound like I was rude. We had an argument &amp; my boyfriend asked if not being friends with her would solve our problem. I said yes. \\n\\nIs it mean of me to expect my bf to end his friendship with someone because of my issues with her? I feel really bad about it, but I just canât stand it anymore. I really love him, especially that heâs really nice to people, assumes the best in them, &amp; would never be mean to someone whoâs never done anything bad to him.","target":"OTHER","rationale":"The author is having a difficult time tolerating their boyfriend's friendship with another girl.

On Buffalo's next possession, following another Jets punt, Buffalo gambled and went for it on 4th-and-3 from the Jets' 28-yard line, but Losman's pass to Josh Reed only picked up two yards. The Jets capitalized, with rookie running back Leon Washington turning a short pass into a 46-yard gain to the Buffalo 3-yard line, where Kevan Barlow ran it in to tie the game, 7-7.

In 1998, Aerosmith released the number one hit \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\", which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum Ballbreaker (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \\"Keep the Faith\\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \\"Bed of Roses\\" (1993) and \\"Always\\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart.

They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s.

After forcing a Bears' punt, Rodgers marched the Packers 71 yards in 12 plays to take a 7-0 lead on a touchdown pass to Brandon Bostick on fourth-and-goal. The Bears' following possession lasted only two plays as Micah Hyde intercepted Jay Cutler and returned the ball 9 yards to the Bears 23-yard line. Four plays later Rodgers connected with Andrew Quarless for a 4-yard touchdown. After another punt by the Bears, the Packers went 72 yards in three plays. After the first two plays went for &#8722;1 yard, Rodgers hit Jordy Nelson for a 73-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the second quarter. After a three-and-out by the Bears offense, Rodgers once again hit Nelson for a 40-yard touchdown pass on the fourth play of the Packers responding drive. The Bears started to move the ball on their next drive as they drove 70 yards, but turned the ball over on downs at the Packers 4-yard line. The Packers responded by driving 95 yards with Rodgers hitting Eddie Lacy for a 56-yard touchdown on a screen pass, extending the lead to 35-0. The Bears turned the ball over on downs again on their next drive. After both teams lost fumbles, Rodgers hit Randall Cobb, making the score a 42-0 run-over. On their second possession of the second half, Mason Crosby extended the Packers' lead to 45-0. The Bears finally got the scoreboard on their next drive as Cutler connected with Brandon Marshall for a 45-yard touchdown pass to cap of a 75-yard drive. Crosby connected on a 20-yard field goal next and after a three-and-out each, Casey Hayward intercepted Cutler and returned it 82 yards for a touchdown, extending the score to 55-7 early in the fourth quarter. Chris Williams returned the ensuing kickoff 101 yards for a touchdown, making the final score 55-14. Rodgers threw six first-half touchdowns, which matched the Packers' single-game record (with Matt Flynn) and the NFL record for touchdowns in a half (with Daryle Lamonica, 1969). The final score of 55 points tied a Lambeau Field record and Rodgers threw his NFL-record 16th scoring pass of 70 yards or more.

Here, weâve compiled some of the most frequently asked questions that weâve received about octopuses. How the colossal squid feeds The colossal squid is a predator, and it hovers in the dark depths of the ocean looking for prey. We know that colossal squid eat toothfish â the squid on display was hauled up on a toothfish longline, still attached to the fish it had been eating. Toothfish caught on longlines often show signs of squid damage. Adult toothfish can grow up to two metres long, so the colossal squid is clearly a capable hunter, even in the dark. Effective predator Unfortunately, the giant squid Architeuthis has not been studied enough to make a comprehensive diet. From the few that have been dissected though, it was discovered that they would eat sperm whales that dive deep underwater. Squid are very adaptable though so they will find things to consume when they need to. They are going to consume any type of meat in the water, even if it is other squid when their normal sources have been depleted. This is a way for them to continue to evolve and to survive. The broadest list is: 1  Architeuthis dux, Atlantic giant squid. 2  Architeuthis hartingii. 3  Architeuthis japonica. 4  Architeuthis kirkii. 5  Architeuthis martensi, North Pacific giant squid. 6  Architeuthis physeteris. 7  Architeuthis sanctipauli, southern giant squid. 8  Architeuthis stockii.

Squids most commonly eat fish, crustaceans and other squids. Even the world's smallest squid is a predator, the southern pygmy squid (Idiosepius notoides). The females of this species grow to about 1 inch long, and males are about 3/4 inch. On the opposite end of the size spectrum is the giant squid (Architeuthis dux), the largest invertebrate in the world. One of the largest beaks ever recorded was on a 495-kilogram colossal squid. The beak had a lower rostral length of 42.5 millimeters.

Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours.

Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed.

Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants.

Fram left Christiania on 24 June 1893, seen on her way by a cannon salute from the fort and the cheers of thousands of well-wishers. This was the first of a series of farewells as Fram sailed round the coast and moved northward, reaching Bergen on 1 July (where there was a great banquet in Nansen's honour), Trondheim on 5 July and TromsÃ¸, north of the Arctic Circle, a week later.  The last Norwegian port of call was VardÃ¸, where Fram arrived on 18 July.  After the final provisions were taken on board, Nansen, Sverdrup, Hansen and Blessing spent their last hours ashore in a sauna, being beaten with birch twigs by two young girls.The first leg of the journey eastward took Fram across the Barents Sea towards Novaya Zemlya and then to the North Russian settlement of Khabarova where the first batch of dogs was brought on board.  On 3 August Fram weighed anchor and moved cautiously eastward, entering the Kara Sea the next day. Few ships had sailed the Kara Sea before, and charts were incomplete. On 18 August, in the area of the Yenisei River delta, an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander. Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned. The crew also experienced the dead water phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by energy dissipation caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water.

Greater evidence of such a people is found on Mallorca and Menorca than on Ibiza, but one of the Balearics' most important sites is actually on the island of Formentera, where the megalithic monument/tomb of Ca Na Costa has been dated to 2000 b.c. Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums.

And so you would think that people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that.\\"\\" \\"\\"People should know the facts,\\"\\" she added. The comment came one day after President Donald Trump announced his intention to halt U.S. funding to the WHO and review its handling of the virus. But the name of the disease doesnât mean the WHO had 18 chances to learn about coronaviruses before the latest strain hit. COVID-19 is short for \\"\\"coronavirus disease 2019,\\"\\" a name that reflects the year in which the disease was first identified. The WHO announced the name on Feb. 11. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \\"\\"CO\\"\\" stands for \\"\\"corona,\\"\\" \\"\\"VI\\"\\" stands for \\"\\"virus,\\"\\" and \\"\\"D\\"\\" stands for \\"\\"disease.\\"\\" Before the WHO formalized a name for the disease, it was referred to as the \\"\\"2019 novel coronavirus\\"\\" or \\"\\"2019-nCoV.\\"\\" The virus itself, by contrast, is known as \\"\\"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\\"\\" and abbreviated as \\"\\"SARS-CoV-2,\\"\\" according to the WHO. The CDC lists seven coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, some of which are relatively common. Conway was clearer about the origins of \\"\\"COVID-19\\"\\" during a separate interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo roughly 30 minutes after her comment on \\"\\"Fox & Friends.\\"\\" \\"\\"Itâs called COVID-19 because thatâs the year, thatâs the year,\\"\\" Conway said while ripping the WHOâs response to the coronavirus outbreak. \\"\\"Itâs not COVID-20. Itâs COVID-19.\\"\\" Facing blowback for her \\"\\"Fox & Friends\\"\\" comment, Conway tweeted the clip from her interview with Bartiromo. She said she knows \\"\\"19 refers to (the) year,\\"\\" but that she was making the point that the WHO \\"\\"should see pandemics coming\\"\\" because of the funding it gets from the U.S.  Dear @RepBobbyRush: I know 19 refers to year. Iâm in Task Force daily (Congress is out until May 4). Point: WHO has received billion$ from USA for decades; it should see pandemics coming & be honestWhich felt better:insulting me or endorsing Bloomberg for President?God bless https://t.co/3LpvkoQERb In a statement to PolitiFact, a White House official said Conway is \\"\\"well aware that â19â refers to the year\\"\\" and that she attends meetings held by the White Houseâs coronavirus task force. Conway was addressing \\"\\"the sheer number of years the U.S. has given billions and billions of dollars to WHO and were failed by them,\\"\\" the White House said, adding that in each of her April 15 interviews, she said the WHOâs job is to anticipate infectious disease pandemics. \\"\\"Kellyanne never mentioned â18 other coronaviruses,â\\"\\" the White House said. Conway said, \\"\\"This is COVID-19, not COVID-1,\\"\\" arguing that the WHO should have been better prepared to deal with the virus. \\"\\"People should know the facts,\\"\\" she added. We agree. The name of the disease caused by the coronavirus, COVID-19, doesnât mean itâs the 19th in a series of similar coronaviruses. The 19 refers to the year it was discovered, 2019. Conway made the claim with a straight-face, but she later said she knew what the name meant.\\" Claim: This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks.

Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: 'A', 'B, 'C', 'D', 'E'. LaTeX mathematical format (the standard way to express mathematical expressions in the typesetting software known as LaTeX) is used to express equations. Each question is solvable with high school math knowledge.

The officers simply told the tellers to pay on demand. The next morning a crowd gathered in the bank and on the sidewalk outside. The length of the line made many think that the bank could not possibly pay off everyone. People began to push and then to fight for places near the tellers' windows.

He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWould era B see higher or lower rate of weathering than era A?\\n\\nHint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.","target":"lower","rationale":"Weathering is the process of breaking down rocks and minerals into soil. It takes place when rainwater reacts chemically with rock particles in a region to break them down, or by carrying material away from the surface. Weathering happens at a faster rate if there are high levels of rainfall, because more water passes through the soil and creates chemical reactions that break down rock particles.\\nSince Sahara desert was experiencing higher rates of rainfall during era A than it did in era B (or less rainfall), this means that weathering would have occurred at a slower pace during era B compared to era A. So we can conclude that lower rate should be selected as an answer for above question"},{"source":"In this task, you will be shown an English sentence.

Any vitamin supplement that you and your doctor agree should be added to your diet can be taken with levothyroxine, provided that you don't take your vitamin or supplement within four hours of taking your thyroid replacement hormone. Before taking this medicine. Levothyroxine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems. Since thyroid hormone occurs naturally in the body, almost anyone can take levothyroxine. However, you may not be able to take this medicine if you have certain medical conditions. Tell your doctor if you have: Make sure to separate levothyroxine and antacids or gas-relieving medications by at least four hours. Antidepressant Medications Combining levothyroxine with some antidepressants may change the amount of levothyroxine your body needs, and your healthcare provider may need to adjust your levothyroxine dosage. It is also best to take both of these medications on an empty stomach. Take omeprazole at least 30 minutes before a meal.

No soy no iron: Although the packaging for levothyroxine says to take it on an empty stomach for many people its not possible to do that and take it consistently each day. As long as you take it at a consistent time and don't take it with soy or with iron which will interfere with its absorption it is fine to take it with breakfast or before bed without being strictly fasting. Antacids often used to treat heartburn and other intestinal distress, including calcium products such as TUMS or ROLAIDS and other antacids, may have absorption-inhibiting effects on thyroid medications. People should take levothyroxine four to six hours before or after taking these antacids.

The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said.

In a document released yesterday to justify its reordered priorities, the Council contended that Legal Aid can achieve greater economies of scale than lawyers appointed pursuant to Article 18-B of the County Law. The Council document also noted that \\"inexplicably\\" 18-B lawyers are handling 50 percent of the indigent criminal cases in New York City, even though their mandate is to handle only multi-defendant cases where the Legal Aid Society had a conflict. In past years, the City Council had consistently added $5.6 million to the $54.7 million proposed for the Legal Aid Society by former Mayor Giuliani, bringing the total to just a shade over $60 million. But this year for the first time, the Council is proposing shifting more than $20 million in funds earmarked by the Mayor for 18-B lawyers to the Legal Aid Society, which would increase its total funding to $80.4 million. That would reflect a jump in its current finding of about one-third.

I hate him for this.\\n\\n\\n\\nA little background info:\\n\\nMy parents have been divorced since I was 15, I'm 25 now. He cheated on my mother while stationed in South America and married her a year or so after the divorce. He then had a couple children with her, a son and daughter, a little later on. This was obviously upsetting for me, but did not ruin my relationship with him. I still loved him dearly. We didn't talk or see each other much since he got sent to Japan for the majority of the past decade, but he would come back once a year or so and we would spend a couple days together. He retired from the Air Force in late 2017 and began work as a civilian contractor back in the states in February of 2018.\\n\\nI don't know why, but we still rarely talked. The last time I spoke to him was January of 2017. This is now my absolutely deepest regret. I wish so much that I tried to reach out and tell him that I loved him more often...\\n\\nI got a call at 4 am on a Monday morning from his wife telling me that he had shot and killed himself. So I drove over 20 hours to be with her, my very young half siblings, and my grandparents. While there, I learned that my dad and stepmother had gotten into an argument due to him drinking excessively, so he was drunk when he did it. Apparently he would drink quite a bit almost every single night. It escalated into a very heated screaming match. She said she was going to call the cops. Apparently he told her, \\"If you call the cops, then it's all over\\". She ended up locking herself in the bathroom (not to call them, just to calm down) and while she was in there, she heard a gunshot come from the living room. My dad had shot himself in the head with an AK-47. \\n\\nNow to get to the point. \\n\\nI recently expressed to my sister that as much as I love my father and am still absolutely devastated, heartbroken and confused. I also *hate* him for what he's done. This upset my sister, she called me an asshole and was disappointed that I could hate my dad for it.\\n\\nI know mostly everyone would obviously be incredibly sad about this situation, but no one has ever brought up that you could be furiously angry with your loved one for killing themselves.\\n\\nI love him very much, but i undeniably hate him right now for killing himself.\\n\\nAm I an asshole for thinking this way?

It was insensitive of the daughter to say these things about their father in front of their mother as well.\\\\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes' because the daughter's actions were wrong: She should not have shared these negative feelings about their dad with people who are still grieving his loss.\\"\\n \\n</div>"},{"source":"OPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no\\nDoes \\"On the other hand, instruments such as the acoustic guitar, once associated mainly with popular music, gained prominence in classical music in the 19th and 20th centuries.\\" correctly answer the question of In what did the bagpipe fill an important role?","target":"no","rationale":"The bagpipe has a unique, distinctive sound due to its instrumentation.

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matÃ©riel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village DiscothÃ¨que, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime.

As I was mopping, she and the coworker were in my way and wouldn't move. I didn't think about asking them to move because I assumed they didn't need to be asked, but they just stood there having a nonchalant conversation because it wasn't that busy at the time. After I backed away from them and continued mopping, my manager said \\"You suck at mopping.\\" Right to my face. \\n\\nI replied with \\"I know\\" because I didn't know how else to respond to her remark without getting all bent out of shape. The thing is, I already had experience with mopping at a different restaurant. Being told that I suck at something that I'm experienced in by somebody higher up really pissed me off. After she said that, I could see the coworker snickering to himself.\\n\\nLater on, she asked me to wash the dishes. When we were in the back, she told me to \\"pay attention\\" to what I was doing. I have ADD. You can probably imagine how I felt after being told to pay attention for the 5 billionth time in addition to being insulted by a manager. I proceeded to angrily wash the dishes and then went back to the kitchen when I was done.\\n\\nAfter she left for the night, I went over to the only other manager that was present in the building (who just so happens to be the GM's son) and explained to him what happened. He told me that I could write a note to the GM that described my problem and leave it in the office for her to read the next morning, since he's never had to deal with a situation like mine before and that there was nothing he could do about it since he wasn't one of the higher-ups. \\n\\nSo that's what I did. I spent the last few minutes of my shift writing about how I interpreted the manager's comments as unprofessional and rude and that I wanted something to be done about the whole ordeal. I left the note in the office and then went home. \\n\\nFast forward to today -- I'm feeling nervous about going back to work. The store normally opens at 6 A.M., which means the note was probably discovered by one of the higher-ups earlier this morning while I was getting ready for school. I can't predict what will happen at work today. Will the GM or one of the higher-ups confront the manager? Will I get in trouble for leaving the note in the office?

The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production.

One of the leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house.\\n\\nOne of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \\"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own\\". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her \\"fascination with writing and storytelling\\" to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by \\"the great female country artists of the '90s\\"--Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \\"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it\\". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. She believes Parton is \\"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\\". Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.  Swift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: \\"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\\". McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \\"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that\\". She admires Springsteen for being \\"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\\". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: \\"It's not about fame for her, it's about music\\". \\"[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out\\", Swift says. She admires Simon's \\"songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person\\".  Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has \\"unwavering devotion\\" for Spears. In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World. She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch, Alanis Morissette, Ashlee Simpson, Fefe Dobson and Justin Timberlake; and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and \\"Like a Prayer-era Madonna\\".\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Taylor Swift","rationale":"The paragraph is about Taylor Swift, an American singer-songwriter."},{"source":"Who founded a fast food restaurant and also won a Heisman Trophy?","target":"Alan Ameche","rationale":"Alan Ameche founded a fast food restaurant called Alan's Drive-In and also won the Heisman Trophy in 1954."},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose father disowns her?\\n\\nThe year is 1965, and 10-year-old Sandra and her parents, Abraham and Sannie, are white Afrikaners.

As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia.\\n\\nHint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flowâand thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.","target":"Danny","rationale":"The question asks which friend had an excessive intake of vitamin D.

Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin.

Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in Blender likened it to a poorly-constructed building. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\".

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

Although the concept of DNA repair coupled with transcription has been widely accepted, its mechanisms remain elusive. We recently reported that in Chinese hamster ovary cells while ultraviolet light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) are preferentially repaired in the transcribed strand of dihydrofolate reductase gene, CPDs are efficiently repaired in both strands of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) locus, in either a transcribed or nontranscribed APRT gene (1). These results suggested that the transcription dependence of repair may depend on genomic context. To test this hypothesis, we constructed transfectant cell lines containing a single, actively transcribed APRT gene, integrated at different genomic sites. Mapping of CPD repair in the integrated APRT genes in three transfectant cell lines revealed two distinct repair patterns, either preferential repair of CPDs in the transcribed strand or very poor repair in both strands. Similar kinetics of micrococcal nuclease digestion were seen for all three transfectant APRT gene domains and endogenous APRT locus.

Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead.\\nOne scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \\"I'm dead--take me away.\\"\\nBut there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead.\\nWhat keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \\"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \\"I'm dead,\\" and the other set says, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\"\\nOther scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive.\\nChoe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \\"Wait-I'm not dead yet\\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \\"I'm dead\\" is left. \\"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases  new unique chemicals after death,\\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \\"dead\\" chemical without the \\"not dead yet\\" chemical, they drag away the body.\\nUnderstanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems.

We propose two types of length encoding: absolute and relative. Let pos and len be, respectively, a token position and the end of the sequence, both expressed in terms of number characters. Then, the absolute approach encodes the remaining length:\\n\\nwhere $i=1,\\\\ldots ,d/2$.\\n\\nSimilarly, the relative difference encodes the relative position to the end. This representation is made consistent with the absolute encoding by quantizing the space of the relative positions into a finite set of $N$ integers:\\n\\nwhere $q_N: [0, 1] \\\\rightarrow \\\\lbrace 0, 1, .., N\\\\rbrace $ is simply defined as $q_N(x) = \\\\lfloor {x \\\\times N}\\\\rfloor $. As we are interested in the character length of the target sequence, len and pos are given in terms of characters, but we represent the sequence as a sequence of BPE-segmented subwords BIBREF17.

Atlanta lost starting strong safety Lawyer Milloy in the first half after he took a shot to the ribs and played the entire game without starting left tackle Sam Baker.  In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as Panthers RB Jonathan Stewart getting an 8-yard TD run.  The Falcons responded with kicker Jason Elam getting a 33-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Falcons crept closer as Elam kicked a 44-yard field goal.However, Carolina answered with quarterback Jake Delhomme completing a 56-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith.  Atlanta closed out the half with Elam getting a 44-yard field goal. The Panthers (3-1, 1-0) lost starting offensive tackles Jordan Gross and Jeff Otah in the game to injury and also went several series without starting cornerback Ken Lucas.

He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which SigurÃ°ur gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. SigurÃ°ur was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12â16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.SigurÃ°ur was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment.

Muscles atrophy when they are not used, and over time if atrophy is prolonged, muscle cells die. It is therefore important that those who are susceptible to muscle atrophy exercise to maintain muscle function and prevent the complete loss of muscle tissue. In extreme cases, when movement is not possible, electrical stimulation can be introduced to a muscle from an external source. This acts as a substitute for endogenous neural stimulation, stimulating the muscle to contract and preventing the loss of proteins that occurs with a lack of use. Physiotherapists work with patients to maintain muscles. They are trained to target muscles susceptible to atrophy, and to prescribe and monitor exercises designed to stimulate those muscles. There are various causes of atrophy, including mechanical injury, disease, and age. After breaking a limb or undergoing surgery, muscle use is impaired and can lead to disuse atrophy. If the muscles are not exercised, this atrophy can lead to long-term muscle weakness. A stroke can also cause muscle impairment by interrupting neural stimulation to certain muscles. Without neural inputs, these muscles do not contract and thus begin to lose structural proteins. Exercising these muscles can help to restore muscle function and minimize functional impairments. Age-related muscle loss is also a target of physical therapy, as exercise can reduce the effects of age-related atrophy and improve muscle function. The goal of a physiotherapist is to improve physical functioning and reduce functional impairments; this is achieved by understanding the cause of muscle impairment and assessing the capabilities of a patient, after which a program to enhance these capabilities is designed. Some factors that are assessed include strength, balance, and endurance, which are continually monitored as exercises are...\\n\\n\\nQ: What kinds of cells that are important to our physical functioning can atrophy when they are not used?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"muscles","rationale":"The paragraph explains that muscle cells do not regenerate; instead, they are replaced by connective or adipose tissue.
