AMK has shown noteworthy promoting effect on improving gastrointestinal function and immunity, which might represent a promising candidate for the treatment of intestinal mucosa injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of AMK on intestinal mucosal restitution and the underlying mechanisms via intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cell migration model.', 'A cell migration model of IEC-6 cells was induced by a single-edge razor blade along the diameter of the cell layers in six-well polystyrene plates. After wounding, the cells were grown in control cultures and in cultures containing spermidine (5μM, SPD, reference drug), alpha-difluoromethylornithine (2.5mM, DFMO, polyamine inhibitor), AMK (50, 100, and 200mg/L), DFMO plus SPD and DFMO plus AMK for 12h. The polyamines content was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with pre-column derivatization. The Rho mRNAs expression levels were assessed by Q-RT-PCR. The Rho and non-muscle myosin II proteins expression levels were analyzed by Western blot. The formation and distribution of non-muscle myosin II stress fibers were monitored with immunostaining techniques using specific antibodies and observed by confocal microscopy. Cell migration assay was carried out using inverted microscope and the Image-Pro Plus software. All of these indexes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of AMK.', '(1) Treatment with AMK caused significant increases in cellular polyamines content and Rho mRNAs and proteins expression levels, as compared to control group. Furthermore, AMK exposure increased non-muscle myosin II protein expression levels and formation of non-muscle myosin II stress fibers, and resulted in an acceleration of cell migration in IEC-6 cells. (2) Depletion of cellular polyamines by DFMO resulted in a decrease of cellular polyamines levels, Rho mRNAs and proteins expression, non-muscle myosin II protein formation and distribution, thereby inhibiting IEC-6 cell migration. AMK not only reversed the inhibitory effects of DFMO on the polyamines content, Rho mRNAs and proteins expression, non-muscle myosin II protein formation and distribution, but also restored cell migration to control levels.","target":"Does atractylodes macrocephala Koidz stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration through a polyamine dependent mechanism?","rationale":"The question must be about intestinal epithelial cell migration.

POST : We'd been friends for 8 years and she had a hard life and went through a lot of shit in her life - narcissistic mother who was manipulative and kicked her out often until she managed to move out at 20ish years old. I tried my best to be there for her and support her, talking and letting her stay over my uni house for a couple days and so on.\\n\\nWe lost contact for a bit but then reconnected when I was in the final year of my undergraduate and began my masters. I lived an hour away by train.\\n\\nWe messaged everyday, met up and played video games often but gradually I became busier and struggled more with my mental health. I cancelled on meeting up more often than I would go and wouldn't have time for video games or two hour phone calls.\\n\\nShe got tired with me not giving her enough attention and we had an argument over me not spending enough time with her. I apologised and promised it wouldn't happen again. I worked hard to meet up and play video games over the coming months.\\n\\nBut unfortunately my mental health decreased further with increased stress from my Masters course, working 3 days a week and struggling with self harm and feelings of suicide. I made sure that I messaged her every day to stay in touch but had to consistently turn down gaming requests and phone calls - which would be a minimum of 2 hours. I was barely surviving getting out of bed, working on my thesis and eating. I hadn't even switched on my tv or hung out with uni friends for the past two months.\\n\\nA week before my birthday and deadline for my thesis project, I get a message after cancelling on a meet up i made in a brief moment of positivity, telling me that she deserves better people in her life, has tried to be there for me but needs to think of herself, then calls me a selfish bitch and that she needs a friend now and cant wait another second. \\n\\nI begged for another chance, promised to change and cried my eyes out, but she said goodbye.\\n\\n\\n I graduated and moved back home a week later. Some time passed with no contact other than her liking my photos on Instagram. I was mad that she thought she could cut me out of her life that way and then continue to like my photos, so I blocked her.\\n\\nShe confronted me about blocking her and then we spoke again about what happened and she tried to understand my side of the story, apologised for what she said and I accepted and apologised for not thinking of her feelings and how me not spending time with her made her feel, especially considering her anxiety, depression and abandonment issues stemming from her mother. \\n\\nBut I was still absolutely furious about what had happened and grieved the loss of the friendship. \\n\\nWe spoke for a bit but i realised that i hadnt forgiven her for the way she treated me. I went on a night out with my old school friends and it made me realise that even though we'd (school friends) met up 3-4 times a year and spoken infrequently, we all were just thrilled to see each other and understood that life gets in the way but doesn't affect our friendship and love for each other. Even when I'd cancelled on meeting up with them more often than not and they had done the same to me.\\n\\nI got drunk and angry, reread all the old messages and sent a strongly worded text telling my best friend to go fuck herself, that it was over. She was draining and self-centred. I'm not the meek little mousy girl who would follow her around anymore and be treated like shit at the worst and lowest moment of my life.\\n\\nFurther texts were sent back and forth and I didn't hold back. I was a dick about it. I could have been nicer, but I was so angry and just relieved that I had finally said what had been bubbling away since she sent that text before my birthday and I'd rolled over and begged for her back.\\n\\nI regret the way I did it, but I don't regret the outcome. \\n\\nIt probably makes me a cunt, but I'm glad it's over. I would have been cut out again by her later on and made to feel like shit later in my life when I got a full time job/partner/moved because life just fucking happens, I don't owe anyone my time in the way she seemed to expect from me. \\n\\nSo yeah, I've tried to be honest here and not leave anything out.\\n\\nWhat do you guys think, am I the arsehole for ending the friendship?","target":"no","rationale":"The author's friendship with their best friend was difficult to maintain because the author struggled with mental health issues.

Wright composed \\"See-Saw\\" and \\"Remember a Day\\". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on \\"Remember a Day\\", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, \\"Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'\\". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking \\"like an architectural diagram\\".Released in June 1968, the album featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to \\"forget it as background music to a party\\". John Peel described a live performance of the title track as \\"like a religious experience\\", while NME described the song as \\"long and boring ... [with] little to warrant its monotonous direction\\". On the day after the album's UK release, Pink Floyd performed at the first ever free concert in Hyde Park.

Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor.\\n\\nWhich ocean had more volcanoes blasting rocky debris high above its surface?\\n\\nHint: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts.","target":"Tropical","rationale":"Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor, hence it could have blasted more rocky debris high above its surface.

Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in Passive solar building design, greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright, in the 1960s by Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg and Sim Van der Ryn in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques. The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this.","target":"Passive solar building design","rationale":"The context describes architects that have begun to endorse environmental sustainability, and discusses various examples of this. One such example is Passive solar building design - the use of a structure's windows and insulation in order to heat buildings using sun rays (solar energy).\\nThis answer best matches with the question given: \\"Which illustraion uses nuclear fission from the star around which Earth orbits\\". Nuclear fusion powers stars by fusing atoms together into heavier elements. The Sun provides light through this process, so it can be reasonably inferred that sunlight comes from our star’s own nuclear fusion reactions taking place at its core. This makes passive solar building design an appropriate choice for generating power utilizing these principles as well as being environmentally sustainable."},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- Bunge Land or Zemlya Bunge is a huge empty and almost barren intermediate zone in the Anzhu Islands north of Siberia .

Small C-terminal deletions in the protein lead to a severe growth defect. In the case of a 22-residue C-terminal deletion this can be suppressed by intragenic mutations in the RIA1 gene or dominant extragenic mutations in TIF6, which is thought to be involved in the biogenesis of the 60S subunit of the ribosome. The dominant TIF6 alleles can also suppress the phenotype associated with a complete deletion of the RIA1 gene. Depletion of Ria1p has a dramatic effect on the polysome profile: there is a severe reduction in the level of the 80S monosomes, an imbalance in the 40S/60S ratio, and halfmers appear. Dissociation of the monosomes and polysomes in the Ria1p depletion mutant revealed a specific reduction in the amount of 60S subunits. Localization experiments with HA-tagged derivatives of Ria1p did not detect any stable association of Ria1p with ribosome subunits, 80S monosomes or polysomes. Cell fractionation experiments show that Ria1p is found in both the cytoplasmic fraction and the nuclear fraction. Taken together, these data suggest that Ria1p is involved in the biogenesis of the 60S subunit of the ribosome..

We had no closure and that bothered me quite badly but with time I realized that it’s not on me, I tried but she refused to. Her and I had been together for three years and I moved to Germany to be with her and in that time her family became very good friends of mine, therefor I would go to church on Sundays, the same church her mom goes to and we’d talk for a few minutes afterwards. Nothing more than that. I recently returned to the little German town on Thursday and went to go pick up a box of stuff that she found that was mine. During that time I asked her if I would be seeing her at church that Sunday and she said yes. So, Sunday comes around and I go to church and she shows up a bit late with her dog, everything goes as normal and afterwards her and I start talking a bit, she’s not doing well because of her depression and she has a lot of worries so I asked if she’d like to talk about them, she said yes so we started walking back to her place (about 5 minutes from the church) and she told me what’s going on. Then, my ex comes out and walks right past me without saying a word. I thought it was a bit rude but I understood that she didn’t want to see or talk to me. I went home and she proceeded to text me that I’m not allowed to go to church there anymore because it’s “weird to be doing anything with my mother, you need to move on.” I really don’t want to stop going there, it’s small, I like the sense of community it has and as I’m not very religious, if I didn’t go there I most likely wouldn’t go at all. But it always felt special there. She threatened to bring her ex/new boyfriend with her to church if I continued to go there and they’d harass me, neither of them go to church regularly / at all.

Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

Whether IL-18 alters basal metabolic rate or metabolic processes of living is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that IL-18 modulates weight gain, energy intake, whole-body energy expenditure, and utilization of lipid as a fuel substrate in high-fat diet fed mice.   \\n METHODS Food intake, whole-body metabolism, and motor activity of IL-18 knockout mice were compared to those of wildtype littermates; anorectic effects of intracerebroventricular IL-18 administration were compared between IL-18 receptor knockout, IL-18/IL-18R knockout and wildtype mice.   \\n RESULTS Chow-reared IL-18 knockout mice were overweight at 6 months of age and then gained excess weight on both low-fat and high-fat diets, ate more high-fat diet, and showed reduced whole-body energy expenditure and increased respiratory exchange ratios. Reductions in energy expenditure of IL-18 knockout mice were seen across fasting vs. feeding conditions, low- vs. high-fat diets, high vs. low levels of physical activity and times of day, suggesting actions on basal metabolic rate. The circadian amplitude of energy expenditure, but not respiratory exchange ratio, food intake, or motor activity, also was blunted in IL-18 knockout mice. Central IL-18 administration reduced high-fat diet intake in wildtype mice, but not in mice lacking the IL-18 receptor.   \\n CONCLUSION The loss-of-function results support the hypothesis that endogenous IL-18 suppresses appetite and promote energy expenditure and lipid fuel substrate utilization not only during sickness, but also in healthy adults consuming high-fat diets.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the objective of the study, relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.\\n\\nParagraph: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift.

Apricots are a fruit similar to plums and pears in appearance and taste, so they can be expected to have similar properties as well.

In the 1930s the LPO had flourished, but since Beecham's departure in 1940, it had struggled to survive. Boult was well known to the orchestra, having been among the musicians who came to its aid in 1940. He took over as chief conductor of the LPO in June 1950, immediately after leaving the BBC, and threw himself into the task of rebuilding it. In the early years of his conductorship, the finances of the LPO were perilous, and Boult subsidised the orchestra from his own funds for some time. The need to earn money obliged the orchestra to play many more concerts than its rivals. In the 1949–50 season, the LPO gave 248 concerts, compared with 55 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra, and 32 apiece by the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic orchestras.\\nAlthough he had worked extensively in the studio for the BBC, Boult had, up to this point, recorded only a part of his large repertoire for the gramophone.  With the LPO he began a series of commercial recordings that continued at a varying rate for the rest of his working life. Their first recordings together were Elgar's Falstaff, Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen with the mezzo Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven's First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by the reviewers. Of the Elgar, The Gramophone wrote, \\"I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult's] performance. ... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably\\". In The Manchester Guardian, Neville Cardus wrote, \\"Nobody is better able than Sir Adrian Boult to expound the subtly mingled contents of this master work.\\"In January 1951 Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Kennedy as \\"gruelling\\", with 12 concerts on 12 successive days.

It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion.

It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors.

The whole World was spinning, my stomach fighting itself, my legs were cramping and there was not enough air for my desperate lungs. At first my boyfriend tried his best to help me. Did hold my hair while I kissed the toilet and gave me something to Drink. He is really afraid of me getting pregnant and insisted on me taking my birth control pill while still vomiting. So I of course threw asap up end sent it on a journey through the toilet System. At this Moment I was just shaking and was almost not able to get back to bed. Two hours later (I finally Was able to sleep and escape my pain!), he woke me up and told me to take my pill again, because He read, tagt this is the thing to do. And here is the Part where I really fucked up: I forgot to take an extra blister! So there is no way I can take another one, it is 1 am and we are in the middle of nowhere without a pharmacy. And He got mad, so so mad at me. And I can totally understand that but I am still shaking in agony and throwing up again (so I really doubt that I would be able to even keep the second pill). And He is screaming at me and insulting me and taking away the pillow He gave me, so I can sit up a little (way better for my stupid still Wrestling tummy) and pushing me out of the way (not so great for my stupid stomach). I tried to calm him down (I am at the end of my zyclus and we did not have Sex very often and the only time where something could have happened is two days ago and He did not even Come into me - I know that that is not a safe method, that's why I am taking birth control pills, but just to calm him down a little and I am still feeling sooooooo Bad). I started crying cause it was all to much and begged him to just be a little nicer to me and help me and maybe hug me, because I really could not bare it any longer. He did nothing of that. I spend the whole night shaking and wishing to Die, while He ignored me and sometimes even pushed me, when I came too close to him.\\n\\nAnd here we are, the day after sitting in front of the only pharmacy and waiting for it too open. The pharmacist told us Over the phone that there is no reason to be concerned, that I just can take the pill after, but she will not open till 11 am (we are sitting here since 7:30).

It is an homage to the great cliff hangers of early cinema. Many scenes from these films come right out of Dick Tracey and other serials.Harrison Ford plays Dr. Jones an archeologist and adventurer who seeks to place precious relics in museum hands and out of the reach of scoundrels who use the antiquities for their own gains, and in the Nazis case their own agenda. To find out more about the film and why it is such a great adventure and a classic series I suggest viewing this set.I carry very fond memories of this series and I have enjoyed all the adventures of Indiana Jones. The box comes with 4 disc. The picture is sharp and the sound is in THX for those who have a certified system. The menus are nice here too and feature changing picture clips and music from the film.  One of the drawbacks of this set for me however was the absence of a director commentary on each disc and there are no German subtitles nor German language options. Those of you who have seen this series know that two of the three films featured the use of sparse German dialog and it would be nice to read what was said. The extra features have been saved to the fourth disc which includes a making of and other behind the scenes you would come to expect. I would however liked to have seen more from Lucas and Spielberg about their films and get some answers on what we can expect to see in the next film. Over all I was very pleased with the box set and look forward to seeing the Lucas Star Wars Trilogy come to DVD in a similar fashion.\\nquestion: Is the movie transfer good?","target":"A tale of heroes and adventure finally","rationale":"The question asks if the movie transfer is good, and the text span \\"A tale of heroes and adventure finally\\" mentions that the movie is on DVD, which suggests that it has been transferred from film to digital media.

KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views.

Passage 1:The Battle of Badr (), fought on Tuesday, 13 March 624 CE (17 Ramadan, 2 AH in the Islamic calendar) in the Hejaz region of western Arabia (present-day Saudi Arabia), was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraish in Mecca. The battle has been passed down in Islamic history as a decisive victory attributable to divine intervention, or by secular sources to the strategic genius of Muhammad. It is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Quran. All knowledge of the battle at Badr comes from traditional Islamic accounts, both hadiths and biographies of Muhammad, recorded in written form some time after the battle. There is little evidence outside of these of the battle. There are no descriptions of the battle prior to the 9th century.\\n Passage 2:Gresham was born to William Gresham (1802–1834) and his wife Sarah Davis. William had been elected a Colonel in the militia of Indiana. He was a member of the Whig Party and was elected Sheriff of Harrison County, Indiana. On January 26, 1834, William was fatally stabbed while assisting in the arrest of Levi Sipes, a so-called \\"desperado\\". His paternal grandparents were George Gresham (born 1776) and Mary Pennington. George was born in Virginia but later settled in Kentucky. He moved to Indiana in 1809. Mary was the only sister of Dennis Pennington, speaker of the first Indiana Senate. George Gresham was a son of Lawrence Gresham. Lawrence was born in England but moved to the Colony of Virginia in 1759. He initially served as an indentured servant of an uncle. He was released from service upon reaching adulthood. He later served in the Continental Army. He married Sarah O'Neal. Lawrence followed his son to Kentucky and Indiana well into his old age.\\n Passage 3:The 1995–96 NBA season was the Bulls' 30th season in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Bulls acquired rebound-specialist Dennis Rodman from the San Antonio Spurs, and signed free agent Randy Brown. Midway through the season, the team signed John Salley, who was released by the expansion Toronto Raptors. Salley won championships with the Detroit Pistons along with Rodman in 1989 and 1990. The 1996 Bulls is regarded to be the greatest Jordan team of the 90s and undoubtably of all time. This saw the Bulls set the record for most wins in an NBA regular season in which they won the championship, finishing with 72 wins and 10 losses. The regular season record was broken by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors, who finished 73–9. The Warriors(2015-2016) have a connection to the (1995-1996) Bulls team, as Steve Kerr, the current Golden State coach, was a reserve point guard with the Bulls.","target":"3","rationale":"The given question only requires the number of seasons that the NBA has been in operation and this information can be found in passage 3."},{"source":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true:\\n\\nAdriano Correia Claro (born 26 October 1984), known simply as Adriano, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Turkish club Beşiktaş JK.

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\".\\n\\n(This is my first post here, tell me if I do something wrong)\\n\\nSome context: \\n\\nMy birthday is right around christmas, and so usually my family combines both of those celebrations to get me one gift per year (I'm only 17, turning 18 soon, and so I live with both my parents). I know, it already sucks enough.\\n\\nI also have grown up with a huge respect for money, because I've not been allowed to have a job, so I spend the money that I get very wisely. That's why, I usually look to any opportunities to minimize family spending, meaning that I usually only ask for one expensive thing a year during that one period. That being said, if something is too expensive, if one of my parents tell me that buying that thing is impossible for financial reasons, then I've never argued with them about it.\\n\\nFor reasons that will become clear in a bit, I'm a decently athletic person, with a decently healthy lifestyle, and I go the the gym very regularly, though I don't enjoy exercising.\\n\\nNow to get into the story:\\n\\nI ask my dad for a set of those trendy new true wireless earbuds. The ones I request cost around $140. Pretty expensive, I know, but not out of this world costly. My dad says no, because he's ordered me an exercise bike/desk combo (yeah, seriously) that costs around $170.\\n\\nAs I said before, I'm a pretty healthy guy, so believe me when I say I do not need this bike. This is not a passive-aggressive push towards a better lifestyle because I'm not unhealthy to start with. Naturally, I politely tell my dad that I'd rather not get that, because for my yearly gift, I would rather have something that I actually want. I ask him to cancel the order. \\n\\nI'm fairly adamant about this, and my mom is on my side, and so one day my dad tells me that he ordered the earbuds. However, the ones he ordered are of much lower quality ($50) than the ones that I asked for. He orders them prior to telling me though, so I can't protest. However, he says that if the earbuds are not of good quality, he will return them.\\n\\nI'm somewhat peeved, but decide to give them a try. They arrive, I test them, and they're what I expected: okay but not great. I'm probably somewhat biased, but after reading reviews, it's clear that there is a significant drop in audio quality.\\n\\nSo, I text my dad if he can return them. Here's where the problems begin. He accuses me of taking him for granted and caring about simply the price of things instead of the feelings behind them. He claims that neither I, nor my brother (he's eight years old!) have any gratitude for him. \\n\\nI then explain excessively politely that I'm simply annoyed at how he always buys things first and then tells me after the fact (this has happened several times where he buys something different from what I ask, and I am too timid to speak out). \\n\\nThis receives no reply.\\n\\nI then say \\"Also, about (brother). He is far too young for you to have the expectation of him showing gratitude. You can have it for me, but not for him. Please dont extend any of this onto him because he definitely doesnt deserve it.\\"\\n\\nHe blows up and accuses me of teaching him how to parent, and refuses to speak to me afterwards, not replying to any explanations that I have.\\n\\nAITA for thinking that instead of buying a $170 chair and $50 earbuds, he could've simply bought the $140 earbuds and called it a day? \\nAITA for expecting him to speak to me before buying stuff for me?\\nAITA for trying to protect my brother from my dad's toxicity? \\n\\nFor the cherry on top:\\n\\nThe chair and the earbuds have not been returned. The earbuds are being charged and the bike has been assembled. I'm fairly sure that he's using both of them, or at least planning to. So I'm left with no present whatsoever. I'm suspicious that he bought the bike knowing he would be the one using it anyway. I'm not sure because we haven't spoken in three days.\\n\\nFor years now, my dad has emotionally blackmailed me in ways like this, and it always results in days of not speaking to eachother before my mom (an angel btw) convinces me to go and apologize several times to maintain the relationship. I'm beginning to think that silence is better than continuously sacrificing my dignity.\\n\\nHere's to the new year. \\n\\nP.S. The reason this is even a post is because of how convinced my dad is that he is right. Maybe there is something I'm missing.","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"Given the anecdote, the author has acted ethically.

It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings.

HCMV establishes lifelong latent infections and, after periodic reactivation from latency, uses a panel of immune evasion proteins to survive and replicate in the face of robust, fully primed host immunity. Monocyte/macrophages are important host cells for HCMV, serving as a latent reservoir and as a means of dissemination throughout the body. Macrophages and other HCMV-permissive cells, such as endothelial and glial cells, can express MHC class II proteins and present antigens to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Here, we show that the HCMV protein US2 causes degradation of two essential proteins in the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway: HLA-DR-α and DM-α. This was unexpected, as US2 has been shown to cause degradation of MHC class I (refs. 5,6), which has only limited homology with class II proteins. Expression of US2 in cells reduced or abolished their ability to present antigen to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Thus, US2 may allow HCMV-infected macrophages to remain relatively 'invisible' to CD4+ T cells, a property that would be important after virus reactivation.","target":"False","rationale":"It is not a structured abstract because it does not include a topic sentence, relevant supporting sentences, and closing sentence.

In the Puerto Rico youth league, Gonzalez batted cleanup behind future Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams, where both competed against Gonzalez's future teammate Ivan Rodriguez. When the Yankees scouted Williams, eventually signing him, they declined to pursue Gonzalez, who they perceived as not serious about baseball.  The Texas Rangers signed Gonzalez as an amateur free agent on May 30, 1986, at the age of 16. Gonzalez has always wanted to serve as a role model for the kids of Puerto Rico, as they are faced with the downfalls of drugs and prostitution frequently. Gonzalez avoided such temptations growing up. His father, a math teacher, and mother, a housewife, made sure Gonzalez and his two sisters behaved properly and stayed away from negative influences. Gonzalez moved his family out of the barrio early in his MLB career. He paid utility bills for down-on-their-luck friends and plans on working to construct recreation facilities and a baseball diamond in his home town. One of Juan's managers, Johnny Oates, believed that until you've walked where Juan Gonzalez has walked, you just won't understand.

During the Renaissance era, the French Boleroroyals \\"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\\". Baroque-era composers include Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and François Couperin and were popular. The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795.

On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush.

Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained.

Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity.

Their collaboration created several hit songs (as well as a small record label, XYZ), for which Crewe performed as the demo singer. Crewe and Slay's 1957 recording session with the Rays for XYZ (picked up nationally by Cameo Records) produced two major hit songs. \\"Silhouettes\\", produced by Crewe, became a doo-wop anthem of the era. Climbing to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1957, \\"Silhouettes\\" displayed the flair for story-driven lyrics, innovative musical hooks, and final lyrical twists that were to become known as Crewe trademarks. In 1965, with a slightly faster tempo, \\"Silhouettes\\" again became a hit, this time for the British group Herman's Hermits, reaching #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Bob Dylan recorded \\"Silhouettes\\" during his legendary Basement Tapes sessions of the late 1960s, although his version was not released until 2014.  \\"Daddy Cool\\" was the B-side of the Rays' \\"Silhouettes\\" single.

When I was a child (50’s-60) it was common for All medicine chests to be supplied with Charcoal. I still keep some of that in My medicine chest. I live in a rural area. It would take me 45 minutes to get to a Medical facility.

At present there is no agreed-on set of public health competencies delineating the knowledge and skills that family physicians should possess to effectively face diverse public health challenges. Using a multi-staged, iterative process that included a detailed literature review, the authors developed a set of public health competencies relevant to primary care, identifying competencies relevant across four levels, from \\"post-MD\\" to \\"enhanced.\\" Feedback from family medicine and public health educator-practitioners regarding the set of proposed \\"essential\\" competencies indicated the need for a more limited, feasible set of \\"priority\\" areas to be highlighted during residency training. This focused set of public health competencies has begun to guide relevant components of the University of Toronto's Family Medicine Residency Program curriculum, including academic half-days; clinical experiences, especially identifying \\"teachable moments\\" during patient encounters; resident academic projects; and elective public health agency placements. These competencies will also be used to guide the development of a family medicine-public health primer and faculty development sessions to support family medicine faculty facilitating residents to achieve these competencies. Once more fully implemented, an evaluation will be initiated to determine the degree to which these public health competencies are being achieved by family medicine graduates, especially whether they attained the knowledge, skills, and confıdence necessary to effectively face diverse public health situations-from common to emergent.

First, he visited a dense forest. He marked it as location A. Then he visited a grassland, which he marked as location B. After that, he visited a location where he did not find any sign of drought. He marked it as time A. He then visited the same location a year later, and found that the place was facing a severe drought. He marked it as time B.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from...\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Would time B see less or more wildfires than time A?","target":"more","rationale":"The background information provided states that wildfires occur when there is an ignition source, combustible material like vegetation, enough heat and oxygen.

However, the regulators of fibrotic differentiation of these resident mesenchymal cells are not well understood.   \\n OBJECTIVES This study examines the role of endogenous and exogenous prostaglandin (PG)E2 as a modulator of fibrotic differentiation of human lung allograft-derived MSCs.   \\n METHODS Effect of PGE2 on proliferation, collagen secretion, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression was assessed in lung-resident MSCs (LR-MSCs) derived from patients with and without BOS. The response pathway involved was elucidated by use of specific agonists and antagonists.   \\n MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS PGE2 treatment of LR-MSCs derived from normal lung allografts significantly inhibited their proliferation, collagen secretion, and α-SMA expression. On the basis of pharmacologic and small-interfering RNA approaches, a PGE2/E prostanoid (EP)2/adenylate cyclase pathway was implicated in these suppressive effects. Stimulation of endogenous PGE2 secretion by IL-1β was associated with amelioration of their myofibroblast differentiation in vitro, whereas its inhibition by indomethacin augmented α-SMA expression. LR-MSCs from patients with BOS secreted significantly less PGE2 than non-BOS LR-MSCs. Furthermore, BOS LR-MSCs were found to be defective in their ability to induce cyclooxygenase-2, and therefore unable to up-regulate PGE2 synthesis in response to IL-1β. BOS LR-MSCs also demonstrated resistance to the inhibitory actions of PGE2 in association with a reduction in the EP2/EP1 ratio.   \\n CONCLUSIONS These data identify the PGE2 axis as an important autocrine-paracrine brake on fibrotic differentiation of LR-MSCs, a failure of which is associated with BOS.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the rationale of the study (\\"RATIONALE Donor mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) expansion and fibrotic differentiation is associated with development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in human lung allografts.

The strike was fought vigorously by the coal mine operators association and its steering committee, which included Welborn, president of CF&I, a spokesman for the coal operators. Rockefeller's operative, Lamont Montgomery Bowers, remained in the background. Few miners actually belonged to the union or participated in the strike call, but the majority honored it. Strikebreakers (called \\"scabs\\") were threatened and sometimes attacked. Both sides purchased substantial arms and ammunition. Striking miners were forced to abandon their homes in company towns and lived in tent cities erected by the union, such as the tent city at Ludlow, a railway stop north of Trinidad.  Under the protection of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, a substantial portion of the troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado.  Due to reduced demand for coal, resulting from an economic downturn, many of CF&I's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.  The casualties suffered at Ludlow were successfully labeled a massacre and mobilized public opinion against the Rockefellers and the coal industry. The United States Commission on Industrial Relations conducted extensive hearings, singling out John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Rockefellers' relationship with Bowers for special attention. Bowers was relieved of duty and Wellborn restored to control in 1915, then industrial relations improved. Rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized the seriousness of the event. When testifying on the Ludlow Massacre, and asked what action he would have taken as Director, John D. Rockefeller stated, \\"I would have taken no action.

For example, the units digit of 1234 is 4. The units digits of powers repeat after a certain period, and the period depends on what is being raised to a power (the base) and what power it's being raised to. In this case, we are raising 3 to an exponent that ends in 3 (33). If you look at powers of 3 modulo 10 (i.e., taking only the last digit), you see that they follow this pattern: 3^1 =3, 3^2=9, 3^3=7,3^4=1... So we have a repeating cycle here: 1,3,7 and 9. Therefore our answer will be one of 1 ,3 , 7 or 9 . We can ignore any other numbers in between because they don't affect the final sum when taken modulo 10 . To find out which term in this cycle corresponds to 43 , we use modular arithmetic as follows: 33 \\\\\\\\equiv 7\\\\\\\\mod{10} \\\\nSince 43-1 = 42 \\\\\\\\equiv 2\\\\\\\\mod{4}, therefore by chinese remainder theorem 33^{43} \\\\\\\\equiv 7^{2} \\\\\\\\equiv 49\\\\\\\\mod{10}. Now consider 53^{33}. Since 53 has 5 as its unit digit thus repeating cycle for 53 will be : 5 , 25 , 75 , 125 . It can be shown that 125 has 1 as its unit digit by using fermat's little theorem i.e., if p is prime then ap-a  ≡ 0 mod p =>125 -5 ≡ 0 mod 5 => 120/5 ≡ 0 i.e 120 = 24*5 => 24 = 22+2 so by fermat's little theorem 125 ≡ 52+25 ≡ 25(mod\\\\(p)) where \\\\(p\\\\)is prime i..e \\\\(p\\\\)=5 Therefore our repeating cycle for 53 will be : 5 25 75 1 Now considering 33 again using modular arithmetic we get :53^{33}   \\\\\\\\equiv  75\\\\\\\\mod{10}. So if n=(33)43+(53)33 then n=(75)+49-(75)-49 which implies n=(49)+(-49)=0 so units_digit(n)=0"},{"source":"Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.\\n\\nAbstract: In an institution for the mentally retarded, a total of 13 (2.4%) susceptible employees seroconverted for hepatitis B during 539 person-years.

This capacity was reportedly specified by Sony executive Norio Ohga in May 1980 so as to be able to contain the entirety of the London Philharmonic Orchestra's recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on one disc. This is a myth according to Kees Immink, as the code format had not yet been decided in May 1980. The adoption of EFM one month later would have allowed a playing time of 97 minutes for 120 mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100 mm. The 120 mm diameter has been adopted by subsequent formats, including Super Audio CD, DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc. Eighty-millimeter discs (\\"Mini CDs\\") were originally designed for CD singles and can hold up to 24 minutes of music or 210 MiB of data but never became popular.[citation needed] Today, nearly every single is released on a 120 mm CD, called a Maxi single.[citation needed];\\nQuestion: Why are CDs limited to one size?;\\nAnswer:","target":"Answer not in context","rationale":"The context only states that there are two sizes for the standard CDs.

Passage 1:When the Qajars had succeeded in restoring the unity of Persia, the sons of the Khan were no more able to maintain their independence like the other Caucasian chiefs and had to choose between Russia and Persia. The Khan of Shirwan, Mustafa, who had already entered into negotiations with Zubov, submitted to the Russians in 1805, who occupied the Persian cities of Derbend and Baku the next year (1806) during the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813), but soon afterwards he made overtures to the Persians and sought help from them. By the Treaty of Gulistan (12/24 October 1813) following the end of the 1804-1813 war, Persia was forced to cede its territories and regions comprising Darband, Quba, Shirwan and Baku, while giving up all claims on them as well. Nevertheless, Mustafa continued to have secret dealings with Persia. It was not until 1820 that his territory was occupied by Russian troops; the Khan fled to Persia and Shemakha was irrevocably incorporated in Russian territory. Iranian anger while being dissatisfied with losing swaths of its integral territories in the North and South Caucasus subsequently sparked the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), which resulted in another Iranian loss, as well as the ceding of its last remaining territories in the Caucasus comprising what is now Armenia, and southern parts of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan. The Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828 officially ratified the forced ceding of these Iranian territories to Imperial Russia, while it would also mark the official end of millennia long intertwined Iranian hegemony, rule, and influence over the Caucasus region, including Shirvan.\\n Passage 2:Neugebauer was active in infrared astronomy, and played a leading role in infrared studies of the planets. In addition—and largely through his activities with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC)—he led both ground- and space-based infrared studies of the stars, the Milky Way and other galaxies. Observations by him and his colleagues at Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories revealed thousands of infrared sources in the sky, and afforded the first infrared view of the galactic center. Together with Robert B. Leighton, he completed the Two-Micron Sky Survey, the first infrared survey of the sky, which cataloged more than 5,000 infrared sources. Together with Eric Becklin, he discovered the Becklin–Neugebauer Object, an intense source of infrared radiation in the Orion Nebula that is one of the brightest objects in the sky at wavelengths less than 10 micrometres.\\n Passage 3:Taube was born in New York City in 1939 to Count Arvid E.

He began working at the National Institute of Mental Health in 1961 as a statistician, and continued to work there until 1987, eventually becoming director of their Division of Biometry and Applied Sciences. He also began a mental health economics program at the NIMH and started their \\"Mental Health, United States\\" series, a regularly published report cataloging mental health statistics in the United States.

Born in Detroit, Michigan, and a graduate of Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School, Carson has authored numerous books on his medical career and political stances.\\nContext: On March 11, 2016, a week after Carson ended his presidential campaign, he endorsed Trump, calling him part of \\"the voice of the people to be heard.\\" Carson's subsequent comments that Americans would only have to sustain Trump for four years if he was not a good president drew criticism and he admitted that he would have preferred another candidate though thought Trump had the best chance of winning the general election. On the other hand, at the press conference Carson stated that Trump had a \\"cerebral\\" side.  On April 16, Carson spoke favorably of the possibility of abolishing the Electoral College, believing it disregards \\"the will of the people\\". Later that month, on April 25, Carson expressed opposition to Harriet Tubman replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, the day after dubbing the replacement \\"political expediency\\", though he indicated interest in Tubman having another tribute. In late April, Carson wrote to the Nevada Republican Party, requesting the two delegates he won in Nevada be released and free to support whoever they want.  On May 4, after Trump wrapped up the Republican nomination, he hinted that Carson would be among those who would vet his vice-presidential pick. The same day, Carson in an interview expressed interest in Ted Cruz serving as Attorney General of the United States, a position that Carson said would allow Cruz to prosecute Hillary Clinton, and then as a Supreme Court Justice nominee from the Trump administration. On May 6, Carson said in interview that Trump would consider a Democrat as his running mate, conflicting with Trump's asserting that he would not. A Carson spokesperson later said Carson expected Trump to select a Republican. Carson was said by aide Armstrong Williams in a May 10 interview to have withdrawn from the Trump campaign's vetting team, though the campaign confirmed he was still involved.

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\".\\nBorn in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892.\\nFrom the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall.\\nWood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force.

That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word, incorrigible. This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or \\"thisness\\" – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction.

On the first series of the game, the Jets drove to the Patriots' 13-yard line but the game remained scoreless after kicker Jay Feely missed a 31-yard field goal. Eleven plays later, the Patriots faced 3rd-and-goal from the Jets' 2-yard line, but a run for a loss by running back Laurence Maroney set up a 21-yard Gostkowski field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. After a Jets punt, the Patriots extended their lead to 6-0 on a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal early in the second quarter. The Jets responded with a 77-yard drive, highlighted by a 54-yard Laveranues Coles completion from quarterback Brett Favre, which brought them as close to the end zone as the Patriots' 1-yard line, but they again had to settle for a field goal; this time Feely completed the 21-yard attempt to cut the Patriots' lead to 6-3. The Patriots and Jets exchanged punts to end the first half. After a Patriots punt began the second half, the Jets started their next possession from their own 23-yard line. Three offensive penalties later, with the Jets at 2nd-and-25, defensive back Brandon Meriweather earned his first career interception on an errant Favre pass, giving the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 31-yard line. Despite a Kris Jenkins sack of Cassel to begin the drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 22-yard completion to running back Kevin Faulk on a 3rd-and-9 play. Three plays later, Morris ran it in from the Jets' 1-yard-line for a touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 13-3. On an ensuing Jets punt, a 24-yard Faulk return set up the Patriots' next drive at the Jets' 39-yard line; nine plays later, a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 16-3 lead and ended the third-quarter scoring. Beginning from their own 20-yard line for the sixth time in the game, the Jets drove into the Patriots' red zone and then cut the Patriots' lead to 16-10 on a 2-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. The Patriots' next drive went for 71 yards and ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal to build the Patriots' lead to 19-10. This would be the final score, as the Jets' next drive, which included a 20-yard sack of Favre by Adalius Thomas, went three-and-out and the Patriots held the ball for the final 3:45 in the game.

Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species.\\n\\nHint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...","target":"Bobby","rationale":"Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals.

We tested the role of endogenous ET-1 in the regulation of ANP release by passive immunization in anesthetized rats.', 'Intravenous injection of antiserum against ET-1 was shown to decrease basal and volume-stimulated plasma concentrations of ANP, whereas control serum was without effect. Antiserum generated in rabbits cross-reacted 100% with endothelin-2 and -3. In pentobarbital-anesthetized Wistar rats treated with ET-1 antiserum, plasma ANP concentration measured by radioimmunoassay was reduced by 37% from starting level after 10 minutes and by 30% after 60 minutes. Control rat serum had no effect on plasma ANP.

We dated semi-casually/semi-seriously when I was 16 and he was 19 for about a year. \\n\\nI describe it this way because we were teenagers, only communicated through texts (infrequently), saw each other maybe once a month (he joined the military shortly after we started talking), and did not have very much in common other than mutual attraction. However, we were “official” and did exchange ‘I love yous’ and talk jokingly but hopefully about having a future together. \\n\\nHe found out I was planning to cheat on him after he went through my phone and saw that I was also talking to other guys (I never was physically with anyone but I might have been had he not called me out on it and it’s still cheating regardless). When he confronted me, I lied about it, and we broke up right then and there but still continued to date on and off for about another year before we officially called it quits. \\n\\nI’m not excusing my behavior but I came from a really messed up background — I was in and out of foster care and was severely abused both at home and in the system. Because of this, I was also pretty messed up. I lied about little and big things, stole food and clothing, cheated on people and in school, manipulated others for my own gain, abused drugs and alcohol, was very promiscuous, and all around did not give a fuck about anyone other than myself and my 3 sisters. I was desperate to be loved but not trusting enough to ever give anyone the opportunity, so in order to protect myself and keep my options open because since that’s all I ever learned how to do, I was rarely faithful in my relationships. I was also a bitch about a lot of things but was still pretty submissive and doting in other ways, so I’m sure it was a confusing whirlwind for anyone I was involved with. All in all, I wasn’t the best person, let alone friend or girlfriend. \\n\\nI feel incredibly guilty about who I was back then and what I did to others. I have worked very hard in my adult life to never be that person again through lots of intensive therapy, medication, getting an education, and choosing to be better and do good each day. I can never take back the hurt I caused others but I have centered my life around making up for my transgressions through other means. I own and operate a non-profit that houses and fully sponsors homeless teens and young adults who have aged out of the system to receive counseling and work towards their future goals, whether that be college or entering the work force. This information is probably meaningless for the purpose of this but I feel as if it’s important to know that my behavior was circumstantial and it is not who I am.  \\n\\nMy ex and I still talk, we grew up together so he knows my situation, and I have apologized profusely to him over the years. He calls me up crying about once or twice every single year to tell me how I’ve ruined his ability to trust and love others and how hurt he still is. Sometimes he hits me up and is very flirtatious and tries to spark things up again (I always turn these advances down). Other times, if I’m dating someone and he knows who they are, he will antagonize them, insult them, and has, on occasion, gotten physical with them. I never severed ties with him because I always felt like he was justified in his treatment towards me and his resulting behavior because of how I wronged him, because I thought he was amazing and I felt like I was beneath him, and I felt so guilty for messing up such a good thing with a good guy that part of me hoped we’d get back together. \\n\\nRecently, about a few weeks ago, we were catching up and he started bragging to me about all these things he’s doing (he is very accomplished, has his PhD and has won a lot of awards, and is such an upstanding, good person, he adopted his cousin’s twin boys because the cousin is strung out on heroin, so he kind of deserves to brag and be complimented for all he’s done) but I thought it was strange because we hadn’t spoken in length for years. Then he started bragging about how he hadn’t dated anyone since we had been together, something he does often, even though this is a lie as I know at least three people he has seen and two he has been “official” with. He again blamed me for his unwillingness and inability to get involved with others and started saying straight up bullshit about the times we were together (saying we dated at a different time than we did by several years, saying we were never official and only talked for one month, etc). Then he started coming on to me, demanded I start sending him nudes regularly, and that we be fuck buddies. \\n\\nAt this point, I just lost it. I started yelling about how he can’t change the facts of things just because he doesn’t like how they turned out, how rude it is of him to always try to use me for sex (something he has admitted to in the past), that it’s not fair he pops back into my life to punish me every few months and that I was done with it, that I had always felt sorry about how I treated him before now but that I wasn’t sorry anymore because he’s acting creepy and pathetic, that it had been over 10 years since all this happened and he should have been over it by now and that not dating anyone in your twenties doesn’t make you some saint like he’s always painting himself out to be, I told him he needs to stop blaming me for his intimacy issues and stop using me to make himself feel good, that he is being ridiculous and that even though he thinks I’m the horrible person it’s really him, and that he needed professional help. I did say I wish I had never hurt him or anyone else but that I was a teenager, raising myself and living in constant fear, and that no one should be judged based off of who they were as teenagers and that he of all people should know that (he also did some very messed up things as a teenager which I won’t elaborate on as it’s not pertinent to this). \\n\\nHe got really pissed off and started cussing me out and saying that I was a good for nothing whore and that I would never be anything more, that everyone knew what a slut I was and that that no one actually liked me, that I can’t call him out on acting like a shitty person because I am the actual truly shitty person, that I don’t deserve to be happy or loved, that I was an idiot, that he wasn’t immature but that I was for raising my voice and always using slang words (I work with teenagers, it rubs off, what can I say), that I would never be as accomplished him and would never amount to anything, and that he was the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me. \\n\\nI rolled my eyes and laughed at him and get kind of snarky and told him I don’t owe him anything, that it was gracious of me to apologize as much as I had but that I didn’t have to but did because I wanted him to know it was me and not him, and that even if I did owe him something it most certainly wouldn’t be my body and that he’s raising his cousin’s boys badly if he believes that. \\n\\nHe said that since I just put out for everyone and since he’s already seen it all then I shouldn’t be such a bitch about us hooking up or sending him nudes and that it’s offensive to him that I’m shutting him down. \\n\\nI hold him that the only reason he was mad was because I was supposedly a whore but that I wouldn’t be a whore for him. \\n\\nHe stormed off after this and then blocked me on all social media a few minutes later. We haven’t talked or seen each other since. \\n\\nI don’t really feel bad about cheating on him anymore or about how he’s dealt with that (I still know it was wrong). My opinion of him has completely flipped from placing him on a pedestal to thinking lower of him and believing he’s just an egotistical jerk who’s got everyone else fooled (we’re from a small town and he’s very popular here, everyone loves him and thinks he is literally the world’s greatest person, and everyone he meets outside of our town think the same thing). \\n\\nA couple days after we fought, I started to feel like I am actually in the wrong for being mad at him, fussing at him, and for having stopped feeling bad, and for starting to feel kind of repulsed by him. I know that everything impacts each person differently and I don’t want to invalidate his feelings or belittle them and I know that everyone moves on or doesn’t at their own pace and own prerogative and it’s not my position to say how or when someone does or doesn’t do this. I know that even though I might have seen our relationship as silly and was not really invested in it or him, he may have been very committed and in love and I could have crushed him, so just because I feel one way doesn’t mean he will feel the same way, and I can’t project that into him. \\n\\nBut truth be told, and to be quite blunt about it, I truly just feel like he’s being a little bitch about it and that he has now wronged me so we’re even somehow. \\n\\nI don’t really know how to feel about how I’m feeling and keep switching between feeling like I crossed the line and will never be in the right when it comes to him because of our history OR feeling relieved, vindicated, and very appalled at and vexed by him. \\n\\nI’m just here looking for some unbiased clarification as of course my friends support my side of it just as I’m sure his friends support his. \\n\\nSo reddit, AITA?","target":"WRONG","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning if it was appropriate to be repulsed by their ex-boyfriend and get mad at him for not getting over an event that occurred 10 years ago.\\\\nIn the post, the author uses the past tense to describe the events, but they do not explicitly state when they occurred.

She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by Tintoretto and Titian which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a male gaze), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer. Writing in \\"The Crying Face\\", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a \\"pictorial formula for crying\\".\\nBy the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a psalter or book of hours in the privacy of their homes. Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news—a witness—and hence directly associated with the text.The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance.  Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer.

Americans often use it to express heat. When they are red-hot, they are very angry about something. Fast loud music is popular with many people. They may say such music is red-hot.\\nPink is a lighter kind of red. People sometimes say they are in the pink when they are in good health. The expression was first used in America at the beginning of the 20thcentury. It probably comes from the fact that many babies are born with a nice pink color that shows that they are in good health.\\nBlue is a cool color. The blues music in the United States is the opposite of red-hot music. Blues is slow and sad. Someone who is blue is very sad.\\nThe color green is natural for trees and grass. But it is an unnatural color for humans. A person who has a sick feeling in the stomach may say he feels a little green. A passenger on a boat who is feeling very sick from high waves may look very green. Sometimes a person may be _ because he does not have something as nice as a friend has, like a fast new car. That person may say he is green with envy. Some people are green with envy because a friend has more dollars or greenbacks.

For moments of bad luck, Hungarians still say: \\"more was lost at Mohács\\" . Hungarians view Mohács as marking the end of an independent and powerful European nation. Whilst Mohács was a decisive loss, it was the aftermath that truly put an end to independent Hungary. The ensuing two hundred years of near constant warfare between the two empires, Habsburg and Ottoman, turned Hungary into a perpetual battlefield. The countryside was regularly ravaged by armies moving back and forth, in turn devastating the population. Only in the 19th century would Hungary regain some degree of autonomy, with full independence coming only after the First World War; however, the Treaty of Trianon awarded much of its former land to other states , and Hungary has never regained its former political power. In the 464 years from 1525 to 1989, Hungary spent the vast majority of the time under the direct or indirect domination of a foreign power. These foreign powers were, successively, the Ottoman Empire , the Holy Roman Empire , the Austrian Empire , and the Soviet Union ; furthermore, between 1867 and 1918 Hungary was widely considered the \\"junior\\" partner in the Austro-Hungarian Empire: autonomy was granted, but stopped well short of independence. The battlefield, beside the village of Sátorhely, became an official national historical memorial site in 1976 on the 450th anniversary of the battle.

J. Anderson. A 22-yard field goal by placekicker Connor Barth increased the Broncos' lead to 17-0 early in the second quarter. The scoring play occurred after the Broncos' special teams fooled the Chiefs with a fake punt run by safety David Bruton and a fourth-down conversion by Anderson. The Chiefs got on the scoreboard later in the second quarter, with quarterback Alex Smith connecting on a 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Anthony Fasano.

The Chiefs' defense forced a fumble off Manning deep in Broncos' territory on the Broncos' first possession of the second half, but had to settle on a 39-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos.

The first field goal came after a DeMarcus Ware interception of Smith on a deflected pass, while the second field goal came after Chiefs' cornerback Marcus Cooper muffed a punt. The Chiefs narrowed the Broncos' lead, with Smith throwing a 12-yard touchdown pass to running back Jamaal Charles. However, Broncos' safety T. J. Ward knocked away a two-point conversion pass from Smith intended for Fasano that would have brought the Chiefs to within a one-score deficit. Barth added one more field goal &#8212; a 37-yarder midway through the fourth quarter. The Broncos' defense subdued the Chiefs for the remainder of the game.

Much of the disagreement is without doubt based on lack of a uniformly accepted model of acute airway obstruction representative of the clinical event. A variety of models have been used to assess different aspects of airway obstruction by foreign bodies. These models have analyzed, among other variables, kinetic energy and inertial and aerodynamic forces in attempts to focus on specific aspects of this controversy. Human volunteers, anesthetized and paralyzed patients, and cadavers have also been used. In several recent studies it was concluded that subdiaphragmatic pressure is the treatment of choice, while in at least one additional study firm back blows applied with the patient's head hanging downward were recommended as the treatment most likely to relieve airway obstruction. It seems likely that these apparently conflicting views can be reconciled and that a consensus recommendation for treatment of this emergency can be effected. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Foreign body airway obstruction: considerations in 1985. option2: IgM antibodies recognizing carbohydrate epitopes shared between schistosomula and miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni that block in vitro killing.","target":"Foreign body airway obstruction: considerations in 1985","rationale":"The abstract introduces a controversy about the management of foreign body airway obstruction, which is an emergency medical issue.

In societies where social roles are strictly determined, boys pattern their play after the activities of their fathers and girls after the tasks of their mothers. This is true because boys and girls are being prepared, even in play, to step into the roles and responsibilities of the adult world. \\nWhat is remarkable about the history of toys is not so much how they changed over the centuries but how much they have remained the same. It is the universality of toys about their development in all parts of the world and their continuing to the present that is amazing. In Egypt, the Americas, China, Japan and among the Arctic peoples, generally the same kinds of toys appeared. Nearly every civilization had dolls, little weapons, toy soldiers, tiny animals and vehicles. \\nBecause toys can be generally regarded as a kind of art form, they have not been subject to   technological progress that characterizes inventions for adult use.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods.

In development of the system, emphasis was placed on providing an anesthesiologist-computer interface that can be adapted to typical situations during anesthesia and to individual user behavior. One main feature of this interface is the integration of the input and output of information. The only device for interaction between the anesthesiologist and the AIS is a touch-sensitive, high-resolution color display screen. The anesthesiologist enters information by touching virtual function keys displayed on the screen. A data window displays all data generated over time, such as automatically recorded vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and rectal and esophageal temperatures, and manually entered variables, such as administered drugs, and ventilator settings. The information gathered by the AIS is presented on the cathode ray tube in several pages. A main distributor page gives an overall view of the content of every work page. A one-page record of the anesthesia is automatically plotted on a multicolor digital plotter during the operation. An example of the use of the AIS is presented from a field test of the system during which it was evaluated in the operating room without interfering with the ongoing operation. Medical staff who used the AIS imitated the anesthesiologist's recording and information search behavior but did not have responsibility for the conduct of the anesthetic. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: An anesthesia information system for monitoring and record keeping during surgical anesthesia. option2: Nitrous oxide: clinical and electrophysiologic investigation of neurologic complications.","target":"An anesthesia information system for monitoring and record keeping during surgical anesthesia","rationale":"The abstract describes the development of an anesthesia information system that supports monitoring and recording during surgical operations.

However, both the Lake Rose and Lake Leigh dams were \\"poorly constructed\\" and could not be used to generate power; both dams were condemned by the state and Lake Rose was drained in 1969.

In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\".

The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family.\\n\\n- A century ( from the Latin centum , meaning one hundred ; abbreviated c. ) is 100 years . Centuries are numbered ordinally in English and many other languages ( e.g. \`\` the 7th century AD / CE '' ) .

The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet.\\n\\n- Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

In common usage, it is either an interval equal to 24 hours or daytime, the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon. The period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun is called a \\"solar day\\". Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience. In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth, and was designated the SI base unit of time. The unit of measurement \\"day\\", redefined in 1960 as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized \\"d\\", is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI. A civil day is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. The word \\"day\\" may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \\"On which day?\\" The life patterns of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle (see circadian rhythms).\\n\\n- The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants.

Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.\\n\\n- A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by changes in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the globe, four seasons are generally recognized: \\"spring\\", \\"summer\\", \\"autumn\\" and \\"winter\\".

Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the 'home grown' rule to be enacted, whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players'.

If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs","target":"trial four","rationale":"In the given trial, Greg made coffee in both cold and hot water.

Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for \\"industrial fluctuations\\" based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that \\"the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process\\".\\n\\nTitle:","target":"Friedrich Hayek","rationale":"From the given context, we can understand that Friedrich Hayek was an economist.

He served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution. As a driving force behind the nation's establishment he came to be known as the \\"father of the country,\\" both during his lifetime and to this day. Washington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he inherited.\\n\\nGeorge Washington was the first child of Augustine Washington and his second wife Mary Ball Washington, born on their Popes Creek Estate near Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was born on February 11, 1731, according to the Julian calendar and Annunciation Style of enumerating years then in use in the British Empire. The Gregorian calendar was adopted within the British Empire in 1752, and it renders a birth date of February 22, 1732.  Washington was of primarily English gentry descent, especially from Sulgrave, England. His great-grandfather John Washington immigrated to Virginia in 1656 and began accumulating land and slaves, as did his son Lawrence and his grandson, George's father Augustine. Augustine was a tobacco planter who also tried his hand at iron manufacturing, and later he was the Justice of the Westmoreland County Court. In Washington's youth, his family was moderately prosperous and considered members of Virginia's \\"country level gentry\\" of \\"middling rank,\\" rather than one of the leading wealthy planter elite families. His wife Sally was also a friend of Washington and an early romantic interest, and maintained correspondence when she moved to England with her father, but most of the letters were intercepted by the British during the war.  Lawrence Washington inherited a plantation from their father on the Potomac River at Little Hunting Creek which he named Mount Vernon in honor of his commanding officer Vice Admiral Edward Vernon. Washington inherited Ferry Farm upon his father's death and eventually acquired Mount Vernon after Lawrence's death.  The death of his father prevented Washington from an education at England's Appleby Grammar School such as his older brothers had received. He achieved the equivalent of an elementary school education from a variety of tutors, as well as from a school run by an Anglican clergyman in or near Fredericksburg. His education totaled seven or eight years, while he lived with relatives at various places that included the Westmoreland and the Chotank regions of Virginia, as well as Ferry Farm and Mount Vernon. He was trained in mathematics, trigonometry, and surveying that developed a natural talent of draftsmanship and map making. He was also an avid reader and purchased books on military affairs, agriculture, and history, as well as the popular novels of his times. There was talk of securing an appointment for him in the Royal Navy when he was 15, but it was dropped when his widowed mother objected.  In 1751, Washington traveled with Lawrence to Barbados (his only trip abroad) in the hope that the climate would be beneficial to Lawrence's declining health, as he was suffering from tuberculosis. Washington contracted smallpox during the trip, which left his face slightly scarred but immunized him against future exposures to the disease. Lawrence's health failed to improve, and he returned to Mount Vernon where he died in the summer of 1752. His position as Adjutant General (militia leader) of Virginia was divided into four district offices after his death, and Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753, with the rank of major in the Virginia militia. He also became a freemason while in Fredericksburg during this period, although his involvement was minimal.\\n\\nWhen did he die?","target":"1752.","rationale":"The first sentence mentions that George Washington died in 1799. However, the second paragraph goes on to state that Lawrence's health failed and he returned home where he died in the summer of 1752. Since this portion is a bit more specific than the one above it (1752 vs 1799), we can conclude from context that there was some kind of mistake in the original answer - perhaps someone typed an extra 9 while they were typing out his death year?\\nTherefore, it makes sense to replace \\"December 14th, 1799\\" with \\"Summer of 1752\\", which would make for a valid question.\\""},{"source":"at Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, North Carolina The Falcons opened the regular season on the road against the Carolina Panthers on September 10.

It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman.

The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano:\\nI decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did.\\nDespite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".","target":"Monteux","rationale":"The context is discussing the conductor of Le sacre du printemps, which was originally performed in 1913. The name \\"Monteux\\" appears multiple times throughout this text and can be inferred to be the person conducting this piece since he had previously worked with both Debussy (in Jeux) and Stravinsky (the composer). There are two instances where Monteux mentions that he will conduct a new work by either Debussy or Stravinsky:\\n1) \\"[Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, 'This is a masterpiece, Monteux ... because you are going to conduct it.'\\"\\n2) \\"...

The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said. \\nWhat test must women undergo 34 hours before an abortion is performed where a doctor must give a verbal explanation of the results \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson\\"? \\nI was going to say \\"Monogram\\".

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes.

The yeast lineage originated hundreds of millions of years ago, and 1,500 species are currently identified. They are estimated to constitute 1% of all described fungal species. Yeasts are unicellular organisms which evolved from multicellular ancestors, with some species having the ability to develop multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae or false hyphae. Yeast sizes vary greatly, depending on species and environment, typically measuring 34 µm in diameter, although some yeasts can grow to 40 µm in size. Most yeasts reproduce asexually by mitosis, and many do so by the asymmetric division process known as budding.\\n\\n- Chlamydomonas is a genus of green algae consisting of unicellular flagellates, found in stagnant water and on damp soil, in freshwater, seawater, and even in snow as \\"snow algae\\" \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is used as a model organism for molecular biology, especially studies of flagellar motility and chloroplast dynamics, biogeneses, and genetics. One of the many striking features of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is that it contains ion channels, (channelrhodopsins), that are directly activated by light. Some regulatory systems of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" are more complex than their homologs in Gymnosperms, with evolutionarily related regulatory proteins being larger and containing additional domains.\\n\\n- A flagellate is a cell or organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. The word \\"flagellate\\" also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many protists (eukaryotic organisms) and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term \\"flagellate\\" is included in other terms (such as \\"dinoflagellate\\" and \\"choanoflagellata\\") which are more formally characterized.\\n\\n- The tetrad is the four spores of a yeast , other Ascomycota or Chlamydomonas produced after meiosis . After parent haploids mate , they produce diploids . Under appropriate environmental conditions , diploids sporulate and undergo meiosis . The meiotic products , spores , remain packaged in the parental cell body to produce the tetrad . If the two parents have a mutation in two different genes , the tetrad can segregate these genes as the parental ditype ( PD ) , the non-parental ditype ( NPD ) or as the tetratype ( TT ) .\\n\\n- Dikarya is a subkingdom of Fungi that includes the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, both of which in general produce dikaryons, may be filamentous or unicellular, but are always without flagella. The Dikarya are most of the so-called \\"higher fungi\\", but also include many anamorphic species that would have been classified as molds in historical literature. Phylogenetically the two phyla regularly group together. In a 1998 publication, Thomas Cavalier-Smith referred to this group as the Neomycota.\\n\\n- In geometry, a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle. Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere.

Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.\\n\\n- Ion channels are pore-forming membrane proteins whose functions include establishing a resting membrane potential, shaping action potentials and other electrical signals by gating the flow of ions across the cell membrane, controlling the flow of ions across secretory and epithelial cells, and regulating cell volume. Ion channels are present in the membranes of all cells. Ion channels are considered to be one of the two traditional classes of ionophoric proteins, with the other class known as ion transporters (including the sodium-potassium pump, sodium-calcium exchanger, and sodium-glucose transport proteins, amongst others).\\n\\n- In cell biology, mitosis is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell cyclethe division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other.\\n\\n- Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.\\n\\n- Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: (\\"askos\\"), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences.\\n\\n- Chloroplasts are organelles, specialized subunits, in plant and algal cells. Their discovery inside plant cells is usually credited to Julius von Sachs (18321897), an influential botanist and author of standard botanical textbooks  sometimes called \\"The Father of Plant Physiology\\".\\n\\n- Molecular biology concerns the molecular basis of biological activity between biomolecules in the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins and their biosynthesis, as well as the regulation of these interactions. Writing in \\"Nature\\" in 1961, William Astbury described molecular biology as:\\n\\n- In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'tetrad ' exhibits the relationship of 'field of work'.

Patients ingested a wireless video capsule, which was followed immediately by a nasogastric tube aspiration and later by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). We compared capsule endoscopy with nasogastric tube aspiration for determination of the presence of blood, and with EGD for discrimination of the source of bleeding, identification of peptic/inflammatory lesions, safety, and patient satisfaction.   \\n RESULTS The study enrolled 49 patients (32 men, 17 women; mean age 58.3 ± 19 years), but three patients did not complete the capsule endoscopy and five were intolerant of the nasogastric tube. Blood was detected in the upper gastrointestinal tract significantly more often by capsule endoscopy (15 /18 [83.3 %]) than by nasogastric tube aspiration (6 /18 [33.3 %]; P = 0.035). There was no significant difference in the identification of peptic/inflammatory lesions between capsule endoscopy (27 /40 [67.5 %]) and EGD (35 /40 [87.5 %]; P = 0.10, OR 0.39 95 %CI 0.11 - 1.15). Capsule endoscopy reached the duodenum in 45 /46 patients (98 %). One patient (2.2 %) had self-limited shortness of breath and one (2.2 %) had coughing on capsule ingestion.   \\n CONCLUSIONS In an emergency department setting, capsule endoscopy appears feasible and safe in people presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Capsule endoscopy identifies gross blood in the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the duodenum, significantly more often than nasogastric tube aspiration and identifies inflammatory lesions, as well as EGD.

The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian.\\n\\nOn September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times.  Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them.  On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\"  Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather's retirement was hastened by this incident.

Transcription arrest at the site of the lesion has been proposed as the first step for initiation of TCR. In support of this model, a strong correlation between arrest of transcription by a lesion in vitro and TCR of that lesion in vivo has been found in most cases analyzed. TCR has been reported for oxidative DNA damage; however, very little is known about how frequently occurring and spontaneous DNA damage, such as depurination and base deamination, affects progression of the transcription complex. We have previously determined that the oxidative lesion, thymine glycol, is a significant block to transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) but has no detectable effect on transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) in a reconstituted system with all of the required factors. Another oxidative lesion, 8-oxoguanine, only slightly blocked T7 RNAP and caused RNAP II to briefly pause at the lesion before bypassing it. Because an abasic site is an intermediate in the repair of oxidative damage, it was of interest to learn whether it arrested transcription. Using in vitro transcription assays and substrates containing a specifically positioned lesion, we found that an abasic site in the transcribed strand is a 60% block to transcription by T7 RNAP but nearly a complete block to transcription by mammalian RNAP II. An abasic site in the nontranscribed strand did not block either polymerase. Our results clearly indicate that an abasic site is a much stronger block to transcription than either a thymine glycol or an 8-oxoguanine. Because the predominant model for TCR postulates that only lesions that block RNAP will be subject to TCR, our findings suggest that the abasic site may be sufficient to initiate TCR in vivo. \\n Question: Which gene strand is targeted by transcription-coupled repair (TCR)?","target":"the transcribed strand","rationale":"The correct answer is \\"the transcribed strand\\" as the fifth sentence in the context states that \\"TCR has been reported for oxidative DNA damage; however, very little is known about how frequently occurring and spontaneous DNA damage, such as depurination and base deamination, affects progression of the transcription complex.

Although, especially since the 1960s, the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries.
