Under 100 words is a good title length.\\n\\nBackground: Drainage systems and its role in sanitation related outbreaks are evident but still occluded once it has been installed. This current review evaluates if drainage systems can cause infections and thus be of clinical concern. Method: A review of the literature was analyzed. Papers, guidelines, and quality management systems have been considered. Results: Adequate sanitation is fundamental and a prerequisite for safe life and productivity. In contrast, malfunctioning sanitation has been reported to cause outbreaks all over the world. In areas with no sanitation, diarrheal mortality is high and has been shown to decrease by 36% after interventions to improve sanitation. Often, infections are faeces associated and when present in wastewater and sewage sludge poses a high risk of infection upon exposure. Hence, there are working safety guidelines and in industries where infection reduction is essential strict quality assurance systems, i.e. HACCP (hazard analysis critical control points) and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) must be complied. Healthcare has recently taken interest in the HACCP system in their efforts to reduce healthcare associated infections as a response to increasing number of ineffective antibiotics and the threat of mortality rate like the pre-antibiotic era. The last few years have called for immediate action to contain the emergence of increasing resistant microorganisms. Resistance is obtained as a result of overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both healthcare and agriculture. Also, by the discharge of antibiotics from manufacturers, healthcare and society. One mechanism of development of novel resistant pathogens has been shown to be by effortless sharing of genetic mobile elements coding for resistance from microbes in the environment to human microbes. These pathogens have been sampled from the drainage systems. These were noticed owing to their possession of an unusual antibiotic resistance profile linking them to the outbreak. Often the cause of sanitation related outbreaks is due to inadequate sanitation and maintenance. However, in general these infections probably go unnoticed. Conclusion: Drainage systems and its maintenance, if neglected, could pose a threat in both community and healthcare causing infections as well as emergence of multi-resistant bacteria that could cause unpredictable clinical manifestations.","target":"Drainage systems, an occluded source of sanitation related outbreaks","rationale":"The title should provide an overview of the main idea presented in the abstract, which is that drainage systems can cause infections and be of clinical concern.

Chamberlain was of English ancestry, and could trace his family line back to twelfth century England, during the reign of King Stephen. He was the oldest of five children. It is said that he was his mother's favorite while his father was tough on him. He was very involved in his church, mostly singing in the choir. His mother encouraged him to become a preacher while his father wanted him to join the military, but he felt a reluctance towards both options. He suffered a speech impediment until shortly after graduating from Bowdoin College. He entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1848 with the help of a local tutor, professor William Hyde. Chamberlain learned to read Ancient Greek and Latin in order to pass the entrance exam. While at Bowdoin he met many people who would influence his life, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, the wife of Bowdoin professor Calvin Stowe. Chamberlain would often go to listen to her read passages from what would later become her celebrated novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. He also joined the Peucinian Society, a group of students with Federalist leanings. A member of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society and a brother of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, Chamberlain graduated in 1852.  He married Fanny Adams, cousin and adopted daughter of a local clergyman, in 1855, and they had five children, one of whom was born too prematurely to survive and two of whom died in infancy. Chamberlain studied for three additional years at Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine, returned to Bowdoin, and began a career in education as a professor of rhetoric. He eventually went on to teach every subject in the curriculum with the exception of science and mathematics. In 1861 he was appointed Professor of Modern Languages. He was fluent in nine languages other than English: Greek, Latin, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac.  Chamberlain's great-grandfathers were soldiers in the American Revolutionary War. One, Franklin Chamberlain, was a sergeant at the Siege of Yorktown. His grandfather, also named Joshua Chamberlain, was a colonel in the local militia during the War of 1812 and was court-martialed (but exonerated) for his part in the humiliating Battle of Hampden, which led to the sacking of Bangor and Brewer by British forces.

Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes.

During the week, Chris Henry had died, and to honor him, the team all wore the number 15 on their helmets. Chad Ochocinco paid tribute to his teammate by kneeling for a prayer after he scored a touchdown in the first quarter. The Chargers were the first to score, when Antonio Gates caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers. The Bengals answered back with a 26-yard field goal by Shayne Graham to make the score 7-3. In the second quarter, Chad Ochocinco caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer, and the Bengals took the lead, 10-7. Following the Bengals' touchdown, the Chargers also got a touchdown, to put the Chargers back on top, 14-10. Near the end of the first half, Shayne Graham kicked another field goal, this time from 25 yards, to make the score 14-13 at halftime. The Bengals could not manage to score in the 3rd quarter, while the Chargers got a touchdown and a field goal. The score was 24-13 at the end of the 3rd quarter. The Bengals finally managed to score in the 4th quarter when Laveranues Coles caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer. The Bengals went for a two-point conversion, and were successful, making the score 24-21. Later in the quarter, Shayne Graham kicked another field goal, tying the game at 24 points for each team. The Chargers were then able to reach field goal range, and Nate Kaeding kicked a long 52-yard field goal to win the game. Due to the Baltimore Ravens win over the Chicago Bears, The Bengals were unable to claim the AFC North Division title.\\nHow many total points were scored in the first quarter?","target":"10","rationale":"To solve the problem \\"how many total points were scored in the first quarter?\\", we need to check how many total points each team got. For The Chargers, it is mentioned that they got a 3-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers during the first quarter. Therefore their score is 7 because 6+1=7 (6: touchdown; 1: extra point). As for The Bengals, it is said that they answered back with a 26-yard field goal by Shayne Graham and Chad Ochocinco caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer. Thus their scores are 10 since 3(field goal)+7(touchdown)=10 (3: field goal; 7: extra point).

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator.

He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making.\\nTo borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold:\\n1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media.\\n2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are.\\n3. It’s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.\\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\\nQuestion: David believes that\\nOptions:\\n- Tim Ingold is a smart man\\n- Tim Ingold is not savvy\\n- not enough information\\n- Tim Ingold is stupid","target":"Tim Ingold is a smart man","rationale":"The passage states that David believes the subject of media and communication studies needs to change.

PWC closed after a few months and Kuroda resumed his training at the Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) dojo. He made his FMW debut as a fan favorite with Masato Tanaka by losing to Dark Ranger and Masaru Toi in a tag team match on October 15. Kuroda remained in the low card for many years in the company and was usually utilized in opening matches on the card and served as a enhancement talent against higher level opponents, winning against only lesser known talent. He was often paired with fellow newcomer Tanaka in mid-card matches during the early years of his career and often wrestled Tanaka, Koji Nakagawa and Gosaku Goshogawara. Kuroda's first main event match took place on November 26, 1994, when he teamed with Atsushi Onita, Katsutoshi Niiyama and Masato Tanaka to defeat Mr. Pogo, The Gladiator, Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya in a no ropes barbed wire street fight deathmatch. Kuroda would team with Onita, Niiyama and Tanaka in several street fights during late 1994 and early 1995. In the summer of 1995, Kuroda was entered into the Young Spirit Tournament, a round robin tournament consisting of rising rookies of the company. He would lose all of his matches in the tournament against W*ING Kanemura, Hideki Hosaka, Koji Nakagawa and Hido, while wrestling Masato Tanaka to a double knockout to gain one point in the tournament.\\n Link Information: He made his FMW debut as a fan favorite with Masato Tanaka by losing to Dark Ranger and Masaru Toi in a tag team match on October 15. Answer: Masato Tanaka","target":"Which of Kuroda's contemporaries had more championships, Hosaka or Tanaka?","rationale":"The question should use the information provided in both the passage and link information to obtain the given answer, which is 'Masato Tanaka'. The question \\"Which of Kuroda's contemporaries had more championships, Hosaka or Tanaka?\\" asks about Kuroda's contemporaries. In the link information, we know that FMW debut was made with Masato Tanaka. Also, in the passage we know that he lost against Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya in a no ropes barbed wire street fight deathmatch. Therefore, since Masato Tanaka was mentioned directly as Kuroda's contemporary in his FMW debut match alongside him and that he didn't lose against any other wrestler (other than himself), we can conclude that Masato Tanaka has more championships than Hosaka."},{"source":"Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.

On the negative side, Daniel Roche contests claims that Masonry promoted egalitarianism. He argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds.

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of.\\nWhile in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community.\\nIn my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more.

It first appeared in 1796 , in London in 4 volumes , and related the tale of Amanda and Oscar Fitzalan , two young people in love who are robbed of their rightful inheritance by a forged will . Her third novel , was a major commercial success , remaining in print for most of the 19th century , although its critical reception suffered from its original publication by the sensationalist Minerva Press . The Children of the Abbey was also mentioned in Jane Austen 's popular novel Emma and in Emily Climbs by L. M. Montgomery .\\n\\n- Regina Maria Roche (17641845) is considered today to be a minor Gothic novelist who wrote in the shadow of Ann Radcliffe. She was, however, a best seller in her own time. The popularity of her third novel, \\"The Children of the Abbey\\", rivaled that of Ann Radcliffes \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\".\\n\\n- Minerva Press was a publishing house, noted for creating a lucrative market in sentimental and Gothic fiction in the late 18th century and early 19th century. It was established by William Lane (1745?-1814) at No 33 Leadenhall Street, London, when he moved his circulating library there in about 1790.\\n\\n- The Mysteries of Udolpho, by Ann Radcliffe, was published in four volumes on 8 May 1794 by G. G. and J. Robinson of London. The firm paid her £500 for the manuscript. The contract is housed at the University of Virginia Library. Her fourth and most popular novel, \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" follows the fortunes of Emily St. Aubert, who suffers, among other misadventures, the death of her father, supernatural terrors in a gloomy castle and the machinations of an Italian brigand. Often cited as the archetypal Gothic novel, \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho,\\" along with Radcliffe's novel \\"The Romance of the Forest\\", plays a prominent role in Jane Austen's novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\", in which an impressionable young woman, after reading Radcliffe's novel, comes to see her friends and acquaintances as Gothic villains and victims with amusing results.\\n\\n- Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\".\\n\\n- Ann Radcliffe (née Ward, 9 July 1764  7 February 1823) was an English author and pioneer of the Gothic novel. Her style is Romantic in its vivid descriptions of landscapes and long travel scenes, yet the Gothic element is obvious through her use of the supernatural. It was her technique, \\"the explained supernatural\\" as the final revelation of inexplicable phenomena, which helped the Gothic novel achieve respectability in the 1790s.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'the children of the abbey' has the relation 'genre' with?","target":"gothic novel","rationale":"The rationale to choose \\"\\"gothic novel\\"\\" as the answer is:"},{"source":"Two analogies that signify affordances are given in the form \\"A : B.

Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.\\nTo create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s.

It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: A group of middle school students is measuring the temperature of various liquids for a chemistry lab using a mercury thermometer.

His freedom is limited in several ways. Firstly, by the things around him, such as wild animals or cliffs too steep   to climb. Secondly, by his own needs: he must have sleep, water, food and shelter from extreme heat or cold. Lastly, by his own nature as a man: disease may attack him, and death will certainly come to him sooner or later.\\nWhen men live together, on the other hand, protection against wild animals is easier and they can work together to get food and build shelters; but each man has to give up some of his freedom so that he can live happily with the others.\\nWhen men become organized into very large groups, and civilization   develops, it is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could if he were living alone; but such a society can not work successfully unless the freedom of each human being is to some extent limited so that he is kept from hurting others. I am not free to kill others, nor to steal someone else's property, nor to behave in a way that offends   against the moral sense of the society in which I live. I have to limit my own freedom myself so that others will not limit it too much: I agree to respect the rights of others, and in return they agree to respect mine.\\nThe advantages of such an agreement are great: one man can become a doctor, knowing that others will grow food, make clothes and build a house for him, in return for the work he does to keep them healthy. If each man had to grow his own food, make his own clothes, build his own house and learn to be his own doctor, he would find it impossible to do any one of these jobs really well. By working together, we make it possible for society to provide us all with food, clothes, shelter and medical care, while leaving each of us with as much freedom as it can.\\nQuestion: We may infer from the passage that the author    _   .\\nOptions: A: is against separation from a civilized society.\\nB: is in favor of a well-organized society.\\nC: is against freedom gained at others.\\nD: denies the existence of many-sided people","target":"B","rationale":"The author describes the limited freedom of a man living alone in nature, then says that when people begin to live together their individual freedoms are decreased but they can do more things and be happier. The author continues by describing how as groups grow larger into societies it becomes possible to get more freedom from hunger, thirst and other natural disadvantages; however this requires some sacrifice of personal liberty so that others will not limit your own too much. In conclusion the passage states that although each person must give up something for society's benefit it is worth it because everyone benefits tremendously: \\"one man can become a doctor\\" while others take care of everything else he needs.\\nSo we may infer from this passage that group organization improves life for everyone involved - therefore B is correct (as implied by the last sentence)."},{"source":"I gave my students this multiple choice question: An important rule for students to know when heating a test tube is to\\n\\nOnly one answer is correct among these 4 choices:\\n- place a cork in the mouth of the test tube.\\n- point the mouth of the test tube away from others.\\n- hold the test tube loosely with the fingertips.\\n- shake the test tube forcefully to keep contents mixed.\\n\\nCould you tell me which one is correct?","target":"point the mouth of the test tube away from others.","rationale":"The correct answer is \\"point the mouth of the test tube away from others.\\"\\nReason: When heating a test tube, it should be pointed away from others because chemicals heated in a closed container can explode."},{"source":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\\nArticle: James Joyce was an Irish novelist who revolutionized the methods of depicting characters and developing a plot in modern fiction. his astonishing way of constructing a novel, his frank portrayal(, )of human nature in his books, and his complete command of English have made him one of the outstanding influences on literature in the 20th century.

Tickets are relatively inexpensive, averaging about $29 in 2016, and also grant admission to the livestock show and fairgrounds. More than 43,000 season tickets are sold every year, with the remaining seats 30,000 seats available for individual-show sale. Members of the HLSR are given an opportunity to buy individual tickets before the general public.  RodeoHouston is run independently of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). It offers one of the largest prize purses in North America, over $2 million, but the winnings do not count towards the competitors' qualification for the PRCA National Finals Rodeo. RodeoHouston is an invitational, featuring 280 of the top professional cowboys. They compete in a playoff format, with the ultimate champion in each event earning $50,000. On the final evening, the rodeo hosts the Cinch SuperShootout. Champions from each of the top 10 rodeos in North America are invited to compete as teams in a subset of rodeo events. The finals and the SuperShoot are televised on Fox Sports.  After the professional rodeo concludes, children are given an opportunity to compete. Each evening, 30 high school students from across the state compete in the calf scramble. They are given the opportunity to chase down (on foot) and catch one of 15 calves, put a halter on them, and drag them back to the center of the stadium. Winners are given money to purchase their own heifer or steer to show the following year. Immediately following the calf scramble is mutton busting. Five- and six-year-olds wearing protective gear try to ride a sheep across a portion of the arena.

Greg owns a pet turtle, named Chompy, and Lucy owns a pet frog, an amphibian. They decide they need to meet outside of school sometime so they can share pets since they both like playing with different animals.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.\\n\\n- A multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments at a professional level. Multi-instrumentalists who play closely related instruments, a practice known as doubling are common in orchestra (e.g., flute players who double on piccolo and percussion players, who play snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, etc.), in jazz (e.g., saxophone players who double on clarinet or flute; or double bass players who also play electric bass); in music theatre pit orchestras (e.g., reed players who are required to play numerous reed instruments); and in other areas of classical music (e.g., church piano players are often expected to play the church's pipe organ or Hammond organ as well). Popular music composers and songwriters are often multi-instrumentalists. In pop and rock, it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be multi-instrumentalists on instruments that are not from the same family: it is common for pop and rock musicians to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording.\\n\\n- Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes.\\n\\n- A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". \\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n- Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: \\"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres  drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\\"\\n\\n- Baduizm is the debut album by American R&B and neo soul singer-songwriter Erykah Badu, released on February 11, 1997 by Kedar Records. After leaving university in order to concentrate on music full-time, Badu then began touring with her cousin, Robert \\"Free\\" Bradford, where she recorded a 19-song demo, \\"Country Cousins\\", which attracted the attention of Kedar Massenburg. He set Badu up to record a duet with D'Angelo, \\"Your Precious Love,\\" and eventually signed her to a record deal with Universal Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during January to October 1996 at Battery Studios in New York City, Sigma Sounds & Ivory Studios in Philadelphia, and Dallas Sound Lab in Dallas.\\n\\n- Erykah Abi Wright (born Erica Abi Wright; February 26, 1971), better known by her stage name Erykah Badu, is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, disc jockey, activist, and actress.

Her first album, \\"Baduizm\\", was released on February 11, 1997. It spawned three singles: \\"On & On\\", \\"Next Lifetime\\" and \\"Otherside of the Game\\". The album was certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\\nBadu's first live album, \\"Live\\", was released on November 18, 1997 and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.\\n\\n- Neo soul is a genre of popular music. The term was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.\\n\\n- Roy Ayers (born September 10, 1940) is an American funk, soul, and jazz composer and vibraphone player. Ayers began his career as a post-bop jazz artist, releasing several albums with Atlantic Records, before his tenure at Polydor Records beginning in the 1970s, during which he helped pioneer jazz-funk. He is a key figure in the acid jazz movement, which is a mixture of jazz into hip-hop and funk, and has been dubbed by many as \\"The Godfather of Neo Soul\\". He is most well known for his signature compositions \\"Everybody Loves The Sunshine\\" and \\"Searchin\\", and is also famous for having more sampled hits by rappers than any other artist.\\n\\n- William \\"Kedar\\" Massenburg is an American record producer and record label executive, who was the president of Motown Records from 1997 to 2004. Massenburg is best known for bringing Erykah Badu to fame. He trademarked the term \\"neo soul.\\"\\n\\n- Mama's Gun is the second studio album by American neo soul singer Erykah Badu. It was recorded between 1999 and 2000 at Electric Lady Studios in New York and released on November 21, 2000, by Motown Records. A neo soul album, \\"Mama's Gun\\" incorporates funk, soul, and jazz styles. It has confessional lyrics by Badu, which cover themes of insecurity, social issues and personal relationships. The album has been viewed by critics as a female companion to neo soul artist D'Angelo's second album \\"Voodoo\\" (2000), which features a similar musical style and direction. Critics have also noted that while \\"Baduizm\\" contained its share of cryptic lyricism, \\"Mama's Gun\\" is much more direct in its approach, and places the artist in a subjective position more than its predecessor.\\n\\n- Polydor is a British record label and company, that operates as part of Universal Music Group. It has a close relationship with Universal's Interscope Geffen A&M label, which distributes Polydor's releases in the United States. In turn, Polydor distributes Interscope releases in the United Kingdom. Polydor Records Ltd. was established in 1954 British subsidiary in London by German Deutsche Grammophon GmbH. It was renamed in 1972 to Polydor Ltd.\\n\\n- The vibraphone (also known as the vibraharp or simply the vibes) is a musical instrument in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion family.\\n\\n- Musical collective is a phrase used to describe a group of musicians who collaborate over time to perform, record or compose music.\\n\\n- \`\` Cleva '' is the third and final single from American singer Erykah Badu 's second studio album , Mama 's Gun ( 2000 ) .

The song peaked at number seventy - seven on the Hot R&B / Hip - Hop Songs chart . It includes Roy Ayers on vibraphone .\\n\\n- Jazz-funk is a subgenre of jazz music characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers. The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.\\n\\n- Yasiin Bey (born Dante Terrell Smith; December 11, 1973), best known by his stage name Mos Def, is an American hip hop recording artist, actor and activist from Brooklyn, New York City, New York. Best known for his music, Mos Def embarked on his hip hop career in 1994, alongside his siblings in the short-lived rap group Urban Thermo Dynamics (UTD), after which he appeared on albums by Da Bush Babees and De La Soul.

Also, in some inputs, there can be zero emotion; for that return 'None'.\\n\\nContext: A boy walked up to the ticket taker at the local circus. He asked if he could get in for free because he was poor. The ticket taker pitied the boy but couldn't do what he wanted. \\n Sentence: The boy began to dance for the people in line to earn money. \\n Character: Ticket taker","target":"sad","rationale":"The context describes the interaction between the boy and the ticket taker. The ticket taker feels sympathy towards the boy, but they also feel bad because they cannot let him in for free. However, in the sentence, it is not clear which emotion is expressed by whom (the boy or the ticket taker).\\\\nTo answer this question, we can assume that \\\\nthe context applies to both of them and read through both of their points of view. The kid does not seem to be sad about anything in particular because he has just danced for people to earn money. On the other hand, at this point in time, it seems that only one person thinks about how poor he is: namely himself (if we assume that he did not tell anyone around him why he was dancing). Therefore we can conclude that it is most likely his own poverty which makes him sad while performing his job as a dancer or while imagining how rich people go to circus shows without feeling any sadness because they have enough money. This leads us to conclude that only one person could be expressing sadness at this point: namely himself (the character given)."},{"source":"Write a question about the following article: Conspiracy plans to overthrow Ottoman rule in the northern region of Epirus were organized in the 1570s by local Greek nobles, Manthos Papagiannis and Panos Stolikos, Nevertheless revolutionary actions began after Papagiannis' death in 1596. Spanish conspirators, with instructions from Naples, led an action to spark revolt in southern Albania. They decided to invite archbishop Athanasius I of Ohrid in their plans. He was described as \\"discrete and intelligent\\". In the beginning, Athanasius was uninvolved, until the beginning of 1596 when he offered his cooperation to the Venetian official in Corfu. Athanasius sent a letter to the provveditore and captain of Corfu, Angelo Basadonna, in January 1596, about wanting to meet up and discuss \\"very important things\\". The two had a meeting on 26 January 1596, during which Athanasius spoke of the \\"miserable state of Christians\\" and asked for help for a general uprising. Rejected by Venice, he openly joined the Spanish conspirators, who contacted the Napolitan deputy about this. Athanasius sent his minister to Naples to ask for weapons and 2,000 soldiers from Spain, and to establish the whole plan of the uprising. The Napolitan vice-king sent one of his captains to oversee events and to get to know the real intents of the people. While the Napolitan captain was in Albania, the Himariotes south of Valona immediately rose up. The Himara revolt was part of a range of anti-Ottoman movements in the Western Balkans at the end of the 16th century during the Long Turkish War in areas that extended from Epirus up north to the area of Šibenik .\\n\\nQuestion about the article:","target":"How many different factions planned to overthrow Ottoman rule?","rationale":"Here's a question for the given article:\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: How many different factions planned to overthrow Ottoman rule?"},{"source":"In this task you are given a tweet that contains some form of irony.

However, optimizing RNNs is known to be harder compared to feed-forward neural networks. A number of techniques have been proposed in literature to address this problem. In this paper we propose a simple technique called fraternal dropout that takes advantage of dropout to achieve this goal. Specifically, we propose to train two identical copies of an RNN (that share parameters) with different dropout masks while minimizing the difference between their (pre-softmax) predictions. In this way our regularization encourages the representations of RNNs to be invariant to dropout mask, thus being robust. We show that our regularization term is upper bounded by the expectation-linear dropout objective which has been shown to address the gap due to the difference between the train and inference phases of dropout. We evaluate our model and achieve state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling tasks on two benchmark datasets - Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2. We also show that our approach leads to performance improvement by a significant margin in image captioning (Microsoft COCO) and semi-supervised (CIFAR-10) tasks.","target":"We propose to train two identical copies of an recurrent neural network (that share parameters) with different dropout masks while minimizing the difference between their (pre-softmax) predictions","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose to train two identical copies of an recurrent neural network (that share parameters) with different dropout masks while minimizing the difference between their (pre-softmax) predictions."},{"source":"Decide the language of that sentence.

Lithuania supported the uprising and the Knights threatened to invade. Poland announced its support for the Lithuanian cause and threatened to invade Prussia in return. As Prussian troops evacuated Samogitia, the Teutonic Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania on 6 August 1409. The Knights hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania separately and began by invading Greater Poland and Kuyavia, catching the Poles by surprise. The Knights burned the castle at Dobrin , captured Bobrowniki after a fourteen-day siege, conquered Bydgoszcz , and sacked several towns. The Poles organized counterattacks and recaptured Bydgoszcz. The Samogitians attacked Memel . However, neither side was ready for a full-scale war. Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, agreed to mediate the dispute. A truce was signed on 8 October 1409; it was set to expire on 24 June 1410. Both sides used this time for preparations for the battle, gathering the troops and engaging in diplomatic maneuvers. Both sides sent letters and envoys accusing each other of various wrongdoings and threats to Christendom. Wenceslaus, who received a gift of 60,000 florins from the Knights, declared that Samogitia rightfully belonged to the Knights and only Dobrzyń Land should be returned to Poland. The Knights also paid 300,000 ducats to Sigismund of Hungary, who had ambitions for the principality of Moldova, for his military assistance. Sigismund attempted to break the Polish-Lithuanian alliance by offering Vytautas a king's crown; Vytautas's acceptance of such a crown would violate the terms of the Ostrów Agreement and create Polish-Lithuanian discord.

Passage 1: 21 heads north from the Newark Airport Interchange with U.S. Route 1/9 and U.S. Route 22 in Newark near the Newark Liberty International Airport on the six-lane, divided McCarter Highway. This portion of Route 21 serves to connect Newark Liberty with downtown Newark. The route interchanges with Interstate 78 and then crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Greenville Running Track, Lehigh Line, and Passaic and Harsimus Line and then Amtrak's Northeast Corridor rail line on a viaduct, coming to an interchange with Broad Street that provides access to Route 27. The route continues north, paralleling the elevated Northeast Corridor tracks that lead up to Newark Penn Station, which serves Amtrak and NJ Transit trains. At the Emmet Street intersection, Route 21 becomes a four-lane, undivided road and intersects Murray Street, which provides access to the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark. This section of Route 21 through the southern part of Newark has a high accident rate due to the heavy concentration of businesses and traffic lights along this portion of road. The road widens to six lanes and the route intersects County Route 510 (Market Street) near Newark Penn Station and continues north into downtown Newark, splitting from the Northeast Corridor rail line. It crosses Raymond Boulevard and the route meets County Route 508 (Center Street), with which it forms a concurrency.\\n Passage 2:Many young people in Canada at this time, especially young women, were influenced by the 1960s counterculture and identified with Trudeau, an energetic nonconformist who was relatively young.

Trudeau had once sympathized with Marxists and had spent time in the democratic socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, and many of his fans were attracted to his culturally liberal stances (he legalized homosexuality and created more flexible divorce laws as Justice Minister under Lester B. Pearson). Trudeau was also admired for his laid-back attitude and his celebrity relationships; in that word's prevailing use at the time, describing a modern, \\"hip and happening person\\", he was often described as a swinger. A high point happened during Trudeau's election campaign in 1968 during the annual Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade in Montreal, when rioting Quebec separatists threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated. Rejecting the pleas of his aides that he take cover, Trudeau stayed in his seat, facing the rioters, without any sign of fear. The image of the politician showing such courage impressed the Canadian people, and he handily won the election the next day.\\n Passage 3:Kork fought in World War I on the Northwestern Front and the Western Front.

To investigate the possible role of these cells in multiple sclerosis, we used anti-2H4 antibody to characterize peripheral-blood lymphocyte subsets in 63 patients with multiple sclerosis that was progressive, stable, or acute (relapsing-remitting). Twenty-three of 37 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis had a selective decrease in the number and percentage of peripheral-blood T cells that induce suppressor cells (T4+2H4+ cells), whereas only 3 of 16 patients with stable disease and 2 of 10 patients in the midst of an acute attack had a significant decrease. These selective decreases of circulating T4+2H4+ cells occurred in only 1 of 34 patient controls with other neurologic diseases and in 2 of 50 healthy controls (P less than 0.0001 by Fisher's exact test). The absolute number of T4+2H4+ cells and the percentage of reactivity in the populations studied were 187 +/- 28 per cubic millimeter and 8.3 +/- 1 percent in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis; 353 +/- 60 per cubic millimeter and 14.5 +/- 2 percent in patients with stable disease; 368 +/- 72 and 14.6 +/- 2.1 percent in patients with acute disease; 402 +/- 64 and 15.6 +/- 2 percent in controls with other neurologic diseases; and 519 +/- 44 and 19.7 +/- 1 percent in healthy controls. Functional studies using a pokeweed mitogen-driven IgG assay demonstrated a correlation between decreased numbers of T4+2H4+ cells and increased production of IgG in vitro. Family studies showed that the 2H4 antigen was not part of an inherited polymorphic antigenic determinant.

For instance, to fool the discriminator, a generative adversarial network (GAN) exclusively trained to transform images of black-haired *men* to blond-haired *men* would need to change gender-related characteristics as well as hair color when given images of black-haired *women* as input. This is problematic, as often it is possible to obtain *a* pair of (source, target) distributions but then have a second source distribution where the target distribution is unknown. The computational challenge is that generative models are good at generation within the manifold of the data that they are trained on. However, generating new samples outside of the manifold or extrapolating \\"out-of-sample\\" is a much harder problem that has been less well studied. To address this, we introduce a technique called *neuron editing* that learns how neurons encode an edit for a particular transformation in a latent space. We use an autoencoder to decompose the variation within the dataset into activations of different neurons and generate transformed data by defining an editing transformation on those neurons. By performing the transformation in a latent trained space, we encode fairly complex and non-linear transformations to the data with much simpler distribution shifts to the neuron's activations. Our technique is general and works on a wide variety of data domains and applications. We first demonstrate it on image transformations and then move to our two main biological applications: removal of batch artifacts representing unwanted noise and modeling the effect of drug treatments to predict synergy between drugs.","target":"A method for learning a transformation between one pair of source/target datasets and applying it a separate source dataset for which there is no target dataset","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nA method for learning a transformation between one pair of source/target datasets and applying it a separate source dataset for which there is no target dataset."},{"source":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which Simpsons character made his debut in an episode about Homer getting an illegal cable hook-up?","target":"Troy McClure","rationale":"The character Troy McClure made his debut in the episode titled \\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment,\\" where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up."},{"source":"Given a sentence, generate what should be the most likely next statement.

Anticipated advantages of this approach include a heightened barrier against the development of viral resistance and a broadened pathogen target spectrum. Myxoviruses are predominantly associated with acute disease and thus are particularly attractive for this approach since treatment time can be kept limited. To identify inhibitor candidates, we have analyzed hit compounds that emerged from a large-scale high-throughput screen for their ability to block replication of members of both the orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus families. This has returned a compound class with broad anti-viral activity including potent inhibition of different influenza virus and paramyxovirus strains. After hit-to-lead chemistry, inhibitory concentrations are in the nanomolar range in the context of immortalized cell lines and human PBMCs. The compound shows high metabolic stability when exposed to human S-9 hepatocyte subcellular fractions. Antiviral activity is host-cell species specific and most pronounced in cells of higher mammalian origin, supporting a host-cell target. While the compound induces a temporary cell cycle arrest, host mRNA and protein biosynthesis are largely unaffected and treated cells maintain full metabolic activity. Viral replication is blocked at a post-entry step and resembles the inhibition profile of a known inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) activity. Direct assessment of RdRp activity in the presence of the reagent reveals strong inhibition both in the context of viral infection and in reporter-based minireplicon assays. In toto, we have identified a compound class with broad viral target range that blocks host factors required for viral RdRp activity. Viral adaptation attempts did not induce resistance after prolonged exposure, in contrast to rapid adaptation to a pathogen-directed inhibitor of RdRp activity. \\n Title: Potent Host-Directed Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Myxovirus RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerases","target":"True","rationale":"The title includes the name of the compound and describes one of its main functions: \\"Inhibitors of Myxovirus RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerases\\".

Teleosts range from giant oarfish, measuring or more, and ocean sunfish weighing over , to the minute male anglerfish \\"Photocorynus spiniceps\\", just long.

With 17 species, many of which are threatened, it is the largest genus in the order Acipenseriformes.\\n\\n- Chondrostei are primarily cartilaginous fish showing some ossification . The 52 living species are divided among two orders , the Acipenseriformes ( sturgeons and paddlefishes ) , and the Polypteriformes ( reedfishes and bichirs ) . The ancestors of the chondrosteans are thought to be bony fish , but that this characteristic of an ossified skeleton was lost in later evolutionary development , resulting in a lightening of the frame . Elderly chondrostean individuals show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton , which suggests this process is delayed rather than wholly lost in these fishes . This group has at times been classified with the sharks : this because the chondrosteans , like the latter , mostly lack bone , and their structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than of other bony fish ; further , both groups lack scales ( excluding the Polypteriforms ) . Additional shared features include spiracles and , in sturgeons , a heterocercal tail ( the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin ) . However the fossil record suggests these fish have more characters in common with the Teleostei than their external appearance might suggest . Chondrostei is paraphyletic , meaning this subclass does not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor ; reclassification of the Chondrostei is therefore not out of the question . The name comes from Greek chondros meaning cartilage and osteo meaning bone .\\n\\n- Acipenseriformes is an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes the sturgeons and paddlefishes, as well as some extinct families.\\n\\n- Ossification (or osteogenesis) in bone remodeling is the process of laying down new bone material by cells called osteoblasts. It is synonymous with bone tissue formation. There are two processes resulting in the formation of normal, healthy bone tissue: Intramembranous ossification is the direct laying down of bone into the primitive connective tissue (mesenchyme), while endochondral ossification involves cartilage as a precursor. \\nIn fracture healing, endochondral osteogenesis is the most commonly occurring process, for example in fractures of long bones treated by plaster of Paris, whereas fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation with metal plates, screws, pins, rods and nails may heal by intramembranous osteogenesis.\\n\\n- Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. \\nSturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.","target":"chondrostei , actinopterygii","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"chondrostei , actinopterygii\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you need to answer basic science questions.

With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles.\\nLaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village.

The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest.

Unfortunately my first loaf reminded me of the total flops I used to make before reading through BBA and using its recipes. It was like a bread brick. I ended up deciding that croutons were the only suitable use. Since then I've made more recipes from the book, but always using his \\"transitional\\" variant of half bread flour, half wheat flour. These have risen and proofed perfectly.The technique from Whole Grain Breads involves pre-doughs. Flour, a very small amount of yeast, and water make up one dough ball that is placed in the refrigerator overnight. More flour, salt, and water are left as another dough ball on the counter overnight. Both enzyme activity and the rise in the fridge contribute to the texture and taste of the resulting bread, at least as far as I understand the theory. The next day the final dough is formed, allowed to rise once and proof once, and bake.With my first loaf I attempted a free-standing boule. I know that surface tension is critical to getting a boule to rise up and not out, but I am pretty sure that my surface tension on the boule was correct. For the transitional loaves since I've used a loaf pan and a sandwich shape, which may have helped them to rise. I've also done transitional pitas which seemed to puff up just fine during rising, even during proofing as small boules before rolling out.I don't want to try the 100% whole grain recipe again without knowing that it will work. I know that some bakers add vital wheat gluten to 100% whole grain recipes to ensure that they rise, but it seems like Reinhart's recipes should work without the additional gluten.

The analysis is carried out by using x-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Vickers micro hardness tester to investigate surface properties of the treated samples. Air is typically about 1% Argon with no ill effects, and no trapping in the lungs. The molecular weight of N 2 is about 28, O 2 about 32, and Argon about 40. They are close enough that they will mix, even in the lungs. Why is inhaling argon a bad idea? « Reply #4 on: 02/11/2011 19:54:08 » It is safe to breath argon in the atmosphere because it is thoroughly dissolved in the rest of the air, lowering it's density. Argon is also used in technical SCUBA diving to inflate the drysuit, due to its nonreactive, heat isolating effect. Argon as the gap between the panes of glass provides better insulation because it is a poorer conductor of heat than ordinary air. The most exotic use of argon is in the tyre of luxury cars.

The destroyer escort conducted operations along the east coast of North America until May 1958 when she sailed across the Atlantic for a cruise with the 6th Fleet. While operating with other ships of the 6th Fleet near Crete, she was ordered to the eastern end of the Mediterranean in mid-July to patrol off the Levantine coast.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower's personal representative Robert D. Murphy helped the factions to negotiate a settlement which resulted in the election of General Fuad Chehab to the presidency on 31 July. President Chamoun's refusal to yield office before the expiration of his term kept the country in turmoil until late September. However, political conditions in Lebanon remained highly volatile, so American forces remained there until after General Chehab took office in September.

Human eosinophils (25-95% purity) were obtained from donors with a variety of diseases associated with hypereosinophilia. PAF-acether elicited directional locomotion of eosinophils, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, at concentrations from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M; lyso-PAF had minimal activity over the same dose range. Compared with PAF-acether, the eosinophil locomotory responsiveness of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), histamine, and the valyl- and alanyl-eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) tetrapeptides was negligible. Conversely, neutrophil responsiveness to PAF-acether (optimum 10(-6) M) was comparable in effect to LTB4 (optimum dose 10(-8) M). It was shown that PAF-acether elicited both chemotaxis and chemokinesis of eosinophils. Comparison of normal density and light density eosinophils revealed no qualitative difference in the response to PAF-acether and the other chemoattractants, although the light density cells seemed to demonstrate a greater degree of locomotion to PAF-acether and LTB4. Thus, PAF-acether appears to be a potent eosinophilotactic agent which may play a role in inflammatory reactions characterized by eosinophil infiltration.","target":"Platelet-activating factor.

No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.; \\n\\nQuestion: Who used cognitive science to learn how dogs understand comics? \\n\\nIs this question answerable?","target":"no","rationale":"The question is not answerable because the context does not provide any reason to believe that someone used cognitive science to learn how dogs understand comics."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a question and answer options for that question.

In his youth, he began playing piano with two of his cousins, Mickey Gilley (later a popular country music singer) and Jimmy Swaggart (later a popular television evangelist). His parents mortgaged their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, Carl McVoy (who later recorded with Bill Black's Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black juke joint across the tracks.\\n\\nLewis's turbulent personal life was hidden from the public until a May 1958 British tour where Ray Berry, a news agency reporter at London's Heathrow Airport (the only journalist present), learned about Lewis's third wife, Myra Gale Brown. She was Lewis's first cousin once removed and was only 13 years old at the time. (Brown, Lewis, and his management all insisted that she was 15.) Lewis was 22 years old. The publicity caused an uproar, and the tour was cancelled after only three concerts.  The scandal followed Lewis home to the United States; and, as a result, he was blacklisted from radio and almost vanished from the music scene. Lewis felt betrayed by numerous people who had been his supporters. Dick Clark dropped him from his shows. Lewis even felt that Sam Phillips had sold him out when the Sun Records boss released \\"The Return of Jerry Lee\\", a bogus \\"interview\\" spliced together by Jack Clement from excerpts of Lewis's songs that \\"answered\\" the interview questions, which made light of his marital and publicity problems. Only Alan Freed stayed true to Lewis, playing his records until Freed was removed from the air because of payola allegations.  Lewis was still under contract with Sun Records, and kept recording, regularly releasing singles. He had gone from $10,000 a night for concerts to $250 a night for engagements in beer joints and small clubs. At the time he had few friends whom he felt he could trust. It was only through Kay Martin, the president of Lewis's fan club, T. L. Meade (also known as Franz Douskey), an occasional Memphis musician and friend of Sam Phillips, and Gary Skala, that Lewis went back to record at Sun Records.  In 1960, Phillips opened a new state-of-the-art studio at 639 Madison Avenue in Memphis, abandoning the old Union Avenue studio where Phillips had recorded B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Lewis, Johnny Cash and others, and also opened a studio in Nashville. It was at the latter studio that Lewis recorded his only major hit during this period, a rendition of Ray Charles's \\"What'd I Say\\" in 1961. In Europe, other updated versions of \\"Sweet Little Sixteen\\" (September 1962 UK) and \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\" (March 1963) entered the hit parade. On popular EPs, \\"Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes\\", \\"I've Been Twistin'\\", \\"Money\\" and \\"Hello Josephine\\" also became turntable hits, especially in nascent discotheques.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change.

If the first test doesn't prove anything, then your doctor might do a longer test called a throat culture. The doctor will rub a swab of fluid from your throat on a special dish and the dish will be left to sit for 2 nights. If you have strep throat, streptococci bacteria will usually grow in the dish within 1-2 days. If you have strep throat, your doctor will give you a prescription to take antibiotics for 10 days. These will probably be pills that you swallow. You will begin to feel better about 24 hours after starting treatment. Even if you don't feel sick anymore, it's important to take the antibiotics for the full 10 days. When one is sick what the body wants and needs is rest. Plus, going to work puts you in danger of many more bacteria that could get you worse and cause you to miss out on more days. Just stay home and relax...you have two good reasons for not going to work so don't worry much about it. Hope you get better hun! ^_^ Some people suffering from strep throat will also get swollen lymph glands in their neck. Others experience vomiting or a red skin rash. How Long Does Strep Throat Last? Strep throat will only last 3 to 7 days with or without treatment. Doctors usually treat strep throat with antibiotics even though they will not make you well any faster. Strep throat contagiousness will continue for 24 hours once antibiotics are started. With no treatment, strep throat continues to be contagious until symptoms resolve. Strep throat is a common type of sore throat in children, but it’s not very common in adults. Healthcare professionals can do a quick test to determine if a sore throat is strep throat. If so, antibiotics can help you feel better faster and prevent spreading it to others. Many things can cause that unpleasant, scratchy, and sometimes painful condition known as a sore throat. Within 3 days after exposure to the germ that causes strep's painful sore throat, you may get sick. Once infected with strep, you are contagious for up to 2 to 3 weeks, …even without symptoms. Up to 24 hours after it has been treated with antibiotics. You should stay home from work or school at least 24 hour after receiving an antibiotic shot or starting an oral ant … ibiotic treatment even if you feel better. A rapid strep test is an easy and accurate test performed to diagnose strep bacteria, causing strep throat. A rapid strep test is performed in the health care practitioner's office.

They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock.\\n\\nCancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band.  The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows.  On June 2, 2006, the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 (CFNY-FM) and then on June 6 Birthing the Giant was released into major record stores. The album includes guest vocals by George Pettit of Alexisonfire. On June 7, 2006 they hosted All Things Rock, a show on MTV Canada, and had their own video played at the end of the show.

Passage 1:University College Dublin A.F.C. was founded in 1895 as the Catholic University Medical School Football Club. They began playing regular games the following year. A First XI played College games against other Universities and a Second XI entered outside competitions. The club was founder members of the Leinster Junior League in 1896 and reached the semi-finals of the Leinster Senior Cup in 1897. The club became University College Dublin when the new University annexed the Medical school in 1908. UCD won the inaugural Intervarsities competition, the Collingwood Cup, in 1914 and added the Irish Intermediate Cup the following year beating Portadown 2–1 in a replayed final. When the Irish Free State was formed in 1921 and the new Football Association of Ireland was formed, UCD participated in the Preliminary round against fellow non-League team Shamrock Rovers in November 1921. The game took place in Windy Arbour and the Hoops won 6–2. UCD were invited to join the League of Ireland in 1922, but had to turn it down on the basis of not being able to field a team in the League of Ireland Shield in September as the Academic year didn't commence until October. In 1945 they won the FAI Intermediate Cup when UCD beat fellow future League of Ireland members Cobh Ramblers 4–2 in the final. UCD appeared in the FAI Cup in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, their final appearance as a non-League outfit coming in 1957 when Cork Athletic beat UCD 4–2 in the Mardyke.\\n Passage 2:Tom Blackburn became ill with terminal lung cancer during the 1963–64 season. Don Donoher, a former Dayton player and assistant coach took over for the final three games of the 1963–64 season. Donoher, with Assistant Coach Chuck Grigsby, guided the Flyers to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in his first two years as coach; they then led the Flyers to the 1967 NCAA Championship game by beating Western Kentucky, #8 ranked Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and #4 ranked North Carolina, before falling to #1 ranked and eventual champion UCLA 79–64 in the final. Donoher's 1967–68 squad began the season ranked #6 in the country in the AP Poll, but faltered in early competition and finished with a 17–9 record, missing the NCAA tournament. Nonetheless, Donoher's Flyers made a successful run through the 1968 NIT field, besting Kansas in the championship to win their second NIT crown. The Flyers would again face UCLA in a pivotal NCAA tournament game in 1974. The 20–7 Flyers squared off against the Bruins in the West Regional Sweet Sixteen and took the Bill Walton-led seven consecutive NCAA Champions to three overtimes before eventually falling 111–100. Donoher would again lead the Flyers to NCAA success in 1984 as Roosevelt Chapman led Flyers bested LSU, #7 ranked Oklahoma, and #15 ranked Washington before falling in the Elite Eight to eventual national champion Georgetown. The 24-season Donoher era was arguably Dayton's finest, producing eight NCAA tournament invitations, and eight NIT invitations. Following the success of the 1967 National Runner Up squad, the University began planning for a new 13,500 seat facility to house the nationally prominent Flyers. The UD Arena became the Flyer's home court at the start of the 1969–70 season.\\n Passage 3:Somersalo was educated at the University of Helsinki before studying natural sciences at the University of Jena. Based in Germany during the First World War he enrolled in the German Army as an officer in 1916, serving until the armistice.

I started thinking about selling it and getting a switch instead so I talked to my girlfriend about it and she told me it was a bad idea and that I’d seem ungrateful. I then talked to my dad and he said it’d be fine and that it made sense for me to do that. So I finally brought it up with my mom and it didn’t go over well.

Passage:Alabama was central to the Civil War, with the secession convention at Montgomery, birthplace of the Confederacy, inviting other states to form a Southern Republic, during January–March 1861, and develop constitutions to legally run their own affairs. The 1861 Alabama Constitution granted citizenship to current U.S. residents, but prohibited import duties (tariffs) on foreign goods, limited a standing military, and as a final issue, opposed emancipation by any nation, but urged protection of African slaves, with trial by jury, and reserved the power to regulate or prohibit the African slave trade. The secession convention invited all slaveholding states to secede, but only 7 Cotton States of the Lower South formed the Confederacy with Alabama, while the majority of slave states were in the Union and voted to make U.S. slavery permanent by passing the Corwin Amendment, signed by President Buchanan and backed by President Lincoln on March 4, 1861.","target":"a","rationale":"The question asks for more than one piece of information from the passage.

They rely on their well-developed sonar to find their way in the water. Toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted. All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure. Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and beaked whales (ziphiids). There are six species, sometimes referred to as \\"blackfish\\", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).The differences between families of odontocetes include size, feeding adaptations and distribution.\\nMonodontids consist of two species: the beluga and the narwhal.

It is an imaginary faraway place, where Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and other mythical creatures and beings live. Although not all people who come to Neverland cease to age, its best known resident famously refused to grow up, and it is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), immortality, and escapism. It was first introduced as \\"the Never Never Land\\" in the theatre play \\"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\\" by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, first staged in 1904.\\n\\n- Captain James Hook is a fictional character, the antagonist of J. M.

It was published in November 1902, by Hodder & Stoughton in the UK and Scribner's in the US, although the latter had released it serially in the monthly \\"Scribner's Magazine\\" from August to November. The book attained prominence and longevity thanks to several chapters written in a softer tone than the rest of the book, which introduced the character and mythology of Peter Pan. In 1906, those chapters were published separately as a children's book, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens.\\n\\n- Fighting Caravans is a 1931 American Pre-Code Western film directed by Otto Brower and David Burton and starring Gary Cooper, Lili Damita, and Ernest Torrence.

The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.\\n\\n- Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901  May 13, 1961) was an American film actor known for his natural, authentic, and understated acting style and screen performances.

The day after Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had an interview with Obama, O’Reilly picked up an additional 1 million viewers for his show The O’Reilly Factor. The president sat down with O’Reilly right before the Super Bowl, and the tone of the conversation itself stirred up a flurry of reactions. Here’s a small example from a moment when O’Reilly pressed Obama on the administration’s response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. O’Reilly: If (Ambassador to the United Nations) Susan Rice goes out and tells the world that it was a spontaneous demonstration... Obama:  Bill... O’Reilly:  -- off a videotape but your... Obama:  Bill... O’Reilly:  -- your commanders and the secretary of Defense know it's a terror attack... Obama:  Now, Bill... O’Reilly:  Just... Obama:  -- Bill... O’Reilly:  -- as an American... Obama:  -- Bill -- Bill... O’Reilly:  -- I'm just confused. Obama:  And I'm -- and I'm trying to explain it to (you), if you want to listen. No wonder that many observers described the interview as testy. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank called it \\"\\"the roughest and nastiest exchange\\"\\" of the three times that O’Reilly has interviewed Obama. \\"\\"He interrupted the president 42 times in 10 minutes,\\"\\" Milbank said on MSNBC’s Politics Nation. Of all the words uttered in this 10-minute interview, 40 percent were uttered by O’Reilly.\\"\\" We wanted to check Milbank’s numbers. Not on the interruptions, but on the word count. We pulled out our digital centrifuge and separated the O’Reilly and Obama utterances. According to our research, O’Reilly delivered 787 words to Obama’s 1,484. This gave O’Reilly 35 percent of the conversation. That’s a little lower than Milbank said but more or less in the same ballpark. We reached out to Milbank and did not hear back. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare this with another one-on-one interview between the president and a journalist. A couple of days before Obama sat down with O’Reilly, he did the same with CNN’s Jake Tapper. We subjected that transcript to the same rigorous methods and found that Tapper spoke 23 percent of the time, leaving the president the other 77 percent. The precise word counts were Tapper -- 849 and Obama -- 2,886. Milbank’s point was that O’Reilly’s interview was almost as much about O’Reilly as it was about the president. We don’t know about that, but we can say that O’Reilly spoke about 50 percent more than Tapper did in his interview. The topics in the two interviews differed greatly. O’Reilly brought up Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Tapper focused on issues like immigration reform, legalization of marijuana, spying by the National Security Agency, and security at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. O’Reilly had a second installment of his time with Obama that aired the night after the Super Bowl. Milbank’s comment came on the same night, so we’re counting only the segment that had aired publicly at that point. For the record, in the second installment, O’Reilly asked the president about African-American children raised in single-parent households, school vouchers, the Keystone pipeline, a contraceptive coverage exemption for Little Sisters of the Poor, and veterans benefits. Our ruling Milbank said O’Reilly said 40 percent of the words during his interview with the president. That was a little high. By our count, 35 percent would be more accurate. O’Reilly spoke decidedly more than Tapper did in his time with Obama.\\" Claim: Dana Milbank Says Bill O’Reilly spoke 40 percent of the words in an interview with President Barack Obama.","target":"2","rationale":"The claim says that Dana Milbank said Bill O'Reilly spoke 40% of the words in an interview with Barack Obama. The paragraph then says that Dana Milbank, a columnist for the Washington Post described the interview as testy and said that O'Reilly interrupted Obama 42 times in 10 minutes. This is followed by a report on how many words were spoken by each person during the interview. According to this report, O'Reilly spoke 35% of the time during this interview and Tapper (another journalist) spoke only 23%. Therefore, it is clear that Dana Milbank's claim is false since he overestimated how much time O'Reilly had spent talking during his conversation with President Obama."},{"source":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: An American familyâDr. Benjamin \\"Ben\\" McKenna (James Stewart), his wife, popular singer Josephine Conway \\"Jo\\" McKenna (Doris Day), and their son Henry \\"Hank\\" McKenna (Christopher Olsen)âare vacationing in Morocco.

Not only did they become close friends; Feuerbach's criticism of religion, which also strongly influenced Karl Marx, had a great impact on Kapp's attitude towards life as well. Other acquaintances from his time as a student were Ludwig Bamberger (1823–1899), who would later become a banker, the author Berthold Auerbach (1812–1882) of Heidelberg and the poet Bettina von Arnim (1785–1859) of Berlin.

In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27-17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions.

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money....\\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\\nQuestion: Why was this plan executed?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. because its potential success was recognized\\n\\nB. because of its cost\\n\\nC. because of the general manager's action\\n\\nD. not enough information","target":"A","rationale":"The context of the passage discusses IBM's \\"design thinking revolution\\" where design thinkers were hired to help transform the company. The author states that hiring 1000 designers is not enough, because they will eventually leave and their change efforts won't be sustained.\\nSo why was this plan executed? Well, it must have been seen as a success by someone (the General Manager) so much so that he wanted to expand his program even further! This means that A - because its potential success was recognized - is definitely true based on what we've read in the text; thus it would make sense for him to continue investing money into training more people at his firm with these skillsets."},{"source":"Compared with a less powerful device, a more powerful device can either do more work in the same time or do the same work in less time.\\n\\nHaving read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are Andrew or Tim ):\\n\\n\\nAndrew was showing Tim his brand new phone, one day.

The game started with the Packers in possession and the Packers started off the game with a nice 14-yard run by RB Ryan Grant for a first down. On the first third down of the drive, Aaron Rodgers completed his first pass of the day to TE Donald Lee for an 11-yard gain. Colts CB Marlin Jackson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after the play and the Colts were penalized 15&#160;yards for the Packers 49 down to the Colts 36-yard line. After a 1-yard run and an incomplete pass on 1st and second downs, Rodgers completed a 6-yard pass to TE Donald Lee on 3rd and 9 but was nullified when Colts CB Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive holding on WR Greg Jennings during the play resulting in a 5-yard penalty and a 1st down. The next play was a run by RB Ryan Grant for 4&#160;yards. Grant fumbled the ball on the play and it looked to be recovered by the Colts, but the ball slipped past the defenders and FB Korey Hall dove onto the ball and recovered the fumble for the Packers. Grant then followed up the play with a 5-yard gain on 2nd down and a surprise hand off to FB John Kuhn on 3rd down and 1 for 3&#160;yards secured another 1st down for the Packers at the Colts 18-yard line. The drive ended with an incomplete pass the WR Ruvell Martin on 3rd down and the Packers were forced to settle for a Mason Crosby 31-yard field goal to take the early 3-0 lead. After the field goal, The Packers attempted to onside kick but the ball went out of bounds after 15&#160;yards. On the retry, Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds again but this time it was much farther down field. The ball was then placed at the Colts 45-yard line but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved the ball back to the Colts 30-yard line. On the Colts first drive, they seemed to be able to move the ball very well with runs by the injured starter  Joseph Addai's replacement Dominic Rhodes paired with a 9-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on CB Tramon Williams on 3rd and 1 at the Colts 39, QB Peyton Manning connected with WR Reggie Wayne for a 15-yard gain on the next 3rd down to the GB 16-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed the ball four consecutive times and capped the drive with a 3-yard rush for the touchdown. The Colts took the 7-3 lead with 4:06 left in the 1st. The Packers second drive of the game started with an Aaron Rodgers pass left to Greg Jennings for 14&#160;yards under soft coverage. Ryan Grant continued rushing the ball better with a nice 7-yard gain on the next play to the Green Bay 41-yard line. Rodgers failed to connect on a pass deep to Greg Jennings on the next play but CB Tim Jennings was flagged for pass interference resulting in a 25-yard penalty down to the Colts 34-yard line. After a couple of short runs by Ryan Grant, Rodgers completed a 7-yard pass to Greg Jennings on 3rd and 6 for the first down. After a Colts neutral zone infraction penalty and a couple more short rush attempts by Ryan Grant, The Packers first touchdown of the game was scored on a 12-yard pass to TE Donald Lee. With a little more than 14&#160;minutes left in the 2nd quarter, the Packers took the 10-7 lead. The Colts continued to attempt to move the ball on their next drive with runs and short passes to the running backs and tight ends but their drive stalled near midfield when Peyton Manning completed a pass to WR Marvin Harrison a-yard short of the first down. It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach Tony Dungy thought otherwise and Peyton Manning left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision. After the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR Donald Driver to the 35-yard line. After a short 3-yard gain by Ryan Grant and two 3-yard receptions by Donald Driver, the Packers were faced with a 4 and 1 at their own 44-yard line much like the Colts on their previous drive. Instead of punting like the Colts did, the Packers kept their offense on the field a managed to get the first down on a nice 7-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 33-yard line with a few short runs by Ryan Grant mixed with a short pass to RB Brandon Jackson for 9&#160;yards. On 2nd a 7 Rodgers dropped back to pass and looked to throw to WR Greg Jennings but decided to dump the ball off the Brandon Jackson for the second time on the drive but he was tackled for a 1-yard loss. During the play a flag was thrown for illegal use of the hands on CB Tim Jennings who was coving Greg Jennings on the play. After a rush for no gain on 1st down at the Colts 28, Rodgers connected with WR Ruvell Martin for 17&#160;yards to the Colts 11-yard line. The Packers scored their second touchdown of the day on the next play with an 11-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers now held a 17-7 lead with 2:53 left in the half. Now in a ten-point hole, The Colts offense took the field again but could not manage to get a first down. DT Ryan Pickett batted down the pass intended for Marvin Harrison on 3rd down and forced the Colts to punt. With 1:54 remaining in the half the Packers started their final drive of the half on their own 33-yard line. The drive featured many short passes to RB Brandon Jackson for decent gains along with a Rodgers scramble down the middle of the field for a 9-yard gain. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 18-yard line and took a time out with 9&#160;seconds left. Mason Crosby attempted a 36-yard field goal but the kick was pushed wide left. The half ended with Peyton Manning taking a knee and the Packers went in the half with a 17-7 lead. The Colts started the second half with possession and managed to move the ball to the Packers 48-yard line, but a pass to Reggie Wayne on 3rd and 6 went through his hands and popped up into the air. FS Nick Collins who was a couple yards behind Wayne was in perfect position to intercept the ball and returned it 62&#160;yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24-7 lead early in the 3rd. After the interception return the Colts offense took the field and managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28-yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's Adam Vinatieri attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT Johnny Jolly. The Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&#160;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by Ryan Grant. The highlight of the drive took place when FB Korey Hall received a pass from Aaron Rodgers and hurdled over the oncoming defender. The drive ended when Ryan Grant couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by Mason Crosby to extend the lead to 27-7. The Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by Peyton Manning. The Colts punted and the Packers ended the 3rd quarter with 2 rushes by Ryan Grant. The first play of the 4th was an incomplete pass to TE Tory Humphrey and the Packers were forced to punt for the first time of the contest. The Colts again couldn't move the ball on their next possession and were forced to punt, The Packers took over and gain one first down on a pass to Brandon Jackson, but they failed to break into Colts territory and punted for the second time of the contest. With time not on the Colts side, the Colts drove down all the way to the Packers 5-yard line and were looking to score. Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to Dallas Clark earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by Charles Woodson but S Aaron Rouse batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR Anthony Gonzalez at the 1-yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&#160;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34-7 with about 4:30 remaining in the game. In a prevent style defense, the Packers allowed the Colts offense to move down the field to the Green Bay 15. Peyton Manning threw the ball to Anthony Gonzalez at the goal line and he looked to be in for the score. The booth reviewed the catch and the call on the field was reversed. On the next play, Manning completed another pass to Dallas Clark and he dove for the pylon for the score. The booth reviewed the touchdown and again the touchdown wasn't awarded but the ball was placed at the 1-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed 1-yard for the touchdown to decrease the Packers lead to 34-14. The Colts lined up in an onside kick formation but kicker Adam Vinatieri instead kicked the ball shallow and it was easily caught by Charles Woodson. Ryan Grant rushed for 9&#160;yards on 1st down to put him over the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and two Aaron Rodgers kneel downs sealed the dominating victory. With the win, the Green Bay Packers improved their record to 4-3 going into the bye week.\\n\\nHow many points difference was there between the Packers and the Colts after Dominic Rhodes rushed for the touchdown?","target":"20","rationale":"The difference between the Packers and Colts after Dominic Rhodes rushed for a touchdown was 20 points.

Ten Holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM) and were killed 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation. Twenty-four hours before the calves were killed, 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously. The components of the tissue valves, i.e., three leaflets and sewing rings, were separated. Each leaflet was cut into four sections: free edge, central zone, flexion zone, and attachment zone. From the radioactivity in blood, leaflet zones, sewing rings, area of leaflet zones, platelet count, and fibrinogen level in blood, the mean regional density of adherent platelets, fibrinogen-fibrin, and fibrinogen/platelet were calculated. The density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation. The number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones, suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The numerical data included in the abstract are: 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM), 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen, 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation.

Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which sample would have higher percentage of uranium-235, sample A or sample B?","target":"sample B","rationale":"We know that naturally occurring uranium has a composition of 99% U-238 and 1% U-235.

Gunn is best known for his appearances in the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) from 1993 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2015. He also served as a coach on WWE's Tough Enough, and was a trainer in its developmental branch, NXT. He is also known for his appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) from 2005 to 2009.\\n\\nOn February 13, 2005, Sopp debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) without a name (as Billy Gunn is a WWE trademark, although announcers recognized him as such) at Against All Odds with the same gimmick, helping Jeff Jarrett retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a match with Kevin Nash. Sopp, using the name The New Age Outlaw, then formed a stable with Jarrett and Monty Brown known as Planet Jarrett. However, WWE threatened TNA with legal action if Sopp continued the use of the name \\"The New Age Outlaw\\", so he shortened his name to The Outlaw. Due to the legal issues with WWE, all TNA DVD releases featuring footage with Sopp as \\"The Outlaw\\" (and presumably also as \\"The New Age Outlaw\\") have had the name on on-screen graphics blurred, the name silenced out of the audio, and match commentary completely replaced to reflect a retroactive name change to \\"Kip James\\". One such DVD is the pay-per-view Lockdown, included in the \\"TNA Anthology: The Epic Set\\" box set, in which the silencing of the name during a segment where Dusty Rhodes picks his name from a lottery leaves DVD viewers in the dark as to who just got picked.  The Outlaw began a campaign to make former ally B.G. James leave the 3Live Kru and defect to Planet Jarrett, reforming the old tag team with Outlaw. At No Surrender (2005), he renamed himself Kip James and was announced as \\"wrestling out of Marietta, Georgia\\" (the family seat of the Armstrong family) as a psychological ploy. As a result of his campaign, Kip attracted the ire of 3Live Kru members Ron Killings and Konnan, leading to a series of tag team matches pitting Kip and Monty Brown against Killings and Konnan, with a conflicted James unwilling to take sides. Kip's efforts ultimately proved futile; James, the guest referee in a final match between Brown and Kip versus Konnan and Killings at Sacrifice (2005), attacked Kip enabling a 3Live Kru victory.  In September at Unbreakable, Kip teamed with Brown to defeat the team of Apolo and Lance Hoyt. There was clear tension between the partners because Brown was unhappy at the series of losses at the hands of the 3Live Kru, and Kip was irked by Brown's decision to leave Planet Jarrett. Despite the victory, the partners argued after the match. On the October 8, 2005 episode of Impact!, Kip rekindled his feud with the 3Live Kru, running to the ring after a bout between the 3LK and Team Canada in order to prevent Team Canada captain Petey Williams from beating down B.G. James. He saved James, and then engaged in a staredown with Konnan and Killings. Kip saved James from Team Canada once again at Bound for Glory. Though Killings showed signs of gratitude, Konnan remained skeptical as to his true intentions. Later that night, Kip took part in an over-the-top-rope gauntlet match for the number one contendership to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After he was eliminated, he tried in vain to prevent Killings from being eliminated as well, before being sent away from ringside by the referees.\\n\\nAsk a question about this article.","target":"What are some interesting aspects of this article","rationale":"Based on the above paragraph, we can observe that Monty Kip Sopp has worked with a number of organizations like WWF/E and TNA.

For the first time, the disease long seen in the country’s remote areas is largely concentrated in its two largest cities, Antananarivo and Toamasina. Global health officials have responded quickly. The World Health Organization, criticized for its slow response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, has released $1.5 million and sent plague specialists and epidemiologists. The Red Cross is sending its first-ever plague treatment center to Madagascar. On Wednesday, Madagascar’s minister of public health rallied doctors and paramedics in a packed auditorium at the country’s main hospital, saying they’re not allowed to go on vacation. “Let’s be strong, because it’s only us. We’re at the front, like the military,” Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo said. The outbreak could continue until the end of infection season in April, experts warn. Madagascar has about 400 plague cases per year, or more than half of the world’s total, according to a 2016 World Health Organization report. Usually, they are cases of bubonic plague in the rural highlands. Bubonic plague is carried by rats and spread to humans through flea bites. It is fatal about the half the time, if untreated. Most of the cases in the current outbreak are pneumonic plague, a more virulent form that spreads through coughing, sneezing or spitting and is almost always fatal if untreated. In some cases, it can kill within 24 hours. Like the bubonic form, it can be treated with common antibiotics if caught in time. The WHO calls plague a “disease of poverty” caused in part by unsanitary living conditions. Madagascar has a per capita GDP of about $400, and national programs to control the disease have been “hampered by operational and management difficulties,” according to a report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. But the airborne pneumonic plague, which accounts for about 75 percent of cases in the current outbreak, makes no class distinctions. “Normally, the people who catch the plague are dirty people who live in poor areas, but in this case we find the well-to-do, the directors, the professors, people in every place in society, catching the disease,” said Dr. Manitra Rakotoarivony, Madagascar’s director of health promotion. The current outbreak began in August, earlier than usual, when a 31-year-old man who had spent time in a village in the central highlands, Ankazobe, traveled by bush taxi to the east coast, unaware that he had the plague. He died en route and was buried without any safety precautions in Toamasina. Four people in contact with him also died. Residents of the capital began to relax in recent days amid the global response to the outbreak, but the disease remains a serious threat with the number of new cases per day remaining steady. Madagascar has fought the disease for more than a century. It was introduced to the island in 1898 when steamships from India brought rats infected with the bacteria that causes the disease. The plague nearly disappeared from Madagascar for 60 years, starting in 1930, but re-emerged in recent decades. The black rats that carry the disease in the highlands have gradually developed resistance to it. Unsafe burial practices that involve touching corpses are another reason the disease spreads, according to a 2015 study by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar. The outbreak has alarmed neighboring countries. A 34-year-old man in another Indian Ocean island nation, the Seychelles, contracted the pneumonic plague while in Madagascar. He was treated in his own country and no longer has symptoms. It was the first-ever plague case in the Seychelles, said the country’s public health commissioner, Dr. Jude Gedeon. Another Seychellois, a 49-year-old basketball coach, died of the plague last month while in Antananarivo for a tournament. Seychelles authorities have established a plague isolation ward and announced that schools will be closed through Tuesday. Foreign travelers who have recently visited Madagascar are not being allowed into the country. While the WHO says the risk of the epidemic spreading beyond the region is very low and does not advise restrictions on travel to Madagascar, Air Seychelles has canceled all flights to and from the island until further notice. “The situation is still not under control in Madagascar,” Gedeon said.

The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime.

However, the original CFR algorithm only works for discrete states and action spaces, and the resulting strategy is maintained as a tabular representation. Such tabular representation limits the method from being directly applied to large games. In this paper, we propose a double neural representation for the IIGs, where one neural network represents the cumulative regret, and the other represents the average strategy.   Such neural representations allow us to avoid manual game abstraction and carry out end-to-end optimization. To make the learning efficient, we also developed several novel techniques including a robust sampling method and a mini-batch Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) method, which may be of independent interests.   Empirically, on games tractable to tabular approaches, neural strategies trained with our algorithm converge comparably to their tabular counterparts, and significantly outperform those based on deep reinforcement learning.   On extremely large games with billions of decision nodes, our approach achieved strong performance while using hundreds of times less memory than the tabular CFR. On head-to-head matches of hands-up no-limit texas hold'em, our neural agent beat the strong agent ABS-CFR by $9.8\\\\pm4.1$ chips per game.

Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses). A predator at the top of any food chain (that is, one that is preyed upon by no organism) is called an apex predator; examples include the orca, sperm whale, anaconda, Komodo dragon, tiger, lion, tiger shark, Nile crocodile, and most eagles and owls—and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears. An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat, such as a dog among alligators, a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray, or a snapping turtle among jaguars; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators, such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments, can become an apex predator by default.; \\n\\nQuestion: What is an autotroph called when its on top of the food chain? \\n\\nIs this question answerable?","target":"no","rationale":"The question asks for a term that describes an autotroph when it is on top of the food chain. \\nHowever, since an autotroph does not depend on other organisms for energy or nourishment and thus cannot be part of any trophic pyramid, there are no terms to describe its position within such structures.

He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost.

If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red.

It connects the previous two installments, bringing in characters introduced in each. Burroughs completes the revelation of his lost world's unique biological system, only hinted at in the previous installment, in which the slow progress of evolution in the world outside is recapitulated as a matter of individual metamorphosis. This system forms a thematic element serving to unite the three otherwise rather loosely linked Caspak stories.The book begins with Bradley, who had left Fort Dinosaur on an expedition in the first novel and never returned. Bradley and his party are attempting to return to Fort Dinosaur. Along the way, they encounter a creature which appears to be a flying dead man. Some of the members of the party consider it to be a ghost or banshee. Tippet is convinced that he is soon to die, and the next day he is killed by a Tyrannosaurus. The ghost-like creature is seen again, and James is killed by a Smilodon. Bradley disappears during the night, and the remaining members of the party make it safely to Fort Dinosaur.\\nBradley had been captured by the ghost-like creature, which is soon revealed to be a naturally winged human being, belonging to a subgroup of humanity known as the Wieroo. The Wieroo takes Bradley to the island of Oo-oh, set in Caspak's inland sea. It attempts to keep Bradley in a prison, but he escapes through a secret passage. He meets Co-Tan, a member of the highest human race of mainland Caspak, the Galu, fully human and of a neolithic cultural level. They enter the chamber of the Wieroo king, a huge member of the race, and Bradley kills the creature with its own sword.\\nCo-Tan and Bradley escape the city of the Wieroo and live for several months on the forested coast of Oo-oh. Finally, though, they are discovered by Wieroo. They succeed in capturing two of the Wieroo and forcing them to fly to the mainland, one bearing each of the humans.\\nOn the Caspakian mainland, Co-Tan and Bradley meet the party from the outside world from the previous two books, and they return home to America, where Bradley will marry Co-Tan.","target":"What group does the ghost-like creature belong to?","rationale":"The ghost-like creature is a naturally winged human being and belongs to the Wieroo group.

It has become clear that viral genomic RNAs are not simply carriers of hereditary information, but rather are active players in many critical stages during replication. Indeed, functions such as cap-independent translation initiation mechanisms are, in some cases, primarily driven by RNA structural determinants. Other stages including reverse transcription initiation in retroviruses, nuclear export and viral packaging are specifically dependent on the proper 3-dimensional folding of multiple RNA domains to recruit necessary viral and host factors required for activity. Furthermore, a large-scale conformational change within the 5′-untranslated region of HIV-1 has been proposed to regulate the temporal switch between viral protein synthesis and packaging. These RNA-dependent functions are necessary for replication of many human disease-causing viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, West Nile virus, and HIV-1. The potential for antiviral development is currently hindered by a poor understanding of RNA-driven molecular mechanisms, resulting from a lack of structural information on large RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes. Herein, we describe the recent progress that has been made on characterizing these large RNAs and provide brief descriptions of the techniques that will be at the forefront of future advances. Ongoing and future work will contribute to a more complete understanding of the lifecycles of retroviruses and RNA viruses and potentially lead to novel antiviral strategies.","target":"Progress and outlook in structural biology of large viral RNAs NIH Public Access","rationale":"The title should be a summary of the paper, which highlights the key findings and implications of the research.

Last year's quarterfinalist Kei Nishikori also came through over Victor Hănescu.

Writing for Mojo magazine in 2002, David Fricke credited Cleave's Lennon interview and the \\"More popular than Jesus\\" controversy as marking the start of modern music journalism. He said that it was \\"no coincidence\\" that Paul Williams, a seventeen-year-old Swarthmore College student, launched America's first serious rock publication, Crawdaddy!, in 1966, given the Beatles' influence and Lennon's \\"sense of mission\\" as a spokesman for youth culture. Lennon's comments continued to be the subject of scrutiny in right-wing religious literature, particularly in the writing of David Noebel, a longstanding critic of the Beatles' influence on American youth.

I expressed my concerns about money, wanting to be able to continue saving for retirement, to have money for going on a vacation, to have money to have the house remodeled.  We have a nice house, two older cars, are able to go out to dinner when we want, but do not go on expensive vacations or otherwise indulge ourselves.  It would be very helpful to have the additional income\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThree years later, my wife has not found a job.  She finally has told me that she does not want to work, and that since I make so much money, that she does not need to work.

They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.\\n\\nA scientist has just returned to the lab after working out in the field.

He is the older brother of Jeff Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1986. Hardy played baseball as a child and throughout high school, but had stopped by his senior year.\\n\\nShortly after the departure of Matt and Jeff from TNA was made public, Matt's wife, Reby, went on a social media tirade in which she repeatedly slammed TNA, the company's new management and the way in which contract negotiations between the company and the Hardy family were conducted. A few weeks following this, the bad blood between the two sides intensified, so much so that the new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay-per-view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.  Newly-appointed Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm credits the invention of and the vision behind the Broken gimmick to Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana and Billy Corgan, and while Borash specifically had the most input into the gimmick of the three aside from Matt, the Hardy family deny that Borash was the sole person behind the gimmick. In November 2017, Impact Wrestling changed their policy, allowing all talent to retain complete ownership over their intellectual property, essentially forfeiting ownership of the \\"Broken\\" character to Hardy.

Passage 1:The original catalyst for development was the ill-fated vanity project by Lord Kensington (died 1852) which consisted of the two-mile conversion of the insanitary Counter's Creek into the Kensington Canal (1826 onwards), followed by its eventual replacement first by \\"Mr Punch's railway\\", opened in 1844 and next, by the Metropolitan District Railway in 1865–69, which eventually became London Underground's District Line and was joined after 1907 by the Piccadilly line. Meanwhile, the congestion apparent in London and Middlesex for burials at the start of the century was causing public concern not least on health grounds. In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground on the edge of Earl's Court in an outlying area of Brompton. The moving spirit behind the project was the engineer, Stephen Geary. It was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the proposal. Securing the land – some 40 acres – from local landowner, Lord Kensington and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge. After two years the cemetery was duly established by Act of Parliament and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. It was consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London in June 1840, and is now one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries, served by the adjacent West Brompton station.\\n Passage 2:Bonko first sought political office in the 1995 municipal election, when he was elected to the Board of Edmonton Public Schools as trustee for Ward A. He was re-elected in the 1998 and 2001 elections. He did not seek re-election at the conclusion of his third term. Instead, he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in Edmonton Decore in the 2004 provincial election as a Liberal. He won 44.63% of the vote and defeated his opponents, who included former MLA Walter Szwender who was running for the Progressive Conservatives and Gary Masyk, an incumbent MLA whose riding had been abolished and who had crossed the floor to become the Alberta Alliance's first MLA after being elected as PC. He did not sponsor any bills during his time in the legislature, and was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Janice Sarich in the 2008 election.\\n Passage 3:With the outbreak of the Civil War, Weed was promoted captain of the newly formed Battery I, 5th U.S. Artillery in May 1861. He remained at Camp Curtin in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, training his crews until the spring of 1862, when they served in the Peninsula Campaign and at Second Bull Run. He commanded his battery during the fierce artillery duel at Antietam. Promoted to command of all the artillery of the V Corps, his guns were in action at the Battle of Fredericksburg. From December 1862 through January 1863, he was stationed at Falmouth, Virginia. After a short leave of absence, he took part in the Battle of Chancellorsville, commanding the artillery of the 2nd Division, V Corps.

Ferguson attended Broomloan Road Primary School and later Govan High School. He began his football career with Harmony Row Boys Club in Govan, before progressing to Drumchapel Amateurs, a youth club with a strong reputation for producing senior footballers.\\n\\nAlthough the team had a slow start to the 2008-09 season, United won the Premier League with a game to spare, making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the Premier League three times consecutively, on two separate occasions. Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008-09 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total. They also won the League Cup on penalties after a goalless Wembley draw with Tottenham.  They contested the 2009 Champions League final against Barcelona on 27 May 2009 but lost 2-0.  In 2009-10, Ferguson added another League Cup to his honours list as United defeated Aston Villa 2-1 in the Wembley final on 28 February 2010. However, his dreams of a third European Cup were ended a few weeks later when United were edged out of the competition in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich on away goals. And their hopes of a record 19th league title were ended on the last day of the season when Chelsea beat them to the Premier League title, crushing Wigan Athletic 8-0 and rendering United's 4-0 win over Stoke City meaningless.  He ended the season by winning his 12th and Manchester United's 19th league title and thus overtaking Liverpool's record of 18. Manchester United faced Barcelona again on 28 May 2011 in the 2011 Champions League final, their third in four years, but United lost 3-1. Analyst Alan Hansen stated that he believed Ferguson was \\"the key component\\" in United's success that season, so key in fact that \\"[he] would have claimed the crown with any of the other top sides had he been in charge of them\\". With Edwin van der Sar, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes all retiring in 2011, Ferguson spent big by signing defender Phil Jones from Blackburn and winger Ashley Young from Aston Villa for around PS17 million each, and goalkeeper David de Gea from Atletico Madrid for around PS19 million.  On 2 September 2012, Ferguson managed his 1,000th league game with United against Southampton. United won the game 3-2 thanks to a hat-trick from Robin van Persie.

The third U.S. President (1801--09), Thomas Jefferson, is featured on the obverse of the note. The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull. Throughout the $2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note, National Bank Note, silver certificate, Treasury or \`\`Coin'' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note. When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. Production went on until 1966, when the series was discontinued. Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. Two-dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand. This comparative scarcity in circulation, coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation, has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases. \\nQuestion: can you still use a $2 bill\\nAnswer:","target":"Yes","rationale":"The $2 bill is the only circulating currency that features a president other than Washington, and it has been reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design.

The film contains excerpts from speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction. Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. The film's overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power, with Hitler as the leader who will bring glory to the nation. Because the film was made after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives (on 30 June), many prominent Sturmabteilung (SA) members are absent—they were murdered in that Party purge, organised and orchestrated by Hitler to replace the SA with the Schutzstaffel (SS) as his main paramilitary force.","target":"b","rationale":"There is information about the director, Leni Riefenstahl, in the passage and a clue regarding her death: \\"The film was made after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives (on 30 June), many prominent Sturmabteilung (SA) members are absent\\\\u2014they were murdered in that Party purge\\".

The serum Cr values were extremely high (20 to 50 times higher than the normal serum level). The amount of Cr absorbed from the dialysate was calculated to be ten times higher than the daily dietary uptake. The Co concentrations were normal in packed cells but were significantly increased in serum. The Rb content in packed cells was slightly lower than normal, while the serum value was normal. Se was maintained within the normal range in packed cells, but the serum concentration was slightly lower than normal. The concentrations of Zn were low in serum and appeared to be higher than normal in packed cells. In conclusion, this analysis of the trace element status of CAPD patients reveals two major abnormalities. There is an apparent loss of Br from the blood towards the dialysate and on the other hand, a dramatic accumulation of Cr into the blood as a result of the very high Cr content in the dialysate.","target":"Comparative Study","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that compared the trace element patterns in serum, packed cells, and dialysate of CAPD patients.

In the present studies we have examined whether calmodulin participates in this response to T3. Initial experiments provided evidence that calmodulin is involved in regulating the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in this tissue. Thus, compared with findings in freshly prepared membranes, dialysis of thymocyte plasma membrane preparations for 20 h at 4 C decreased their calmodulin concentrations from an initial value of approximately 600 ng/100 micrograms protein by about 50% and decreased adenylate cyclase activity by approximately 80%. Although storage of the same preparations under comparable conditions resulted in no change in calmodulin content, it caused an approximate 30% decrease in adenylate cyclase activity. Addition of calmodulin had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in fresh or stored membrane preparations, but produced a dose-dependent increase in enzyme activity in preparations that had been dialyzed. Further, when added to freshly isolated membranes, three calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine, calmidazolium, and calmodulin antibodies, all produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and this was completely reversed in all cases by the addition of high concentrations of exogenous calmodulin. The stimulation of guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase activity that T3 induced in fresh membrane preparations was present in membranes that had been stored, but was absent in those that had been dialyzed. In addition, the response to T3 in fresh membranes was inhibited or abolished by all three calmodulin antagonists. Both in dialyzed membranes and in the presence of antagonists, the response to T3 was restored by the addition of exogenous calmodulin. We conclude that calmodulin influences the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in rat thymocytes and ultimately mediates the stimulation of enzyme activity that T3 produces. Such mediation very likely explains the calcium-dependent nature of the stimulatory effect of T3 on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity.","target":"Calmodulin mediates the stimulatory effect of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine on adenylate cyclase activity in rat thymocyte plasma membranes","rationale":"The abstract describes how calmodulin participates in the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity and ultimately mediates the stimulatory effect of T3 on thymocyte adenylate cyclase.

What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world.\\nBefore embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than $450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The $175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia.

Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin.

The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin.

Many politicians, including the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are of the view that a political party's performance in Istanbul is more significant than its general performance overall. This is due to the city's role as Turkey's financial centre, its large electorate and the fact that Erdoğan himself was elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. In the run-up to local elections in 2019, Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.Historically, Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general election, with 41.74% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election on 24 June 2018. Erdoğan, the AKP's presidential candidate, received exactly 50.0% of the vote in the presidential election held on the same day. Starting with Erdoğan in 1994, Istanbul has had a conservative mayor for 25 years, until 2019. The second largest party in Istanbul is the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also the country's main opposition. The left-wing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is the city's third largest political force due to a substantial number of Kurdish people migrating from south-eastern Turkey.\\nMore recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the 2014 mayoral election where the centre-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the 2017 constitutional referendum, where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country....","target":"Binali","rationale":"The article mentions the losing candidate and their vote percentage in 2019.

At the same voltage, DC often has less loss than AC, and for this reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire. Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. A few railroads have tried 3-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle.
