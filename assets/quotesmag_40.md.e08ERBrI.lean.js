At the start of the tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences.\\nThe first stage of the tour's itinerary took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels and then on to Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first symphonies. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766.\\nThe material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service. However, the journey enabled the children to experience to the full the cosmopolitan musical world, and gave them an outstanding education. In Wolfgang's case this would continue through further journeys in the following six years, prior to his appointment by the Prince-Archbishop as a court musician.","target":"Maria Anna","rationale":"In the first sentence of the article we can see that it is about a family trip taken by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria and their children.

In China, before establishment of the republic, only the emperor could wear yellow. History provides many examples of elaborate sumptuary laws that regulated what people could wear.

He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed.

Stopping the fire caused much fire and demolition damage in the lawyers' area called the Temple. Pepys walked all over the smouldering city, getting his feet hot, and climbed the steeple of Barking Church, from which he viewed the destroyed City, \\"the saddest sight of desolation that I ever saw.\\" There were many separate fires still burning themselves out, but the Great Fire was over. The following Sunday, rain fell over the city extinguishing the fire. However, it took until the following March before embers stopped reigniting.Pepys visited Moorfields, a large public park immediately north of the City, and saw a great encampment of homeless refugees, \\"poor wretches carrying their good there, and every body keeping his goods together by themselves\\". He noted that the price of bread had doubled in the environs of the park. Evelyn also went out to Moorfields, which was turning into the main point of assembly for the homeless, and was horrified at the numbers of distressed people filling it, some under tents, others in makeshift shacks: \\"Many [were] without a rag or any necessary utensils, bed or board ... reduced to extremest misery and poverty.\\" Evelyn was impressed by the pride of these distressed Londoners, \\"tho' ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking one pennie for relief.\\"\\nFears were as high as ever among the traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion. There was an outbreak of general panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty.\\nApparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained.\\nThe nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long.\\nShe then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.”\\nQuestion: How did the junior nurses clean the ceiling\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. with bleach\\n\\nB. with a mop\\n\\nC. not enough information\\n\\nD. with alcohol","target":"C","rationale":"The context describes a patient who had his appendix removed and an infection formed, causing the wound to leak blood.

Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.

Kaplansky was born in Biaystok in what is now Poland and emigrated to Montreal after graduating from high school in 1929 . He attempted to enroll at McGill University but the university 's registrar told the young Jewish immigrant that \`\` my job is to keep people like you out of the university .

There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans. Further offshoots include the first-language English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans, Zambians, Swazilanders and Namibians.\\n\\n- Canadian English (CanE, CE, en-CA) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada. According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.\\n\\n- British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"\\n\\n- International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and between nations. It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts.\\n\\n- Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\\nRights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\".\\n\\n- The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. John Locke defined freedom under the rule of law as follows:\\n\\n- Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"\\n\\n- Human rights are moral principles or norms, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \\"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,\\" and which are \\"inherent in all human beings\\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.\\n\\n- A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'kalmen kaplansky' with the relationship of 'occupation'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- activist\\n - canada\\n - criminal\\n - general\\n - human rights\\n - human rights activist\\n - justice\\n - lawyer\\n - major\\n - official\\n - religion\\n - theologian\\n - torturer\\n - united kingdom","target":"human rights activist","rationale":"The question asks to identify the occupation of Kalmen Kaplansky, a person that is mentioned in paragraph 6.

Cdk5 regulates a variety of neuronal activities including migration, synaptic activity and neuronal death. p35 and p39 impart cytoplasmic membrane association of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5, respectively, through their myristoylation, but it is not clearly understood how the cellular localization is related to different functions. We investigated the role of Cdk5 activity in the subcellular localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5. Cdk5 activity affected the localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5 through phosphorylation of p35 or p39. Using unphosphorylated or phosphomimetic mutants of p35 and p39, we found that phosphorylation at Ser8, common to p35 and p39, by Cdk5 regulated the cytoplasmic localization and perinuclear accumulation of unphosphorylated S8A mutants, and whole cytoplasmic distribution of phosphomimetic S8E mutants. Cdk5 activity was necessary to retain Cdk5-activator complexes in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, small but distinct amounts of p35 and p39 were detected in the nucleus. In particular, nuclear p35 and p39 were increased when the Cdk5 activity was inhibited. p39 had a greater propensity to accumulate in the nucleus than p35, and phosphorylation at Thr84, specific to p39, regulated the potential nuclear localization activity of the Lys cluster in p39. These results suggest that the subcellular localization of the Cdk5-activator complexes is determined by its kinase activity, and also implicate a role for p39-Cdk5 in the nucleus.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract provides detailed information about the role of Cdk5 activity in the subcellular localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5.

In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.\\n\\n- Gaborone is situated between Kgale and Oodi Hills, on the Notwane River in the south-eastern corner of Botswana, and from the South African border.

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda?\\nI learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”.

Largely self-taught, Takemitsu possessed consummate skill in the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is famed for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy to create a sound uniquely his own, and for fusing opposites together such as sound with silence and tradition with innovation. He composed several hundred independent works of music, scored more than ninety films and published twenty books.\\n\\nTakemitsu was born in Tokyo on October 8, 1930; a month later his family moved to Dalian in the Chinese province of Liaoning. In 1938 he returned to Japan to attend elementary school, but his education was cut short by military conscription in 1944. Takemitsu described his experience of military service at such a young age, under the Japanese Nationalist government, as \\"... extremely bitter\\". Takemitsu first became really conscious of Western classical music during his term of military service, in the form of a popular French Song (\\"Parlez-moi d'amour\\") which he listened to with colleagues in secret, played on a gramophone with a makeshift needle fashioned from bamboo.  During the post-war U.S. occupation of Japan, Takemitsu worked for the U.S. Armed Forces, but was ill for a long period. Hospitalised and bed-ridden, he took the opportunity to listen to as much Western music as he could on the U.S. Armed Forces network. While deeply affected by these experiences of Western music, he simultaneously felt a need to distance himself from the traditional music of his native Japan. He explained much later, in a lecture at the New York International Festival of the Arts, that for him Japanese traditional music \\"always recalled the bitter memories of war\\".  Despite his almost complete lack of musical training, and taking inspiration from what little Western music he had heard, Takemitsu began to compose in earnest at the age of 16: \\"... I began [writing] music attracted to music itself as one human being. Being in music I found my raison d'etre as a man. After the war, music was the only thing. Choosing to be in music clarified my identity.\\" Though he studied briefly with Yasuji Kiyose beginning in 1948, Takemitsu remained largely self-taught throughout his musical career.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Tōru Takemitsu","rationale":"The given text gives the biography of Japanese composer and writer Tōru Takemitsu.

I fully understand that I am old enough to be living on my own, but to make a long story short, my mom struggles with mental health issues and I worry that if I leave her on her own, she’ll start living life in a very unhinged way. (she’s struggled with addiction in the past) \\n\\nI’m not going to make myself out to be a saint or anything like that, but I do help her out a lot around the house. For the past 5 years, I’ve been giving her daily assistance with learning the internet &amp; web browsing, a lot of which includes helping her with online shopping. She had a slight addiction for a minute and was ordering 5+ items from a multitude of shops and having me complete all the return/support tickets when she doesn’t like her items...which is almost always. \\n\\nI digress. I’m just trying to paint an accurate portrait of our give and take relationship. She’s on social assistance which pays for our rent. I’m grateful that she allows me to live here, but I do pay for most of my own food and things, and lately I’ve been going out of my way to pay for her meals and groceries as well. \\n\\nThis is where I get frustrated. I work about a 40 minute walk away from my house. It’s a 5 minute car ride. It’s freezing out right now, and taking the bus takes almost as long as walking since the schedules are wonky. \\n\\nI asked her if she’d mind dropping me off (since her days are always 100% free) and she says no. I asked her why not, and her reasoning was that her boyfriend is awake and might want to use the car in the 10 minutes she’d be gone. I told her I would really appreciate just a drop off and had full intentions of taking the bus home. Still no. \\n\\nShe very rarely gave me rides as kid—I relied on the bus for school &amp; hanging out, even in the winter. When I missed my school bus, I’d take a cab. \\n\\nI can drive, and I drive rather well... but I never have access to a car to practice, which is why I haven’t gotten my license yet. There’s always an excuse as to why I can’t use the car when I ask to practice/book a road test. \\n\\nSorry for the brick of text. I wanted to paint a proper picture before I ask:\\n\\nAm I an asshole for being annoyed that she won’t drive me 5 minutes up the road to work, but expects me to be on call for her tech support and questions 24/7 and bring her takeout/run various errands for her while I’m on foot &amp; she drives? \\n\\nI know the realistic response is to move out and get my own car... but my dad just passed away recently and I have a lot of psychological hangups/panic about losing my mom now. She takes very poor care of herself without my help, and I fear that if I leave her, she’ll let go altogether. \\n\\nI’m just bitter lately because I feel like she has no remorse asking me for a million things because she “puts a roof over my head” (technically the government does but whatever) but when I ask her to drop me off, it’s the end of the bloody world.","target":"no","rationale":"The author of the post is questioning whether or not a mother's refusal to drive 5 minutes up the road to take her daughter to work is considered unreasonable.\\n\\nIn the post, the author uses both past tense and present tense in describing their relationship with their mother.

He is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992). Carson received six Emmy Awards, the Television Academy's 1980 Governor's Award, and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987.\\nContext: Carson began his broadcasting career in 1950 at WOW radio and television in Omaha, Nebraska. Carson soon hosted a morning television program called The Squirrel's Nest. One of his routines involved interviewing pigeons on the roof of the local courthouse that would report on the political corruption they had seen. Carson supplemented his income by serving as master of ceremonies at local church dinners, attended by some of the same politicians and civic leaders whom he had lampooned on the radio.  The wife of one of the Omaha political figures Carson spoofed owned stock in a radio station in Los Angeles, and in 1951 referred Carson to her brother, who was influential in the emerging television market in southern California. Carson joined CBS-owned Los Angeles television station KNXT. In 1953, comic Red Skelton--a fan of Carson's \\"cult success\\" low-budget sketch comedy show, Carson's Cellar (1951 to 1953) on KNXT--asked Carson to join his show as a writer. In 1954, Skelton during rehearsal accidentally knocked himself unconscious an hour before his live show began, and Carson successfully filled in for him. In 1955, Jack Benny invited Carson to appear on one of his programs during the opening and closing segments. Carson imitated Benny and claimed that Benny had copied his gestures. Benny predicted that Carson would have a successful career as a comedian.  Carson hosted several shows besides Carson's Cellar, including the game show Earn Your Vacation (1954) and the CBS variety show The Johnny Carson Show (1955-1956). He was a guest panelist on the original To Tell the Truth starting in 1960, later becoming a regular panelist from 1961 until 1962. After the prime time The Johnny Carson Show failed, he moved to New York City to host Who Do You Trust? (1957-1962), formerly known as Do You Trust Your Wife?. In 1958, he appeared as a guest star in an episode entitled \\"Do You Trust Your Wife\\" on NBC's short-lived variety show, The Polly Bergen Show. On Who Do You Trust?, Carson met his future sidekick and straight man, Ed McMahon. Although he believed moving to daytime would hurt his career, Who Do You Trust? was a success. It was the first show where he could ad lib and interview guests, and because of Carson's on-camera wit, the show became \\"the hottest item on daytime television\\" during his five years at ABC.\\nQuestion: did he work with anyone else?.

Fram left Christiania on 24 June 1893, seen on her way by a cannon salute from the fort and the cheers of thousands of well-wishers. This was the first of a series of farewells as Fram sailed round the coast and moved northward, reaching Bergen on 1 July (where there was a great banquet in Nansen's honour), Trondheim on 5 July and Tromsø, north of the Arctic Circle, a week later.  The last Norwegian port of call was Vardø, where Fram arrived on 18 July.  After the final provisions were taken on board, Nansen, Sverdrup, Hansen and Blessing spent their last hours ashore in a sauna, being beaten with birch twigs by two young girls.The first leg of the journey eastward took Fram across the Barents Sea towards Novaya Zemlya and then to the North Russian settlement of Khabarova where the first batch of dogs was brought on board.  On 3 August Fram weighed anchor and moved cautiously eastward, entering the Kara Sea the next day. Few ships had sailed the Kara Sea before, and charts were incomplete. On 18 August, in the area of the Yenisei River delta, an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander. Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned. The crew also experienced the dead water phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by energy dissipation caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water. On 9 September a wide stretch of ice-free water opened up, and next day Fram rounded Cape Chelyuskin—the second ship to do so, after Nordenskiöld's... contains an answer for the question: What did the voyage heading to the New Siberian Islands decide to name the first uncharted island they discovered in August?, what is it ?","target":"Sverdrup Island","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"In August, they discovered an uncharted island which they named Sverdrup Island (after Fram's commander).\\""},{"source":"Given a math problem with context and a question and 5 answer choices, the task is to provide the correct answer choice based on the problem.

Complex I is composed of at least 46 structural subunits that are encoded in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Enzyme deficiency can result from either impaired catalytic efficiency or an inability to assemble the holoenzyme complex; however, the assembly process remains poorly understood. We have used two-dimensional Blue-Native/SDS gel electrophoresis and a panel of 11 antibodies directed against structural subunits of the enzyme to investigate complex I assembly in the muscle mitochondria from four patients with complex I deficiency caused by either mitochondrial or nuclear gene defects. Immunoblot analyses of second dimension denaturing gels identified seven distinct complex I subcomplexes in the patients studied, five of which could also be detected in nondenaturing gels in the first dimension. Although the abundance of these intermediates varied among the different patients, a common constellation of subcomplexes was observed in all cases. A similar profile of subcomplexes was present in a human/mouse hybrid fibroblast cell line with a severe complex I deficiency due to an almost complete lack of assembly of the holoenzyme complex. The finding that diverse causes of complex I deficiency produce a similar pattern of complex I subcomplexes suggests that these are intermediates in the assembly of the holoenzyme complex. We propose a possible assembly pathway for the complex, which differs significantly from that proposed for Neurospora, the current model for complex I assembly.","target":"Identification and characterization of a common set of complex I assembly intermediates in mitochondria from patients with complex I deficiency","rationale":"I suggest the following title: \\"Identification and characterization of a common set of complex I assembly intermediates in mitochondria from patients with complex I deficiency\\".

He attended and played baseball for Calumet High School (Chicago). After receiving no scholarship offers following graduation, Puckett at first went to work on an assembly line for Ford Motor Company. However, he was given a chance to attend Bradley University and after one year transferred to Triton College.\\n\\nIn 1991, the Twins got back on the winning track and Puckett led the way by batting .319, eighth in the league and Minnesota surged past Oakland midseason to capture the division title. The Twins then beat the Toronto Blue Jays in five games in the American League Championship Series as Puckett batted .429 with two home runs and five RBI to win the ALCS MVP.  The subsequent 1991 World Series was ranked by ESPN to be the best ever played, with four games decided on the final pitch and three games going into extra innings. The Twins and their opponent, the Atlanta Braves, had each finished last in their respective divisions in the year before winning their league pennant, something that had never happened before.  Going into Game 6, the Twins trailed three games to two with each team winning their respective home games. Puckett gave the Twins an early lead by driving in Chuck Knoblauch with a triple in the first inning. Puckett then made a leaping catch in front of the Plexiglass wall in left field to rob Ron Gant of an extra-base hit in the third. The game went into extra innings, and in the first at-bat of the bottom of the 11th, Puckett hit a dramatic game-winning home run on a 2-1 count off of Charlie Leibrandt to send the Series to Game 7. This dramatic game has been widely remembered as the high point in Puckett's career. The images of Puckett rounding the bases, arms raised in triumph (often punctuated by CBS television broadcaster Jack Buck saying \\"And we'll see you tomorrow night!\\"), are always included in video highlights of his career. After Game 6, the Twins replaced the blue seat back and bottom where the walk off home run ball was caught with a gold colored set. Both of these sets remain in the Twins' archives. The original home run seat armrests and hardware, as well as the replacement blue seat back and bottom, are now in a private collection of Puckett memorabilia in Minnesota after the Metrodome was torn down. The Twins then went on to win Game 7 1-0, with Jack Morris throwing a 10-inning complete game, and claimed their second World Series crown in five years.  However, the Twins did not make it back to the postseason during the rest of Puckett's career, although Puckett continued to play well. In 1994, Puckett was switched to right field and won his first league RBI title by driving in 112 runs.

In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies. Goldstein states that the government of Güshi Khan and the Dalai Lama persecuted the Karma Kagyu sect, confiscated their wealth and property, and even converted their monasteries into Gelug monasteries.

It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation.\\n\\n- Ossingen is a municipality in the district of Andelfingen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.\\n\\n- The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).\\n\\n- Husemersee ( or Hausersee ) is a lake at Ossingen in the Canton of Zurich , Switzerland . Its surface area is 8 ha .\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n- A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.\\n\\n- A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.\\n\\n- Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.\\n\\n- Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein.\\n\\n- A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\".\\n\\n- Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed.\\n\\n- A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.\\n\\n- The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\". With a population of 141,762 (November 2016), Bern is the fourth most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\\n\\n- Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. \\nThe country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.\\n\\n- A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\".\\n\\n- A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 48 such countries, including four partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World).\\n\\n- A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity.\\n\\n- Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world.

He refuses to go to the doctor for regular treatment or even when he’s ill.  When I say “in the hospital” it’s because he gets so fucking sick that his kids call 911 (they’re all grown adults BTW).  He does take insulin, but that’s as far as any self treatment goes.  He smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish.  I know lots of other people with diabetes, my aunt for example has never ever had to go to the doctor for complications due to diabetes, neither did my friend in high school (and he was 17 and an idiot), and neither does my CURRENT prep cook, who ALSO has diabetes.  Because they take care of themselves! My prep cook brings himself little sugar free cookies and bananas to work with him and eats these cactus tortillas bc they have less sugar than corn. So it’s increasingly frustrating to deal with his constant sickness, not because of the inconvenience to me and the business, I solved that with 2nd sous chef, but because we’re all watching this dude kill himself in front of us and he’s the most stubborn mother fucker in the world and it’s breaking my heart.\\n\\nOk, so last Friday I’m up in my office doing some paperwork and go into the kitchen to check on things and 1st sous is gone, 2nd sous says he got really sick and left an hour earlier.  No big deal, we’re extra staffed with a new guy training so I’m not worried about it and leave at my normal time.  Saturday 1st sous is a no show, I text and call, but as usual hear nothing.  2nd Sous coincidentally lives with 1st, so I ask him if he’s okay and he says he hasn’t talked to him that he was asleep when he got home the night before and was still sleeping when he left for work in the morning.  My days off are Sun. and Mon. and 2nd sous is going out of town to visit his fam for Thanksgiving, so I assume I’m going to be working on both of my days off to cover for 1st sous.  C’est le vie, they’re super slow days so boring, but no biggie.\\n\\nTuesday comes and 1st sous comes in to talk to me.  We go outside and he tells me he found a diabetic ulcer on his foot and that it started to “stink” on Sunday.  He refuses to go the doctor bc he knows they’re going to tell him to amputate.  His plan is to cut off the dead tissue himself, apparently he’s done this before (…) and his friend gave him some weird oil shit that’s supposed to kill the infection before it can get into his blood stream (I forgot to mention, he says he is allergic to all antibiotics) I try and talk him out of it and tell him prosthesis have improved, he’ll be able to do everything he can now, no one will even be able to tell, but he won’t even consider it because HE WON’T STOP DRINKING AND SMOKING.  Like it’s his fucking life blood, I was like, what?!  You won’t stop smoking to have more time with your kids?   And he shrugged and said he’s raised 5 good men and they don’t need him.  Basically he wants me to give him two weeks to “get back to normal.”  In my opinion, he is not going to get back to normal.  He is going to ignore this until he gets blood poisoning and dies.  I told him that I think he shouldn’t waste what time he has left working and that he should spend it with his kids and he said, yeah maybe.\\n\\nThis situation has been really stressful in a lot of ways, I really care about him and I obviously don’t want him to fucking die and he was crying telling me and I was crying and it was all very awful.  After our talk he went back inside and drank a whiskey while I input invoices, so what can ya do, he’s not going to change for anything including his own life.\\n\\nThe owner of my place told me that I can’t fire him over this.  I said I’m not going to watch him commit suicide in front of me and that’s not fucking fair to the staff and that it’s not doing him any favors allowing him to continue working.  Every step he takes will be pushing the infection into his bloodstream (I’m not a doctor, but I believe you’re supposed to “off weight”?) It might seem callous, but I really don’t want to let him back.  I honestly think it would be better to fire him because if he was unemployed he could get Medicaid, maybe hospice care, maybe die with some dignity instead of fainting in the bathroom at the bar after a long shift without eating.  Even in the event that he pulls off some sort of miraculous hobo surgery on himself and gets all the necrotic tissue out, how long until it happens again?  His kids are all moving away, 2nd sous is moving out of their house, who’s going to call 911 next time? I worried I'm being selfish.  One of my cooks pointed out that maybe he really really loves cooking and wants to die doing it.  Ummm, I love cooking too, but I certainly would not be working myself into a grave were I in this situation, I love other things more. \\n\\nSo, AITA?\\n\\nTL;DR Sous chef is dying from complications from diabetes, refuses medical help, is literally going to cut away parts of his own foot, and wants me to hold his job for him until he recovers.  I think firing him is for his own good, the owner says I shouldn’t, am I the asshole?","target":"RIGHT","rationale":"Despite the fact that his sous chef is dying, the author has been supportive of him and tried to help him.

Further, if he had fired his sous chef it would have caused him more stress and interfered with their relationship, which may have made an already bad situation worse for both parties involved.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to this question is \\"RIGHT\\" because it seems like there were no other ethical options available for this person at this time.\\""},{"source":"In this task, you are provided with an article of the legal acts.

Considered one of her best performances by Billboard, it triggered more than 214,000 interactions per minute globally on Facebook. She and Diane Warren co-wrote the song \\"Til It Happens to You\\" for the documentary The Hunting Ground, which earned them the Satellite Award for Best Original Song and an Academy Award nomination in the same category.

Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London.\\nNumerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","target":"Diego","rationale":"The given question is: What is the first name of the person who combined two established poses for Venus?\\nThe answer to this can be found in these sentences from the text: \\"Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus\\".

When the tide turns against him, he dons a tunic and a womanish wig (spira), apparently part of the same costume, and thus enjoys a reprieve, although this attire may not itself have been considered effeminate as it was also worn by the priests of Mars of whom Gracchus was the chief priest. The change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent. It is unusual to see a gladiator depicted this way in a satire, as such fighters usually take the role of men who are \\"brawny, brutal, sexually successful with women of both high and low status, but especially the latter, ill-educated if not uneducated, and none too bright intellectually.\\" The retiarius tunicatus in the satire is the opposite: \\"a mock gladiatorial figure, of equivocal sex, regularly dressed in costume of some sort, possibly usually as a woman, and matched against a secutor or murmillo in a mock gladiatorial exhibition.\\"Despite their low status, some retiarii became quite popular throughout the early Empire. The fact that spectators could see net-fighters' faces humanised them and probably added to their popularity. At Pompeii, graffiti tells of Crescens or Cresces the retiarius, \\"lord of the girls\\" and \\"doctor to nighttime girls, morning girls, and all the rest.\\" Evidence suggests that some homosexual men fancied gladiators, and the retiarius would have been particularly appealing. Roman art depicts net-men just as often as other types. A mosaic found in 2007 in a bathhouse at the Villa dei Quintili shows a retiarius named Montanus. The fact that his name is recorded indicates that the gladiator was famous. The mosaic dates to c. CE 130, when the Quintilii family had the home built; the emperor Commodus, who fought in gladiatorial bouts as a secutor, acquired the house in CE 182 and used it as a country villa.

They are sometimes called \\"red-tasseled Manchus\\", a reference to the ornamentation on traditional Manchu hats. The Later Jin (1616-1636), and Qing dynasty (1636-1912) were established by Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) in China. Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country.\\n\\nOctagonal drum is a type of Manchu folk art that was very popular among bannermen, especially in Beijing. It is said that octagonal drum originated with the snare drum of the Eight-banner military and the melody was made by the banner soldiers who were on the way back home from victory in the battle of Jinchuan. The drum is composed of wood surrounded by bells. The drumhead is made by wyrmhide with tassels at the bottom. The colors of the tassels are yellow, white, red, and blue, which represent the four colors of the Eight Banners. When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells. Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer.  \\"Zidishu\\" is the main libretto of octagonal drum and can be traced back to a type of traditional folk music called the \\"Manchu Rhythm\\". Although Zidishu was not created by Han Chinese, it still contains many themes from Chinese stories, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, Romance of the West Chamber, Legend of the White Snake and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Additionally, there are many works that depict the lives of Bannermen. Aisin Gioro Yigeng, who was pen named \\"Helu\\" and wrote the sigh of old imperial bodyguard, as the representative author. Zidishu involves two acts of singing, which are called dongcheng and xicheng.  After the fall of the Qing dynasty, the influence of the octagonal drum gradually reduced.

I was heartbroken and terribly lonely. I couldn't eat or sleep and cried all the time. Finally, realizing how much I missed my pony, my father bought me another horse, Cowboy.\\nCowboy was without doubt the ugliest horse in the world. But I didn't care. I loved him beyond all reasons.\\nI joined a riding club. When Cowboy and I entered the events where the horse was judged by appearance, we were quickly \\"shown the gate\\".

It was stated that the mongooses can adapt rapidly to different environments as long as there is no competition, so would it not be better to introduce competition or predators to control or manage the mongoose population, this should relive the pressure on the other species like the sea turtles. Cool Facts About The Large Grey Mongoose. The largest species of Mongoose in Africa, the Large Grey Mongoose, also commonly known as the Egyptian Mongoose, grows to nearly 90cm long with a 40cm long tail. They live in India, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Mongoose (herpestidae) can be found in Africa, Southern Asia and Iberian Peninsula. Mongoose were introduced to the … Hawaiian Islands, and West Indies. There are over 40 different species of Mongoose. Mongooses will live in various types of forest (tropical rainforest), dry grassland and near-deserts. They make burrows or take shelter in hollow logs or spaces within rock piles. This is when the mongoose leaps in to take a nip at the back of his enemy’s head. The duel ends when the snake is so tired he can strike no more. Then the mongoose gives a killing bite and starts his dinner. He begins with the snake's head. Fun facts about the King Cobra. 1  They are the only snake that builds nests for its eggs. The female will guard the eggs until they hatch. 2  Snake charmers in Asia often charm king cobras. The cobra is mesmerized by the shape and movement of the flute, not by the sound. 3  They live to around 20 years old. 4  Its conservation status is least concern. With virtually no natural predator in Hawaii, the mongoose population increased exponentially, from the original seventy-two to the thousands we have today. Unfortunately, as mongooses were alert during the day, and rats, at night, the former didn't really exterminate the latter. Since Hawai'i has no squirrels this must be our very own Rikky-Tikky-Tavi, the Small Asian Mongoose. Known also by it's Hawaiian name of 'Iole manakuke (or just manakuke), the word 'Iole means 'rat' and manakuke means mongoose. Mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) Regulatory Status: Hawaii Injurious Wildlife (HAR 124). It is against Hawaii State law for any person to introduce, keep or breed any mongoose within the State except by permit from HDOA; permits are not issued for Kauai County or the island of Lanai. The victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of foot, -- snake's blow against mongoose's jump, -- and as no eye can follow the motion of a snake's head when it strikes, that makes things much more wonderful than any magic herb.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying…\\nQuestion: When did the actor perform at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival?\\nAnswer:","target":"before auditioning in New York","rationale":"The question asks about the order in which events occurred.

When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461.\\n\\nIn 1485, following his death in battle against Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field, Richard III's body was buried in Greyfriars Church in Leicester.  Following the discoveries of Richard's remains in 2012, it was decided that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite feelings in some quarters that he should have been reburied in York Minster. His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and the Most Reverend Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. The British Royal Family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a distant relation of the king and later portrayed him in The Hollow Crown television series, read a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.  His cathedral tomb was designed by the architects van Heyningen and Haward. The tombstone is deeply incised with a cross, and consists of a rectangular block of white Swaledale fossil stone, quarried in North Yorkshire. It sits on a low plinth made of dark Kilkenny marble, incised with Richard's name, dates and motto (Loyaulte me lie - loyalty binds me). The plinth also carries his coat of arms in pietra dura. The remains of Richard III are in a lead-lined coffin, inside an outer English oak coffin crafted by Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of Richard's sister Anne of York, and laid in a brick-lined vault below the floor, and below the plinth and tombstone. The original 2010 raised tomb design had been proposed by Langley\`s \\"Looking For Richard Project\\" and fully funded by members of the Richard III Society.

In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies.

You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides.

His work is influential on most modern Jewish militant and far right-wing political groups. Kahane spent years reaching out to Jews through published works, weekly articles, speeches, and debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States, and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows.\\nContext: Martin David Kahane was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1932 to an Orthodox Jewish family. His father, Yechezkel (Charles) Kahane, the author of the \\"Torah Yesharah\\", studied at Polish and Czech yeshivas, was involved in the Revisionist Zionist movement, and was a close friend of Ze'ev Jabotinsky.  As a teenager, Kahane became an ardent admirer of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Peter Bergson, who were frequent guests in his parents' home, and he joined the Betar (Brit Trumpeldor) youth wing of Revisionist Zionism. He was active in protests against Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary who maintained restrictions on the immigration of Jews (even Nazi death camp survivors) to Palestine after the end of the Second World War. In 1947, Kahane was arrested for throwing eggs and tomatoes at Bevin, as the latter disembarked at Pier 84 on a visit to New York. A photo of the arrest appeared in the New York Daily News. In 1954, he became the mazkir (director) of Greater New York City's sixteen Bnei Akiva chapters.  Kahane's formal education included elementary school at the Yeshiva of Flatbush, and he attended high school at both Abraham Lincoln H.S. and the Brooklyn Talmudical Academy. Kahane received his rabbinical ordination from the Mir Yeshiva in Brooklyn, where he was especially admired by the head, Rabbi Abraham Kalmanowitz, and he began going by his Hebrew name, Meir. He was fully conversant in the Tanakh (Jewish Bible), the Talmud, the Midrash, and Jewish law.

The alike fruit flies are the first insects ever cloned, says the Canadian team that created them. The question everyone asks is why anyone would want to clone flies in the first place. She hopes that the insects , which are very easy to experiment with , will help to adjust the cloning process in other animals and even in humans, where the technique is being researched to aid production of therapeutic   stem cells.\\nIn cloning, the DNA-containing nucleus of an adult cell is injected into an egg whose own nucleus  has been removed. At the moment, the majority of cloned mice, sheep and other animals die before birth. It is thought this is because the adult DNA is not properly 'reprogrammed'.\\nUsing flies, researchers might discover genes that are important for this reprogramming, and that have matches in other animals. That is because it is relatively easy in flies to knock out the function of a single gene and then attempt cloning with these cells, which will test whether that gene is important. If such genes are confirmed, then in theory cloned mammalian embryos  might be grown in selected solutions that change the activity of those genes to improve the technique's success rate. Although some groups have attempted to clone insects before, Lloyd says this is the first time it has been successful. The team used a slight difference on the standard cloning process: they transferred nuclei taken from embryos rather than fully-grown adult cells. They sucked several nuclei (pl)out of developing fly embryos, and injected them into a fertilized  fly egg. From over 800 early attempts, they cloned five adult insects, the group reports in the journal Genetics.\\nQuestion: The failure of most cloned animals is due to   _  .\\n- the difference of other animals' genes\\n- the improper technique of clone\\n- the complex of other animals\\n- the improper rearrange of the adult gene","target":"the improper rearrange of the adult gene","rationale":"In this question, the article is discussing how cloning works and why most cloned animals die before birth. It states that adult DNA in a nucleus needs to be reprogrammed properly for an animal to grow normally. If it isn’t, then the majority of clones will not survive; hence mammals might need special solutions which change their genes so they can handle being cloned better. This means that the failure of most cloned animals is due to improper rearrangement of their gene sequence rather than external factors such as genetics or other outside sources (which would cause genetic differences).

More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters. Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.","target":"Afghanistan","rationale":"The question asks for the option that is not part of Canada's defense strategy.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians.

This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers.

It is believed that Hans promised to concede some stretches of Finnish lands to the Muscovite prince, although he did not bother to honour the agreement after he had been crowned King of Sweden at the close of the war. Pursuant to the agreement, Ivan III sent Princes Daniil Shchenya and Vasily Shuisky to lay siege to the Swedish castle of Viborg. The siege lasted for three months and ended when a castellan set his supply of powder on fire, thus \\"scaring the Muscovites out of their wits\\", as the Swedish records say . The following year Russian generals Vasily Kosoy and Andrey Chelyadnin severely devastated Swedish Finland as far as Hämeenlinna . Sten Sture the Elder, who was then at Turku , was enraged at the news of the Muscovite expedition and sent Svante Nilsson with 2,000 men to take Ivangorod, a new fortress which Ivan III had built to protect Russian Ingria against Livonian Knights. The fortress was taken without difficulty, but — as it was obviously impossible to defend it for a considerable period of time — Svante Nilsson proposed to hand it over to the Knights, an offer which they declined.

It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back.

For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a formation.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city.

She leaves Sunday and returns Wednesday. We were talking about her travel plans as I was anticipating I would be driving her to the airport. The airport is about 75mins from our home. \\n\\nShe told me her flight back on Wednesday would arrive at 4:00pm. That means I would have to leave work a couple hours early to be there to pick her up. I wasn’t sure of my schedule on Wednesday and if I had anything that would prevent me from leaving early. As I was thinking about it, I realized that this is a work trip for her. So she could expense any overnight parking expenses. So I asked her why she doesn’t drive herself, because it wouldn’t cost her anything and then I don’t have to worry about leaving work early. \\n\\nThis upset her. I could tell she did not like that idea.  It was one of the few times we have had a disagreements where we think the other person is being totally unreasonable. She said that driving herself and figuring out parking and trying to time it out causes her anxiety. It’s obviously easier for her if I drive her and can drop her off right at the terminal. She also knows that I would probably be able to adjust my work schedule without much effort. \\n\\nI think it’s unreasonable to ask me to drive 2.5 hrs round trip each day and leave work early when she can drive herself and park for free.  I’ve driven her to the airport numerous times but those were always personal trips. It makes sense to me to drive her to save $100+ dollars on parking.  Asking me to inconvenience myself in this way just doesn’t make sense.  She is not a particularly anxious person, so I understand it would cause her some stress, but it’s not going to cause a panic attack or serious distress. \\n\\nSo, am I the asshole?","target":"no","rationale":"The author's girlfriend is going on a work trip out of state. The author suggests that his girlfriend should drive herself to the airport, which will save them money and prevent the author from having to leave work early to pick her up.

During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \\"Badami Chalukyas\\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century.\\nThe rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \\"Chalukyan architecture\\".

He was a leader of the nationalist movement in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) who served in a variety of cabinet positions in the decades following independence.\\nContext: Born to a prominent Ceylonese family with a strong association with the legal profession, Jayewardene was the eldest of 11 children, of Hon. Justice Eugene Wilfred Jayewardene KC, a Chief Justice of Ceylon and Agnes Helen Don Philip Wijewardena daughter of Tudugalage Muhandiram Don Philip Wijewardena a wealthy merchant. His younger brothers included Dr Hector Wilfred Jayewardene, QC and Dr Rolly Jayewardene, FRCP. His uncles were the Colonel Theodore Jayewarden, Justice Valentine Jayewardene and the Press Baron D. R. Wijewardena.  Raised by an English nanny, he received his primary education at Bishop's College, Colombo and attended Royal College, Colombo for his secondary education. At Royal College he played for the college cricket team, debuting in the Royal-Thomian series in 1925, and captained the rugby team at the annual \\"Royal-Trinity Encounter\\" (which later became known as the Bradby Shield Encounter). Excelling in both studies, sports and Club and Societies He was the first Chairman/Secretary in Royal College Social Services League in 1921 and he became the head prefect in 1925 and also represented the school in football and boxing; he was also a member of the cadet corps. He would later serve as the Secretary of the Royal College Union.  Jayewardene entered the University College, Colombo (University of London), in 1926 to read English, Latin, Logic and Economics; he attained a distinguished academic record and showed a keen interest in sports. In 1928 he transferred law by entering Colombo Law College and passed out as an advocate, starting his practice in the unofficial bar, for a brief period.

The overall mean duration of infertility for these women was 5.68 +/- 0.33 years (mean +/- standard error) and their mean age was 30.20 +/- 0.46 years. Fifty-two of these women had primary infertility. Three treatment protocols were evaluated. Twenty-five women with unexplained infertility (Group A) received low-dose bromocriptine (1.25 to 2.5 mg) at bedtime for the first 18 days of the cycle; 18 women with unexplained infertility (group B) received 100 mg of pyridoxine continuously; and 16 women receiving clomiphene citrate (group C) also received bromocriptine in a manner similar to that for group A. All subjects were followed for six treatment cycles or until pregnancy occurred. The estimated cumulative pregnancy rate after six treatment cycles was 65% for groups A and C, which is significantly higher than the 22% rate for group B (Lee-Desu statistic = 4.66, P = 0.03). Women treated with bromocriptine were 2.3 times more likely to conceive than women treated with pyridoxine. Furthermore, those infertile galactorrheic women whose random prolactin level was greater than or equal to 15 ng/ml were most likely to conceive. Expressible galactorrhea in women with unexplained infertility and high normal prolactin concentrations may serve as a clinical sign indicating those women who may benefit from low-dose bromocriptine treatment administered at bedtime.","target":"Adult","rationale":"The abstract describes a study that evaluated the effect of different treatment protocols on pregnancy rates among women with unexplained infertility.

Therefore, all the subjects in this study were adults.

Since oceans are vast bodies of water with humidity levels varying by location, they can be expected to have moderate amounts of moisture compared to thick clouds of dense pollution-filled smoke produced by fires.

The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna.\\nResidents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces.

This problem becomes more evident in tasks where the information needed to correctly solve them exist over long time scales, because EVGP prevents important gradient components from being back-propagated adequately over a large number of steps. We introduce a simple stochastic algorithm (\\\\textit{h}-detach) that is specific to LSTM optimization and targeted towards addressing this problem. Specifically, we show that when the LSTM weights are large, the gradient components through the linear path (cell state) in the LSTM computational graph get suppressed. Based on the hypothesis that these components carry information about long term dependencies (which we show empirically), their suppression can prevent LSTMs from capturing them. Our algorithm\\\\footnote{Our code is available at https://github.com/bhargav104/h-detach. } prevents gradients flowing through this path from getting suppressed, thus allowing the LSTM to capture such dependencies better. We show significant improvements over vanilla LSTM gradient based training in terms of convergence speed, robustness to seed and learning rate, and generalization using our modification of LSTM gradient on various benchmark datasets.","target":"A simple algorithm to improve optimization and handling of long term dependencies in LSTM","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nA simple algorithm to improve optimization and handling of long term dependencies in LSTM."},{"source":"Read the following context and choose the best option to answer the question.\\nContext: Well kind of , went to bed at like 3:30 .

The ground was rich with smells. Even in the high-class housing area where we were working, the stones held traces of many sole and confusing scents (smells). As I searched for the scent that would give me a clue to the tail of the guilty man, my tail wagged slowly, thoughtfully, delightedly.

I had to pick out one scent among the many that lay about and then tracked it to its source.\\n\\"You're wasting your time,\\" said the caretaker. I looked at him without raising my head. He was running his hand over his fat stomach. His rough palm and smooth shirt combined to make a slight noise. It was part of my training to be aware--often it is only a little whisper of a noise that alerts you to be drawing of a weapon. But of course the aging caretaker was going to do no such thing. There was no smell of fear or nervousness about him. He was merely being clever and talkative.\\n\\"I've seen many tracker-dogs in my time,\\" said the caretaker to the onlookers. I served with the police years ago. We would never have thought of using a tracker-dog to find a car thief. Impossible. Everyone knows that dogs are useless in such matters.\\nIn a sense he was right. I'm sure there's no need to tell you that, just as a dog's hearing is much better than a human being's, so his sense of smell tells one thing from another far better than a great detective.

The Gonzagas had enlarged their realm with Monferrato after receiving it in dowry from the wife of duke Frederick II Gonzaga. On 22 September 1612, Francis IV, Duke of Mantua and Monferrato died at the age of 26. His death occurred only a couple of months after the death of his father Vincent I, Duke of Mantua. He left only a three-year-old daughter, Maria of Mantua. Francis IV also had two younger brothers who, both being cardinals, could not marry and were thus ineligible to succeed to Mantua's throne. Nonetheless, Francis' two brothers, Ferdinando I  and Vincenzo II , eventually did become Dukes of Mantua. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children. A crisis erupted when Vincenzo II died on 26 December 1627 at the age of 33, the same day that his niece Maria Gonzaga's marriage with Charles de Nevers was celebrated.

On a rainy, windy night, Seattle started off strong with RB Shaun Alexander getting a three-yard TD run for the only score of the first quarter. The 49ers offense was almost nonexistent in the first half, as seven of San Francisco's first eight drives ended in three-and-outs. However, the Seahawks still allowed a 39-yard field goal by Niners kicker Joe Nedney near the end of the half. After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle's defense started giving way.  49ers QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Davis combined with an excellent kickoff return by Nate Burleson gave Seattle prime field position at the San Francisco 33-yard line. However, the Seahawks failed to convert on a fourth down play on the first series from scrimmage, and turned the ball over on downs. Smith would take advantage by driving his team downfield and completing a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore. San Francisco delivered the final blow with Smith running for an 18-yard TD on a naked bootleg with no defenders near him. The Seahawks got a 22-yard touchdown from QB Matt Hasselbeck to TE Jerramy Stevens with under two minutes left, but it wouldn't be enough as Seattle would get swept by the 49ers.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track.

However, since gradient descent is not applicable to hard-threshold functions, it is not clear how to learn them in a principled way. We address this problem by observing that setting targets for hard-threshold hidden units in order to minimize loss is a discrete optimization problem, and can be solved as such. The discrete optimization goal is to find a set of targets such that each unit, including the output, has a linearly separable problem to solve. Given these targets, the network decomposes into individual perceptrons, which can then be learned with standard convex approaches. Based on this, we develop a recursive mini-batch algorithm for learning deep hard-threshold networks that includes the popular but poorly justified straight-through estimator as a special case. Empirically, we show that our algorithm improves classification accuracy in a number of settings, including for AlexNet and ResNet-18 on ImageNet, when compared to the straight-through estimator.","target":"We learn deep networks of hard-threshold units by setting hidden-unit targets using combinatorial optimization and weights by convex optimization, resulting in improved performance on ImageNet","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe learn deep networks of hard-threshold units by setting hidden-unit targets using combinatorial optimization and weights by convex optimization, resulting in improved performance on ImageNet."},{"source":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the full names of the people Carl tracks down after leaving the hospital?, using the article: In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs.

It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.\\n\\n- Noise music is a category of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise within a musical context. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound. Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles and sound-based creative practices that feature noise as a primary aspect. It can feature acoustically or electronically generated noise, and both traditional and unconventional musical instruments. It may incorporate live machine sounds, non-musical vocal techniques, physically manipulated audio media, processed sound recordings, field recording, computer-generated noise, stochastic process, and other randomly produced electronic signals such as distortion, feedback, static, hiss and hum. There may also be emphasis on high volume levels and lengthy, continuous pieces. More generally noise music may contain aspects such as improvisation, extended technique, cacophony and indeterminacy, and in many instances conventional use of melody, harmony, rhythm and pulse is dispensed with.\\n\\n- Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. \\n\\n- Teenage Jesus and the Jerks were an influential American no wave band, based in New York City, who formed part of the city's no wave movement.\\n\\n- Atonality in its broadest sense is music that lacks a tonal center, or key. \\"Atonality\\", in this sense, usually describes compositions written from about 1908 to the present day where a hierarchy of pitches focusing on a single, central tone is not used, and the notes of the chromatic scale function independently of one another . More narrowly, the term \\"atonality\\" describes music that does not conform to the system of tonal hierarchies that characterized classical European music between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries . \\"The repertory of atonal music is characterized by the occurrence of pitches in novel combinations, as well as by the occurrence of familiar pitch combinations in unfamiliar environments\\" .\\n\\n- Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.\\n\\n- No wave was a short-lived avant-garde scene that emerged in the late 1970s in downtown New York City. In part a reaction against punk rock's recycling of traditionalist rock cliches, no wave musicians instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to a variety of non-rock genres, often reflecting an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview. In the later years of the scene, it adopted a more playful, danceable aesthetic inspired by disco, early hip hop, and world music sources.\\n\\n- Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") \\n\\n- A psychedelic drug is a drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'raccoo-oo-oon'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- action\\n - art\\n - aspect\\n - band\\n - city\\n - classical music\\n - cognition\\n - color\\n - concept\\n - contemporary art\\n - culture\\n - discourse\\n - drug\\n - electronics\\n - emphasis\\n - field\\n - genre\\n - human\\n - hybrid\\n - machine\\n - may\\n - melody\\n - music\\n - noise\\n - part\\n - people\\n - perception\\n - psychedelic drug\\n - radical\\n - raga\\n - range\\n - rock\\n - scene\\n - sense\\n - set\\n - society\\n - sound art\\n - style\\n - system\\n - the city\\n - variety\\n - volume\\n - wave","target":"band","rationale":"The passage is about a band, Raccoo-oo-oon.

The COPE (Caring for Older PEople) multidimensional assessment tool is designed to help community health workers (CHWs) identify clinically significant impairments and deliver evidence-based interventions   METHODS Older people (n = 150) identified by CHWs as frail or dependent, were assessed at home by the CHW using the structured COPE assessment tool, generating information on impairments in nutrition, mobility, vision, hearing, continence, cognition, mood and behaviour. The older people were reassessed by local physicians who reached a clinical judgment regarding the presence or absence of the same impairments based upon clinical examination guided by the EASY-Care assessment tool.   \\n RESULTS The COPE tool was considered easy to administer, and gave CHWs a sense of empowerment to understand and act upon the needs of older people. Agreement between COPE assessment by CHW and clinician assessors was modest (ranged from 45.8 to 91.3 %) for most impairments. However, the prevalence of impairments was generally higher according to clinicians, particularly for visual impairment (98.7 vs 45.8 %), cognitive impairment (78.4 vs. 38.2 %) and depression (82.0 vs. 59.9 %). Most cases identified by WHO-COPE were clinician confirmed (positive predictive values - 72.2 to 98.5 %), and levels of disability and needs for care among those identified by COPE were higher than those additionally identified by the clinician alone.   \\n CONCLUSIONS The COPE is a feasible tool for the identification of specific impairments in frail dependent older people in the community. Those identified are likely to be confirmed as having clinically relevant problems by clinicians working in the same service, and the COPE may be particularly effective at targeting attention upon those with the most substantial unmet needs.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract starts by introducing the research topic in the first sentence.

He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of life classes at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the \\"hearties\\" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the \\"aesthetes\\" had a largely homosexual membership. Lancaster followed his elder contemporary Kenneth Clark in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set. He cultivated the image of an Edwardian dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly. He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don Maurice Bowra; Lancaster's friend James Lees-Milne commented, \\"Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip.\\" Lancaster's undergraduate set included Stephen Spender, Randolph Churchill, and most importantly John Betjeman, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.Lancaster tried rowing with the Oxford University Boat Club, but quickly discovered that he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school.

The ability to use biological agents in warfare is prohibited by the Biological and Toxin Weapon Convention. Bioterrorism is defined as the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria or other agents used to cause illness or death in people, but also in animals or plants. It is aimed at creating casualties, terror, societal disruption, or economic loss, inspired by ideological, religious or political beliefs. The success of bioterroristic attempts is defined by the measure of societal disruption and panic, and not necessarily by the sheer number of casualties. Thus, making only a few individuals ill by the use of crude methods may be sufficient, as long as it creates the impact that is aimed for. The assessment of bioterrorism threats and motives have been described before. Biocrime implies the use of a biological agent to kill or make ill a single individual or small group of individuals, motivated by revenge or the desire for monetary gain by extortion, rather than by political, ideological, religious or other beliefs. The likelihood of a successful bioterrorist attack is not very large, given the technical difficulties and constraints. However, even if the number of casualties is likely to be limited, the impact of a bioterrorist attack can still be high.
