His group was managed by John \\"Monopoly\\" Johnson, Don Crowley, and Happy Lewis under the management firm Hustle Period. After attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances, The Go-Getters released their first and only studio album World Record Holders in 1999.

As an infant, Innocent was dumped at the farm during a violent storm, by a stranger who explained he had to keep going but feared endangering the child. He promised to return, but never did, instead sending money every six months. Jocelyn reveals this in a deathbed confession. After his death, Innocent receives a visit from her birth mother, Lady Blythe. A shallow and pretentious noblewoman, she explains that Innocent was the result of a fling she'd had with artist Pierce Armitage. He was probably the one who left her at the farm. Innocent departs for London, planning to earn her living by writing and \\"make a name\\" for herself, since she has none by birthright. She has one book already written; it's wildly successful, and she writes another. In the usual Corellian coincidences, Innocent's landlady had had a serious relationship with Pierce Armitage, and Lord Blythe had been his friend at school. Lady Blythe confesses all, then dies.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage:\\nThe severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots.\\nThe very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin.\\nIn order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment.\\nAfter cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.\\n\\nAfter gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them.\\nQuestion: What effect does Australian sun have on the skin?\\nOptions:\\n- a few cases of skin damage\\n- skin is well toned\\n- not enough information\\n- many cases of skin damage","target":"many cases of skin damage","rationale":"The context mentions that the Australian sun causes a multitude of cases of skin damage. The word \\"multitude\\" indicates a large number, so it can be concluded that there are many cases of skin damage caused by the sun in Australia.\\nTherefore, based on this information, we can infer that choice D (\\"many cases of skin damage\\") is correct and provides the best answer to our question."},{"source":"Article: After being lit at the birthplace of the Olympic Games in Olympia, Greece on March 24, the torch traveled to the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on March 31.

The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \\"Cathar antipope\\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia. The same year, Ban Matthew Ninoslav abandoned an unspecified heresy, but this did not satisfy Gregory.\\n\\nHow many years after Pope Honorius III to preached a crusade was the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia replaced?","target":"8","rationale":"Pope Honorius III preached a crusade against the Bosnian heretics in 1221.

Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side.

For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult.\\nHere’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up.

The areas that form the Assyrian homeland are parts of present-day northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran and, more recently, northeastern Syria. Moreover, the area that had the greatest concentration of Assyrians in the world until recently, is located in the Assyrian Triangle, a region which comprises the Nineveh plains, southern Hakkari and the Barwari regions. This is where some Assyrian groups seek to create an independent nation state.\\n\\nBoth Syriac Christianity and the Eastern Aramaic language came under pressure following the Arab Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century, and Assyrian Christians throughout the Middle Ages were subjected to Arabizing superstrate influence. The Assyrians suffered a significant persecution with the religiously motivated large scale massacres conducted by the Muslim Turco-Mongol ruler Tamurlane in the 14th century AD. It was from this time that the ancient city of Assur was abandoned by Assyrians, and Assyrians were reduced to a minority within their ancient homeland.  A Schism occurred in 1552 AD, when a number of Assyrian Christians entered communion with the Roman Catholic Church, which, after initially naming their new followers The Church of Assyria and Mosul, coined the term Chaldean Catholic in 1683 AD, giving rise to the modern Chaldean Catholic Church by 1830 AD. This term is purely theological however, the Assyrian Chaldean Catholics having no historical, ethnic, cultural or geographic link to the ancient inhabitants of Chaldea in south east Mesopotamia, who had disappeared into the native population of Babylonia by the 6th century BC.  Upper Mesopotamia had an established structure of dioceses by AD 500 following the introduction of Christianity from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD. After the fall of the Neo Assyrian Empire by 605 BC Assyria remained an entity for over 1200 years under Babylonian, Achamaenid Persian, Seleucid Greek, Parthian, Roman and Sassanid Persian rule. It was only after the Arab-Islamic conquest of the second half of the 7th century AD that Assyria as a named region was dissolved.  The mountainous region of the Assyrian homeland, Barwari, was part of the diocese of Beth Nuhadra (current day Dohuk) since antiquities and have seen a mass migration of Nestorians after the fall of Baghdad in 1258 and Timurlane's invasion from central Iraq. Its Christian inhabitants were little affected by the Ottoman conquests, however starting from the 19th century Kurdish Emirs sought to expand their territories at their expense. In the 1830s Muhammad Rawanduzi, the Emir of Soran, tried to forcibly add the region to his dominion pillaging many Assyrian villages. Bedr Khan Beg of Bohtan renewed attacks on the region in the 1840s, killing tens of thousands of Assyrians in Barwari and Hakkari before being ultimately defeated by the Ottomans.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Assyrian homeland","rationale":"The text is about the Assyrian homeland, which contains regions of present day northern Iraq and Turkey."},{"source":"In this task, we ask you to write an answer to a question that involves “event duration\\", based on a given sentence.

Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (251-183 BC), specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \\"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\\".\\n\\nA revival opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on April 4, 1972 and closed on August 12, 1972 after 156 performances. Directed by co-author Burt Shevelove the cast starred Phil Silvers as Pseudolus (later replaced by Tom Poston), Lew Parker as Senex, Carl Ballantine as Lycus and Reginald Owen as Erronius. Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. \\"Pretty Little Picture\\" and \\"That'll Show Him\\" were dropped from the show, and were replaced with \\"Echo Song\\" (sung by Hero and Philia), and \\"Farewell\\" (added for Nancy Walker as Domina, as she and Senex depart for the country). \\"Echo Song\\" and \\"Farewell\\" had been added to a production staged in Los Angeles the previous year and were composed by Sondheim. They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden.  The musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the St. James Theatre on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred Nathan Lane as Pseudolus (replaced by Whoopi Goldberg and later by David Alan Grier), Mark Linn-Baker as Hysterium, Ernie Sabella as Lycus, Jim Stanek as Hero, Lewis J. Stadlen as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by Jerry Zaks, with choreography by Rob Marshall. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Dramas Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical.  Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999.

Unknown solute(s) retained in renal failure have been extracted from uremic fluids. When added to normal plasma they induce a similar binding defect. Similar activity can be extracted from normal urine. We have devised a series of extraction and purification techniques that yielded three binding inhibitory ligands from normal human urine in sufficient quantity and of a high degree of purity. Rigorous methods have been applied to determine chemical identity of the ligands. Purification steps consisted of: adsorption at pH 3.0 to polystyrene-divinylbenzene resin (XAD-2); elution from the resin with methanol followed by drying and solution in dilute formic acid; passage through SP-Sephadex to remove cations, especially yellow-brown pigments; adsorption to the anion exchanger QAE-Sephadex, and separation into three zones of inhibitory activity with a formic acid gradient; purification to homogeneity with C-8 or C-18 silica reversed-phase chromatography. Using this isolation procedure, followed by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have shown that the binding inhibitory activity is due not to one ligand, but to a family of aromatic acids.

In June 2007 , AMD released low - voltage variants of their low - end 65 nm Athlon 64 X2 , named \`\` Athlon X2 '' . The Athlon X2 processors feature reduced TDP of 45 W. The name was also used for K10 based budget CPUs with two cores deactivated .\\n\\n- Pentium is a brand used for a series of x86-compatible microprocessors produced by Intel since 1993. In its current form, Pentium processors are considered entry-level products that Intel rates as \\"two stars\\", meaning that they are above the low-end Atom and Celeron series but below the faster Core i3, i5 and i7 lines as well as the high-end Xeon processors.\\n\\n- x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.\\n\\n- Intel Corporation (also known as Intel, stylized as intel) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California (colloquially referred to as \\"Silicon Valley\\") that was founded by Gordon Moore (of Moore's law fame) and Robert Noyce. It is the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue, and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors: the processors found in most personal computers (PCs). Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo (formerly IBM), HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.\\n\\n- 3DNow! is an extension to the x86 instruction set developed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It adds single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions to the base x86 instruction set, enabling it to perform vector processing, which improves the performance of many graphic-intensive applications. The first microprocessor to implement 3DNow was the AMD K6-2, which was introduced in 1998. When the application was appropriate this raised the speed by about 2-4 times.\\n\\n- Pentium 4 was a line of single-core central processing units (CPUs) for desktops, laptops and entry-level servers introduced by Intel on November 20, 2000 and shipped through August 8, 2008. They had a seventh-generation x86 (32-bit) microarchitecture, called NetBurst, which was the company's first all-new design since the introduction of the P6 microarchitecture of the Pentium Pro CPUs in 1995. NetBurst differed from P6 (Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds. Intel claimed that NetBurst would allow clock speeds of up to 10 GHz in future chips; however, severe problems with heat dissipation (especially with the Prescott Pentium 4) limited CPU clock speeds to a much lower 3.8 GHz.\\n\\n- The Athlon 64 is an eighth-generation, AMD64-architecture microprocessor produced by AMD, released on September 23, 2003. It is the third processor to bear the name \\"Athlon\\", and the immediate successor to the Athlon XP. The second processor (after the Opteron) to implement AMD64 architecture and the first 64-bit processor targeted at the average consumer, it was AMD's primary consumer microprocessor, and competes primarily with Intel's Pentium 4, especially the \\"Prescott\\" and \\"Cedar Mill\\" core revisions. It is AMD's first K8, eighth-generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers. Despite being natively 64-bit, the AMD64 architecture is backward-compatible with 32-bit x86 instructions. Athlon 64s have been produced for Socket 754, Socket 939, Socket 940 and Socket AM2. The line was succeeded by the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon X2 lines.\\n\\n- SSE3, Streaming SIMD Extensions 3, also known by its Intel code name Prescott New Instructions (PNI), is the third iteration of the SSE instruction set for the IA-32 (x86) architecture. Intel introduced SSE3 in early 2004 with the Prescott revision of their Pentium 4 CPU. In April 2005, AMD introduced a subset of SSE3 in revision E (Venice and San Diego) of their Athlon 64 CPUs. The earlier SIMD instruction sets on the x86 platform, from oldest to newest, are MMX, 3DNow! (developed by AMD), SSE and SSE2.\\n\\n- SSE2 (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2), is one of the Intel SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) processor supplementary instruction sets first introduced by Intel with the initial version of the Pentium 4 in 2001. It extends the earlier SSE instruction set, and is intended to fully replace MMX. Intel extended SSE2 to create SSE3 in 2004. SSE2 added 144 new instructions to SSE, which has 70 instructions. Competing chip-maker AMD added support for SSE2 with the introduction of their Opteron and Athlon 64 ranges of AMD64 64-bit CPUs in 2003.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'athlon 64 x2' with the relationship of 'designer'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- advanced micro devices\\n - ibm\\n - intel","target":"advanced micro devices","rationale":"The Athlon 64 X2 is the first dual-core desktop CPU designed by AMD.

Mike now needs to figure out how the predator prey relationship balance the ecosystem.\\n\\nHint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.","target":"increase","rationale":"As the question describes, species A is a predator and species B is its prey. Species C is plant that grows on which species B lives. \\nIf there are more predators (species A) in an area then they will eat their prey at a faster rate than normally happens causing the population of their prey (in this case, species B) to decrease. When fewer members of species B exist due to being eaten by predators belonging to species A, less food exists for them as well because it comes from eating only plants belonging to specie C; therefore if there were fewer animals within the ecosystem who ate grasses of specie C, then these would increase over time since they have not been consumed at all or rapidly enough."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

However, the Browns' ended the day with a 34-7 loss to the Steelers. A number of Browns errors gave Pittsburgh opportunities to take a first quarter lead. After being stopped on their first possession, the Browns were forced to punt. Paul Ernster fumbled the snap, which resulted in a poor kick, and the Browns were called for four penalties on the play. The Steelers took possession on the Browns' 22-yard line and scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Ben Ben Roethlisberger to Hines Ward. On the Browns' next possession, Charlie Frye threw an interception to Deshea Townsend, which eventually led to the Steelers' second score of the game, a 26-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. The Brown next possession ended when Jamal Lewis fumbled the ball at the Browns' 40-yard line. The Steelers quickly converted the turnover, with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes on the next play to bring the score to 17-0. After being sacked five times and throwing for only 34&#160;yards on 4-of-10 passing, Frye was removed from the game and was replaced by second-string quarterback Derek Anderson. In the second quarter, Willie Parker fumbled the ball and gave the Browns possession. However, the team was forced to punt, and just two drives later, the Browns fumbled the ball again - this time on a sack by Ryan Clark of Anderson. The Browns were able to hold the Steelers scoreless through the second quarter as Roethlisberger failed to connect on his last six pass attempts of the quarter. However, the Steelers also held the Browns scoreless, and the teams entered halftime with the Steelers ahead 17-0. The second half began well for the Steelers, with an eight-play, 71-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie Matt Spaeth. The Browns countered with a long drive of 76&#160;yards that ended with a one-yard touchdown pass from Anderson to second-year fullback Lawrence Vickers, cutting the deficit to 24-7. However, this would be the Browns' only score of the game. On the next drive, the Steelers answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Heath Miller, giving the Steelers a 31-7 advantage. The Browns punted on their next possession, and the Steelers capped an eight-minute drive with a 31-yard field goal by Reed, giving the Steelers a 34-7 lead, which they never surrendered. On the Browns' next offensive possession, Braylon Edwards dropped a pass from Anderson, which was ruled a fumble. Following a Steelers punt, Anderson threw an interception to Ike Taylor on a pass intended for Edwards, and Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch ran the clock out, securing the win. The loss put the Browns record at 0-1, and allowed the Steelers to take a one-game lead in the overall series, 56 wins to 55. Following the game, head coach Romeo Crennel stated that he didn't know who would start at quarterback in the next game versus the Cincinnati Bengals. He also stood by his decision not to insert rookie Brady Quinn into the game, even after chants were heard from the home crowd hoping otherwise. On Tuesday, September 11, the Browns traded Frye, who was expected to start against the Bengals in week two, to the Seattle Seahawks for a sixth-round draft choice. The Browns are the first team since 1970 to trade their starting quarterback before Week 2. The team's general manager, Phil Savage, stated that Anderson was to be named the team's new starting quarterback, with Quinn moving up the depth chart to be Anderson's backup.

Ten Holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM) and were killed 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation. Twenty-four hours before the calves were killed, 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously. The components of the tissue valves, i.e., three leaflets and sewing rings, were separated. Each leaflet was cut into four sections: free edge, central zone, flexion zone, and attachment zone. From the radioactivity in blood, leaflet zones, sewing rings, area of leaflet zones, platelet count, and fibrinogen level in blood, the mean regional density of adherent platelets, fibrinogen-fibrin, and fibrinogen/platelet were calculated. The density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation. The number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones, suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve.","target":"Animal","rationale":"The study focuses on platelet and fibrinogen deposition on the leaflets and sewing rings of mitral valves in 10 Holstein calves (i.e., animals).

Both sides had fortified their principal towns, the French at Plaisance on the western side of the Avalon Peninsula, the English at St. John's on Conception Bay. During King William's War, d'Iberville had destroyed most of the English communities in 1696-97, and the island again became a battleground in 1702. In August of that year, an English fleet under the command of Commodore John Leake descended on the outlying French communities but made no attempts on Plaisance. During the winter of 1705, Plaisance's French governor Daniel d'Auger de Subercase retaliated, leading a combined French and Mi'kmaq expedition that destroyed several English settlements and unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John's. The French and their Indian allies continued to harry the English throughout the summer and did damages to the English establishments claimed at £188,000. The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island's northern coasts. In December 1708, a combined force of French, Canadian, and Mi'kmaq volunteers captured St. John's and destroyed the fortifications. They lacked the resources to hold the prize, however, so they abandoned it, and St. John's was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709.

When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents, though there is little to support this claim. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.\\n\\nThe Buddhist, Jain and Hindu archaeological sites in Odisha state, particularly the Assia range of hills show inscriptions and carvings of dances that are dated to the 6th to 9th century CE. Important sites include the Ranigumpha in Udaygiri, and various caves and temples at Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri and Alatgiri sites. The Buddhist icons, for example, are depicted as dancing gods and goddesses, with Haruka, Vajravarahi, and Marichi in Odissi-like postures. Historical evidence, states Alexandra Carter, shows that Odissi Maharis (Hindu temple dancers) and dance halls architecture (nata-mandap) were in vogue at least by the 9th century CE.  According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the Kalpasutra of Jainism, in its manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, includes classical Indian dance poses - such as the Samapada, the Tribhangi and the Chuaka of Odissi. This, states Vatsyayan, suggests that Odissi was admired or at least well known in distant parts of India, far from Odisha in the medieval era, to be included in the margins of an important Jain text. However, the Jain manuscripts use the dance poses as decorative art in the margins and cover, but do not describe or discuss the dance. Hindu dance texts such as the Abhinaya Chandrika and Abhinaya Darpana provide a detailed description of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the Karanas mentioned in NatyaShastra. Similarly, the illustrated Hindu text on temple architecture from Odisha, the Shilpaprakasha, deals with Odia architecture and sculpture, and includes Odissi postures.  Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples, dated to be from the 10th to 14th century, show Odissi dance. This is evidenced in Jagannath temple in Puri, as well as other temples of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vedic deities such as Surya (Sun) in Odisha. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians in Konark Sun Temple and Brahmeswara Temple in Bhubaneswar.  The composition of the poetic texts by 8th century Shankaracharya and particularly of divine love inspired Gitagovinda by 12th century Jayadeva influenced the focus and growth of modern Odissi. Odissi was performed in the temples by the dancers called Maharis, who played out these spiritual poems and underlying religious plays, after training and perfecting their art of dance starting from an early age, and who were revered as auspicious to religious services.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Anything else interesting?","target":"Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples,","rationale":"From the given context, it clearly seems that the answer is: Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples,"},{"source":"The Legal Services Corp.

If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take.

It appears that we — or at least our ancestors — were at least partially responsible for their extinction. About 45,000 years ago, Neanderthal numbers were dwindling. They are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains, a new study suggests. Instead, it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, scientists believe.

Until about 40,000 years ago, a blink in geologic time, at least one close relative was sharing this planet with us. They were Neanderthals, native Eurasians that today are recovering from their reputation as brutes thanks to scientific findings that have rediscovered them as a species similar to ours in many respects. Neanderthals were a separate species from modern humans, and became extinct (because of climate change or interaction with modern humans) and were replaced by modern humans moving into their habitat between 45,000 and 40,000 years ago.

As they passed Panaon Island, Nishimura's force ran into a trap set for them by the U.S.-Australian 7th Fleet Support Force. R. Adm. Jesse Oldendorf had six battleships, four heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, 29 destroyers and 39 PT boats. To pass the strait and reach the landings, Nishimura had to run the gauntlet. At about 03:00 the Japanese battleship Fusō and three destroyers were hit by torpedoes and Fusō broke in two. At 03:50 the U.S. battleships opened fire. Radar fire control meant they could hit targets from a much greater distance than the Japanese. The battleship Yamashiro, a cruiser and a destroyer were crippled by 16-inch (406 mm) shells; Yamashiro sank at 04:19. Only one of Nishimura's force of seven ships survived the engagement. At 04:25 Shima's force of two cruisers and eight destroyers reached the battle. Seeing Fusō and believing her to be the wrecks of two battleships, Shima ordered a retreat, ending the last battleship-vs-battleship action in history.\\",\\n\\nanswer the following question.

Known for his southern drawl, his characters with a folksy-friendly personality, and his gruff, gregarious voice, Griffith was a Tony Award nominee for two roles, and gained prominence in the starring role in director Elia Kazan's film A Face in the Crowd (1957) before he became better known for his television roles, playing the lead roles of Andy Taylor in the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968) and Ben Matlock in the legal drama Matlock (1986-1995).\\n\\nGriffith's early career was as a monologist, delivering long stories such as What It Was, Was Football, which is told from the point of view of a naive country preacher trying to figure out what was going on in a football game. The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.  Griffith starred in Ira Levin's one-hour teleplay version of No Time for Sergeants (March 1955) -- a story about a country boy in the United States Air Force -- on The United States Steel Hour, a television anthology series. He expanded that role in Ira Levin's full-length theatrical version of the same name (October 1955) on Broadway in New York City. The role earned him a \\"Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor\\" nomination at the 1956 Tony Awards, losing to Ed Begley. He did win the 1956 Theatre World Award, however, a prize given for debut roles on Broadway. \\"Mr. Griffith does not have to condescend to Will Stockdale\\" (his role in the play), wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. \\"All he has to do is walk on the stage and look the audience straight in the face. If the armed forces cannot cope with Will Stockdale, neither can the audience resist Andy Griffith.\\"  Griffith later reprised his role for the film version (1958) of No Time for Sergeants; the film also featured Don Knotts, as a corporal in charge of manual-dexterity tests, marking the beginning of a lifelong association between Griffith and Knotts. No Time for Sergeants is considered the direct inspiration for the later television situation comedy Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.  His only other New York stage appearance was the titular role in the 1959 musical Destry Rides Again, co-starring Dolores Gray. The show, with a score by Harold Rome, ran for 472 performances and more than a year. Griffith was nominated for \\"Distinguished Musical Actor\\" at the 1960 Tony Awards, losing to Jackie Gleason.

They concentrated on a new arrangement of \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", a song recorded during the Highway 61 Revisited sessions but not included on that album. Three further numbers were attempted, but none progressed into completed songs. Both the fragmentary \\"Jet Pilot\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\", a quasi-parody of the Beatles' \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\", finally appeared on the 1985 box set retrospective, Biograph. Also attempted were two takes of \\"Medicine Sunday\\", a song that later evolved into \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\".On November 30, the Hawks joined Dylan again at Studio A, but drummer Bobby Gregg replaced Levon Helm, who had tired of playing in a backing band and quit. They began work on a new composition, \\"Freeze Out\\", which was later retitled \\"Visions of Johanna\\", but Dylan wasn't satisfied with the results. One of the November 30 recordings was eventually released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack in 2005. At this session, they completed \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\" The song was released as a single in December, but only reached number 58 on the American charts.Dylan spent most of December in California, performing a dozen concerts with his band, and then took a break through the third week in January following the birth of his son Jesse. On January 21, 1966, he returned to Columbia's Studio A to record another long composition, \\"She's Your Lover Now\\", accompanied by the Hawks (this time with Sandy Konikoff on drums). Despite nineteen takes, the session failed to yield any complete recordings. Dylan did not attempt the song again, but one of the outtakes from the January 21 session finally appeared 25 years later on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991.

His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books.

His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.

The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna.\\nResidents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops.

He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was known as Richard Coeur de Lion or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior.\\nContext: In September 1190 Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily. After the death of King William II of Sicily his cousin Tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in 1190 as King Tancred I of Sicily, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance, wife of the new Emperor Henry VI. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister, and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip Augustus. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip and Tancred. Its main terms were:  Joan was to receive 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold as compensation for her inheritance, which Tancred kept.  Richard officially proclaimed his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, son of Geoffrey, as his heir, and Tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to Arthur when he came of age, giving a further 20,000 ounces (570 kg) of gold that would be returned by Richard if Arthur did not marry Tancred's daughter.  The two kings stayed on in Sicily for a while, but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men, with Philip Augustus plotting with Tancred against Richard. The two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys (who had supposedly been the mistress of Richard's father Henry II).\\nQuestion: What else did he promise\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"The two kings finally met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard's betrothal to Philip's sister Alys","rationale":"The context describes a dispute between Richard and Philip Augustus.

Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination.   \\n OBJECTIVE To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock.    PROCESS A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment).    KEY FINDINGS FROM EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant.    RECOMMENDATIONS Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less.   \\n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that summarizes the objective of the study and its key findings (\\"IMPORTANCE Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001.

The night before their departure, the unit's officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.

As I walked with my family along the river I saw a statue. It was a young man who looked just like me. He was wearing a cap and smiling. Around his neck was a leather strap   and in his hands was a saxophone. He was lifting the saxophone to his lips and he was just about to play. I stayed there for a long time by the statue dreaming of playing a saxophone on TV.\\nTwo weeks later it was my birthday. Imagine my joy when I opened my present from my parents and found that it was a saxophone! I put it to my lips to play, but it wouldn't make a sound. Then Dad told me to read the instruction book to find out what to do. After about 15 minutes the saxophone was ready to play. I raised it slowly to my lips as my family watched. But still there was no sound. I blew and blew but I couldn't get the saxophone to play. I was almost crying when suddenly the saxophone made the most beautiful sound--loud and clear like I imagined the music of the man by the river in Kobe. I blew again, I moved my fingers on the saxophone and I made more sounds. I was happy because I was playing very interesting sounds. But I wasn't playing music yet.\\nThen came the lessons.

If the signal is polarized horizontally, the two signals subtract and the received signal is largely cancelled. The vertical plane radiation patterns are shown in the image at right. With vertical polarization there is always a maximum for θ=0, horizontal propagation (left pattern). For horizontal polarization, there is cancellation at that angle.

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success.\\nDue to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.

The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water.

She has one elder brother, Rick (born 1955), and two younger sisters, Dedee Pfeiffer (born 1964), a television and film actress, and Lori Pfeiffer (born 1965). Her parents were both originally from North Dakota. Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry.\\nContext: Pfeiffer chose to begin the process of dissolving her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.  In the Hitchcockian thriller What Lies Beneath (2000), Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford starred as a well-to-do couple who experience a strange haunting that uncovers secrets about their past. While critical response towards the film was mixed, it opened atop at the box office in July 2000, and went on to gross US$291 million worldwide. She then accepted the role of Rita Harrison, a highly strung lawyer helping a father with a developmental disability, in the drama I Am Sam (2001), opposite Sean Penn. Despite grossing $97.8 million worldwide, the movie received unfavorable reviews; Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: \\"Pfeiffer, apparently stymied by the bland cliches that prop up her screechy role, delivers her flattest, phoniest performance ever\\". Meanwhile, SF Gate observed: \\"In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life. It's hard not to cringe, watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material\\".  Pfeiffer took on the role of a murderous artist named Ingrid Magnussen in the drama White Oleander (2002), alongside Alison Lohman (in her film debut), Renee Zellweger and Robin Wright. The film was an arthouse success and Pfeiffer garnered a substantial amount of critical praise; Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that \\"Ms. Pfeiffer, giving the most complex screen performance of her career, makes her Olympian seductress at once irresistible and diabolical\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described her as \\"incandescent,\\" bringing \\"power and unshakable will to her role as mother-master manipulator\\" in a \\"riveting, impeccable performance\\". She earned Best Supporting Actress Awards from the San Diego Film Critics Society and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination.  Pfeiffer lent her voice for the character of goddess of chaos Eris in Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was \\"too sexual,\\" then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him \\"You know, you really can fire me\\", but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely out of the public eye to devote time to her husband and children. At the time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton.\\nQuestion: Did she ever come back after her hiatus?.

We align our body to the target only after we have aligned the club head to the target.  A proper stance starts with your feet being aligned at the target, followed by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target. As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability. Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club. Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line. The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing. Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.  \\"The elbows should be tucked in, not stuck out from the body. At address, the left elbow should point directly at the left hipbone and the right elbow should point directly at the right hipbone. Furthermore, there should be a sense of fixed jointness between the two forearms and the wrists, and it should be maintained throughout the swing.\\"  \\"You should bend your knees from the thighs down. As your knees bend, the upper part of the trunk remains normally erect, just as it does when you sit down in a chair.

The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to $10 from $5 and in circuit court to $20 from $10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is $50.50, and in circuit court $108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about $1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer.

The group was formed in 1992, and featured Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden. After several self-released records and cassettes, the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the V2 subsidiary Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios.\\n\\nIn March 2012, it was announced that Grandaddy had reformed and were to play a limited number of shows, including London on September 4, and headlining the End of the Road Festival in the UK. Grandaddy also played San Francisco's Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival and Paris's Rock en Seine Festival in August 2012. On August 7, 2012, to kick off their reunion tour, they played a \\"secret\\" show at the Partisan venue in Merced, California, but were billed as \\"The Arm of Roger\\". The next day they played as Grandaddy at the Henry Miller Library, Big Sur.  Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, \\"The bargain I made myself regarding the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna talk too much about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's the good thing about festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4x4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about.\\"  Lytle later noted, \\"It was actually Jim [Fairchild]'s fault. He suggested that we consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [but] he convinced me it might be a good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [and] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes. ... I was actually blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together.\\"  Lytle also noted that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, \\"It's probably going to happen. ... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [solo] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [it would be] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I like the idea of that. I'd like to give it a shot.\\" In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: \\"I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going to get out there and tour in support of it?' ...

He became famous when he became the first person to produce lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)  . In addition, he was also the first person to taste it and learn about its hallucinogenic   effects. He was deeply connected to the nature and argued that LSD, besides being useful for psychiatry , could also be used to promote awareness of mankind's place in nature. However, he was disappointed that his discovery was being carelessly used as a drug for entertainment. Because of his discovery, LSD fans have fondly called him \\"The father of LSD\\".

It lies in the Noordvleugel (\\"North Wing\\") of the larger polycentric Randstad metropolitan area and encompasses the city of Amsterdam, the Dutch provinces of North Holland and Flevoland, as well as 36 further municipalities within these two provinces, with a total population of over 2.4 million inhabitants.\\n\\n- Nicolaes Witsen (8 May 1641  10 August 1717; modern Dutch: \\"Nicolaas Witsen\\") was a Dutch statesman who was mayor of Amsterdam thirteen times, between 1682-1706. In 1693 he became administrator of the VOC. In 1689 he was extraordinary-ambassador to the English court, and became Fellow of the Royal Society. In his free time he was cartographer, maritime writer, and an authority on shipbuilding. His books on the subject are important sources on Dutch shipbuilding in the 17th century. Furthermore, he was an expert on Russian affairs. He was the first to describe Siberia, Far East and Central Asia in his study \\"Noord en Oost Tartarye\\" [North and East Tartary].\\n\\n- Amsterdam is the capital and most populous municipality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Founded in November 1660, it was granted a royal charter by King Charles II as \\"The Royal Society\\". The Society is the United Kingdom's and Commonwealth of Nations' Academy of Sciences and fulfills a number of roles; promoting science and its benefits, recognising excellence in science, supporting outstanding science, providing scientific advice for policy, fostering international and global cooperation, education and public engagement. \\nThe society is governed by its Council, which is chaired by the Society's President, according to a set of statutes and standing orders. The members of Council and the President are elected from and by its Fellows, the basic members of the society, who are themselves elected by existing Fellows. As of 2016, there are about 1,600 fellows, allowed to use the postnominal title FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society), with up to 52 new fellows appointed each year.

The present constitution is generally seen as directly derived from the one issued in 1815, constituting a constitutional monarchy. A revision in 1848 instituted a system of parliamentary democracy. In 1983, a major revision of the constitution was undertaken, almost fully rewriting the text and adding new civil rights. The text is very sober, devoid of legal or political doctrine. It includes a bill of rights. The constitution prohibits the judiciary to test laws and treaties against the constitution, as this is considered a prerogative of the legislature. There is no constitutional court in the Netherlands, except for the Constitutional Court of Sint Maarten which only governs the Sint Maarten legislator.

He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans.

Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.\\nTo create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.\\nFollowing the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice.

By the time the child reaches an age of about 18 to 25 years, all of the cartilage in the growth plate has been replaced by bone. This stops the bone from growing any longer.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

In healthy and disease states, cell migration is crucial in development and wound healing, as well as to maintain the body's homeostasis.    NEW METHOD The microfluidic chambers allow precise measurements to investigate whether fibroblasts carrying a mutation in the TOR1A gene, underlying the hereditary neurologic disease--DYT1 dystonia, have decreased migration properties when compared to control cells.   \\n RESULTS We observed that fibroblasts from DYT1 patients showed abnormalities in basic features of cell migration, such as reduced velocity and persistence of movement.    COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD The microfluidic method enabled us to demonstrate reduced polarization of the nucleus and abnormal orientation of nuclei and Golgi inside the moving DYT1 patient cells compared to control cells, as well as vectorial movement of single cells.   \\n CONCLUSION We report here different assays useful in determining various parameters of cell migration in DYT1 patient cells as a consequence of the TOR1A gene mutation, including a microfluidic platform, which provides a means to evaluate real-time vectorial movement with single cell resolution in a three-dimensional environment..

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.","target":"Yes","rationale":"Platonic solids are a class of polyhedra (3-dimensional shapes) that have the same number of faces meeting at each vertex.

De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so Durer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show Durer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of Adam and Eve (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces. This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name. Durer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the Betende Hande (English: Praying Hands, c. 1508 Albertina, Vienna), a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece.

The rock cycle is a basic concept in geology that describes the time-consuming transitions through geologic time among the three main rock types: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous. As the adjacent diagram illustrates, each of the types of rocks is altered or destroyed when it is forced out of its equilibrium conditions. An igneous rock such as basalt may break down and dissolve when exposed to the atmosphere, or melt as it is subducted under a continent. Due to the driving forces of the rock cycle, plate tectonics and the water cycle, rocks do not remain in equilibrium and are forced to change as they encounter new environments. The rock cycle is an illustration that explains how the three rock types are related to each other, and how processes change from one type to another over time. This cyclical aspect makes rock change a geologic cycle and, on planets containing life, a biogeochemical cycle During the rock cycle process, sedimentary rocks can become metamorphic or igneous rocks as they are buried in the planet's crust with younger layers of rock above them. Eventually they can metamorphose under heat and pressure at great depth, or melt to form new magma. Uplifting of rock layers by earth forces can bring rocks near the surface again at any point in the cycle. Igneous and metamorphic rocks can weather to form sediments that later become sedimentary rocks. Igneous rocks can metamorphose when subjected again to heat and pressure. Metamorphic rocks can metamorphose in repeat episodes or melt into magma, which later cools to form igneous rocks. Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill. It has a composition similar to gabbro. The difference between basalt and gabbro is that basalt is a fine-grained rock while gabbro is a coarse-grained rock. Basalt (pronounced /bəˈsɔːlt/, /ˈbæsɒlt/ or /ˈbæsɔːlt/) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. A: Basalt is primarily formed by the extrusion of lava flows onto the surface of the earth during a volcanic eruption. The intrusion of a narrow sill or igneous dike below the crust also results in the formation of basalt. Basalt is a type of igneous rock that is typically dark in coloration with a fine-grained texture. It is the most predominant rock type found in Earth's crust, and mainly consists of pyroxene and plagioclase minerals. Volcanoes that form basalt are commonly found near the ocean basins. IGNEOUS ROCKS (obsidian, granite, scoria, basalt) - all samples seem to be hard and not breakable. GRANITE: Granite is an igneous rock that cooled very slowly. We know this because the minerals in granite are very large. It takes a long time (hundreds of thousands of years) for rocks to grow to visible size. BASALT: Basalt cooled more quickly than granite. A type of igneous rock. Basalt is the most common rock type in the earth's crust and makes up most of the ocean floor. A process that turns sediment into sedimentary rock. Over time, sediment accumulates in oceans, lakes, and valleys, eventually building up in layers and weighing down the material underneath. Molten rock that flows beneath the earth's surface and is made up of gases, liquids, and crystals. When magma reaches the surface, it is called lava. Marble A type of metamorphic rock formed when limestone is pushed down into the earth and subjected to intense heat and pressure for a long period of time. Melting dating: The global tectonic rock cycle …that allow black lava, called basalt, to reach the surface. The portion that remains in a fissure below the surface usually forms a vertical black tubular body known as a dike (or dyke). Basalt Rocks Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock that is very dark in color. It is the most common type of rock in the Earth's crust and it makes up most of the ocean floor. It is made of many dark colored minerals such as pyroxene and olivine. Basalt also contains some light colored minerals such as feldspar and quartz, but the amounts are small.

It is known for musical improvisation, extended jams, blending of genres, and a dedicated fan base. The current line-up--guitarist and lead vocalist Trey Anastasio, bassist and vocalist Mike Gordon, drummer and vocalist Jon Fishman, and keyboardist and vocalist Page McConnell--performed together for 15 years before going on hiatus from October 7, 2000, to December 30, 2002. They resumed touring from December 31, 2002, until August 15, 2004, when they announced that the Coventry Festival would be their last show.\\nContext: Over two years after the hiatus began, Phish announced that they were getting back on the road with a New Year's Eve 2002 concert at Madison Square Garden. They also recorded Round Room in only three days. In their return concert, McConnell's brother was introduced as actor Tom Hanks. The impostor sang a line of the song \\"Wilson\\", prompting several media outlets to report that the actor had \\"jammed with Phish\\".  At the end of the 2003 summer tour, Phish held their first summer festival in four years, returning to Limestone, Maine, for It. The festival drew crowds of over 60,000 fans, once again making Limestone one of the largest cities in Maine for a weekend. In November - December, the band celebrated its 20th anniversary with a four-show mini-tour of shows in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.  In order to avoid the exhaustion and pitfalls of previous years' high-paced touring, Phish played sporadically after the reunion, with tours lasting about two weeks. After an April 2004 run of shows in Las Vegas, Anastasio announced on the band's website that the band was breaking up after a small summer tour.  Their final album (at the time), Undermind, was released in late spring. In the summer of 2004, the band jammed with rapper Jay-Z at one show, shot a video called \\"Live in Brooklyn\\" for broadcast in movie theaters, and performed a seven-song set atop the marquee of the Ed Sullivan Theater during the Late Show with David Letterman to fans who had gathered on the street, a move reminiscent of The Beatles' final performance on the rooftop of the Apple building in London.  Their final show of 2004--Coventry--was named for the town in Vermont that hosted the event. 100,000 people were expected to attend. After a week of rain that prompted fears of a sinking stage, Gordon announced on local radio that no more cars would be allowed in, though only about 20,000 people had arrived. Many concert-goers parked their vehicles on roadsides and hiked to the site; an estimated 65,000 attended the emotional finale.\\nQuestion: Was Undermind another one of their albums?.

The main sources of this problem are coal-burning factories which release large amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the environment during their fuel combustion process; NOx then contributes directly or indirectly to acidification by combining with water vapor in the air forming either Nitric Acid (HNO3) or Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4)."},{"source":"Over time a species of bird has changed a lot.

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges.

Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations. The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favor of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.","target":"Napoleon","rationale":"The context is a brief background of the Peninsular War and how Napoleon Bonaparte's departure from this war to deal with Europe lead to his defeat in Iberia.\\nHence, it can be concluded that the main subject about which this passage describes is Napoleon Bonaparte"},{"source":"Two twin sisters, Bianca and Rosa, were exposed to high levels of air pollution.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air.

Passage:With the ascendance of Simeon I to the throne in 893, the long-lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end. A conflict arose when Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise, acting under pressure from his wife Zoe Zaoutzaina and her father, Stylianos Zaoutzes, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. Forced to take action, in the autumn of 894 Simeon invaded the Byzantine Empire from the north, meeting little opposition due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern Anatolia to counter Arab invasions. Informed of the Bulgarian offensive, the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon, but his troops were routed somewhere in the theme of Macedonia.The Magyars managed to defeat Simeon's army twice, but in 896 they were routed in the Battle of Southern Buh.

Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [S2P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 7040% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [S2P]eDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virusspecific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains. The results suggest that as previously shown with A59 (S. Cheley, R. Anderson, M. J. Cupples, E. C. M. Lee Chan, and V. L. Morris (1981) Virdogy, 112,596-604), all MHV strains tested encode a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. Analysis of [?l]methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that each strain of MHV specified four major viral polypeptides with apparent molecular weights very similar to those previously reported for the E2, N, El, and PEl polypeptides of A59. The strong degree of interstrain homology among the five MHV strains investigated was confirmed by comparative chymotryptic peptide mapping of the viral N proteins. A majority of the chymotryptic peptides from each of the [35S$nethioninelabeled N proteins was found to coelute by high-performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, this technique of peptide mapping indicated a particularly strong relatedness between MHV-1 and MHV-S and among MHV3, JHM, and A59.","target":"RNA and Polypeptide Homology among Murine Coronaviruses","rationale":"The title should provide evidence for the interstrain homology among the five MHV strains investigated, and describe the relationships between RNA and polypeptides in these strains.

Custer on June 25, 1876, in the Battle of Little Bighorn, the United States government sent a large number of reinforcements into Montana Territory. By autumn, a few bands of the Sioux and Cheyenne tribes had begun returning to the reservations and agencies to acquire food and annuity goods in preparation for winter. The United States Congress had angered many Indians by demanding that they cede the Black Hills to the government in exchange for these promised goods. The army had replaced civilian contractors in charge of the agencies, further convincing many war bands to stay away from them. General Nelson Miles led a mixed force of infantry, artillery and cavalry after Sitting Bull's band, and had effectively defeated them by December. Ranald S. Mackenzie had similarly defeated Dull Knife's Cheyennes, who trekked through snow and icy conditions to join the camp of Crazy Horse in the Tongue River Valley. Concerned with the approaching winter and the destitute condition of Dull Knife's band, Crazy Horse decided to negotiate peace with the army. However, when a group of United States Army Crow scouts murdered Crazy Horse's delegation, the war chief demanded revenge. He led a series of small raids in an effort to draw out Colonel Miles from Tongue River Cantonment. In December, 1876, Colonel Miles led most of nine Infantry companies out of the Cantonment in pursuit of Crazy Horse, marching south, up the Tongue River valley.

On May 7, 1958, channel 13's call sign was changed to WNTA-TV to reflect the new ownership; the radio stations also adopted these call letters. NTA's cash resources enabled WNTA-TV to produce a schedule of programming with greater emphasis on the people and events of New Jersey, compared to the other commercial television stations. NTA also sought to make channel 13 the center of a new commercial network, though during its run the NTA Film Network offered only one night of \\"in-pattern\\" network programming, Friday nights in 1957–58, and for most purposes WNTA served as the New York showcase for nationally syndicated programming and produced several such entries, notably the anthology drama series Play of the Week; the talk show Open End, hosted by David Susskind; children's show The Magic Clown; and a popular dance program emceed by Clay Cole. The station continued to lag behind New York's other independent stations—WNEW-TV (channel 5), WOR-TV (channel 9) and WPIX (channel 11)—in terms of audience size, and NTA incurred a large debt load. National Telefilm Associates put the WNTA stations up for sale in February 1961.\\n Passage 3:Forman and Bishop William Elphinstone of Aberdeen were the principal envoys who brokered a seven-year truce with King Henry VII of England at Aytoun in September 1497. They were assisted by the Spanish ambassador Pedro de Ayala, who recommended in May 1498 that diplomatic correspondence to Scotland should be copied to Forman, his influential friend. The search for a queen for James began in 1499 when negotiators were appointed to treat with King Henry for the marriage of his eldest daughter, Princess Margaret. Dispensation from the pope for the marriage was received as both James and Margaret were cousins, descended from John Beaufort, Marquess of Dorset. On 8 October 1501, Forman, now postulate to the see of Moray, was commissioned along with Robert Blackadder, Archbishop of Glasgow and Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell to conclude the treaty of marriage. In that same year, King Henry, in gratitude for his services required that Thomas Savage, Archbishop of York institute Forman as Rector of the parish church of Cottingham. On 26 November 1501, Pope Alexander VI provided Forman to the bishopric of Moray and then only a few months later in 1502, Bishop Forman concluded the Treaty of Perpetual Peace with England at Richmond Palace. The formal proceedings that finally concluded the marriage terms of King James and Margaret Tudor were conducted in Glasgow Cathedral on 10 December 1502 where Forman was a signatory. He was then appointed as a commissioner to oversee the exchange of the ratified marriage treaties at the courts of Henry and James. James designated Forman to conduct Margaret to Scotland but while in England, gave King Henry an undertaking that the King of Scots would not renew the league with France unless Henry was first consulted. The procession to Scotland took them to Fast Castle near Berwick where they stayed with Forman's sister Isabel and her husband Alexander Oliphant of Kellie. In 1509, Forman became commendator of Dryburgh Abbey and tried unsuccessfully to obtain the commendatorship of the wealthy abbey of Kelso in 1511. The lands and possessions of the parson of Boleskin, south of Inverness were given to Forman (as bishop of Moray) in 1511 and then in 1512 he became the Keeper of the castle of Darnaway, near Forres, Chamberlain of Moray and Custumar north of the River Spey.","target":"3","rationale":"The correct answer is \\"3\\", as it contains the text: \\"Congress had angered many Indians by demanding that they cede the Black Hills to the government in exchange for these promised goods.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a \\"boule\\" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition).

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a $10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder $6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money.

Though prevailing, they are observed to generalize poorly compared with SGD or even fail to converge due to unstable and extreme learning rates. Recent work has put forward some algorithms such as AMSGrad to tackle this issue but they failed to achieve considerable improvement over existing methods. In our paper, we demonstrate that extreme learning rates can lead to poor performance. We provide new variants of Adam and AMSGrad, called AdaBound and AMSBound respectively, which employ dynamic bounds on learning rates to achieve a gradual and smooth transition from adaptive methods to SGD and give a theoretical proof of convergence. We further conduct experiments on various popular tasks and models, which is often insufficient in previous work. Experimental results show that new variants can eliminate the generalization gap between adaptive methods and SGD and maintain higher learning speed early in training at the same time. Moreover, they can bring significant improvement over their prototypes, especially on complex deep networks. The implementation of the algorithm can be found at https://github.com/Luolc/AdaBound .","target":"Novel variants of optimization methods that combine the benefits of both adaptive and non-adaptive methods","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nNovel variants of optimization methods that combine the benefits of both adaptive and non-adaptive methods"},{"source":"bobby pin","target":"can fall in stockings","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"can fall in stockings\\"."},{"source":"Choose your answer: If \\"An elderly woman is reading a paper in an office.\\", does it logically follow that \\"An old guy is jumping rope.\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The first sentence describes a woman reading a paper.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis.

The sensory changes include burning pain, numbness, tingling, and loss of sensation, while the motor changes range from weakness to complete paralysis. The episodes are transient and complete recovery usually occurs in ten to fifteen minutes, although in some patients gradual resolution occurs over a period of thirty-six to forty-eight hours. Except for burning paresthesia, pain in the neck is not present at the time of injury and there is complete return of motor function and full, pain-free motion of the cervical spine. In our series, routine roentgenograms of the cervical spine were negative for fractures or dislocations in all patients. However, the roentgenographic findings did include developmental spinal stenosis in seventeen patients, congenital fusion in five patients, cervical instability in four patients, and intervertebral disc disease in six patients. Spinal stenosis was determined by two different roentgenographic methods. The first was the standard method, and the second was a ratio method devised by us. Both measurements were made at the level of the third through the sixth vertebral body on a routine lateral roentgenogram of the cervical spine that was available for twenty-four of the thirty-two patients and for a control group of forty-nine male subjects of similar age who did not have any neurological complaints. Using the ratio method, a measurement of less than 0.80 indicated significant spinal stenosis in the group of twenty-four patients for whom roentgenograms were available, as compared with a ratio of approximately 1.00 or more in the control group. There was statistically significant spinal stenosis (p less than 0.0001) in all of the patients as compared with the control subjects by both methods of determining spinal stenosis. A survey of 503 schools participating in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football in the 1984 season found that 1.3 per 10,000 athletes had a history that was suggestive of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord. The phenomenon of neurapraxia of the cervical spinal cord occurs in individuals with developmental stenosis of the cervical spine, congenital fusion, cervical instability, or protrusion of an intervertebral disc in association with a decrease in the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal.

Dysregulation of miR-744 is common in a number of cancers, indicating miR-774 might be closely correlated with the tumorigenesis process. However, the role and clinical significance of miR-774 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is poorly known. Thus the aim of this study is to investigate whether there was any clinical value of serum miR-744 in detecting and predicting the prognosis of NPC.', 'Real-time PCR was used to examine the expression level of serum miR-744 in patients with NPC and the healthy volunteers. The changes in serum miR-744 expression level of NPC patients after receiving chemo-radiotherapy were also evaluated. The association between pre-treatment serum miR-744 expression level and NPC clinicopathological parameters was investigated. Finally we employed Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the clinical value of serum miR-744 in predicting the prognosis of NPC.', 'Our study showed the expression level of serum miR-744 was significant higher in patients with NPC in comparison with healthy controls (P<0.01).

The group broke up in early 1975, and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri. \\nIn its first era, the band's musical style drew on the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Byrds. Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \\"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations,\\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \\"quintessential American power pop band,\\" and \\"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\\".Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records, and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. \\nAfter a third album, recorded in the fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success, but has since become a cult classic. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27.\\nDuring the group's hiatus in the 1980s, the Big Star discography drew renewed attention when R.E.M. and the Replacements, as well as other popular bands, cited the group as an influence.

Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\\n\\nIs AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : About 4 months ago I (27 m) met someone (27 f) on a dating site. Apparently we went to the same school, so we knew of each other but never really met before. We hit it off pretty quickly, had a lot in common, and went on a couple of dates. During the 2nd date she had told me that her ex fiance cheated and left her only a few weeks before and that her friends basically made her profile for her. We were genuinely enjoying each other's company and conversations though so I said that it's okay if she isn't ready. I went through a similar situation last year so I knew what she was going through. \\n\\nOver the next couple months we hung out a lot, talked every day, and told each other things that our closest friends and family didnt know. We hung out so much that all her friends and family thought that we were dating. We comforted each other and even \\"cuddled\\" a few times for comfort. We have had conversations about sex, but never tried anything.\\n\\nI have told her how I felt about her, not in an annoying way. She said that she doesn't want to hurt me as she was still confused. We went on a trip with my friends, and on the drive there I said something jokingly, along the lines of \\"I know we aren't together, but try not to get too friendly with my friend (friend's name), he can be a pretty smooth player\\". She said that she didnt have any interest in him, and after a little bit said \\"I dont know, are we together?\\" That really sent a lot of emotions through me and I wasn't sure what to say. A while ago, I expressed that I just want her to be happy, whether we are together or just friends and I want to be a good friend to her no matter what. I asked what she meant about what she said before and she said that she just doesn't know and doesn't want to hurt me. \\n\\nSince then we only saw each other once and talk once or twice a week. It has felt very weird since we would talk all day before. I have initiated conversations but get little to no replies any more. I know she's busy and has been going through a lot though so I understand.\\n\\nHowever, this past weekend I was out at the bar with a couple friends and decided to text her asking how she was doing. After a short convo she told me that she met someone, a friend's brother. It got to me quite a bit, not just because of how I felt about her, but how it all kinda made sense to me. I dont need to hear it from her, but I have a strong feeling that she just didnt want to tell me that she wasn't into me and the reason she doesn't talk to me much is because she doesn't want to see me hurt and it's easiest for her. If that were the case I wish she'd told me a long time ago so I didn't have all of these mixed signals and feelings over the last few months.

This is a good representation of Earth as a magnet. Like a bar magnet, Earth has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field. Although a compass always points north, it doesnt point to Earths geographic north pole, which is located at 90 north latitude (see Figure 24.11). Instead, it points to Earths magnetic north pole, which is located at about 80 north latitude. Earths magnetic south pole is also located several degrees of latitude away from the geographic south pole. A compass pointer has north and south poles, and its north pole points to Earths magnetic north pole. Why does this happen if opposite poles attract? Why doesnt the compass needle point south instead? The answer may surprise you. Earths magnetic north pole is actually the south pole of magnet Earth! Its called the magnetic north pole to avoid confusion. Because its close to the geographic north pole, it would be confusing to call it the magnetic south pole. Like all magnets, Earth has a magnetic field. Earths magnetic field is called the magnetosphere. It is a huge region that extends outward from Earth for several thousand kilometers but is strongest at the poles. You can see the extent of the magnetosphere in Figure 24.12. For an animated version of the magnetosphere, watch the video at this URL: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Do you like to read science fiction? Science fiction writers are really creative. For example, an author might write about a time in the distant past when compasses pointed south instead of north. Actually, this idea isnt fictionits a fact! Earths magnetic poles have switched places repeatedly over the past hundreds of millions of years, each time reversing Earths magnetic field. This is illustrated in Figure 24.13. Scientists dont know for certain why magnetic reversals occur, but there is hard evidence showing that they have occurred. The evidence comes from rocks on the ocean floor. Look at Figure 24.14, which shows a ridge on the ocean floor. At the center of the ridge, hot magma pushes up through the crust and hardens into rock. Once the magma hardens, the alignment of magnetic domains in the rock is frozen in place forever. The newly hardened rock is then gradually pushed away from the ridge in both directions as more magma erupts and newer rock forms. Rock samples from many places on the ocean floor reveal that magnetic domains of rocks from different time periods are aligned in opposite directions. The evidence shows that Earths magnetic field reversed hundreds of times over the last 330 million years. The last reversal was less than a million years ago. What might happen if a magnetic reversal occurred in your lifetime? How might it affect you? You can learn more about Earths magnetic reversals at this URL: . The idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. However, explaining why Earth acts like a magnet is a relatively recent discovery. It had to wait until the development of technologies such as seismographs, which detect and measure earthquake waves. Then scientists could learn about Earths inner structure (see Figure 24.15). They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core and that the outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated by the movement of charged particles through the molten metals in the outer core. The particles move as Earth spins on its axis. The video at the URL below takes a closer look at how this occurs. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles, where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole and tell direction.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

Passage 1:When the American Civil War began, Weitzel was assigned to construct defenses, including in Cincinnati and Washington, as well as for George McClellan in the Army of the Potomac in late 1861. He was then attached to the staff of Major General Benjamin F. Butler as chief engineer of the Department of the Gulf. When Union troops captured New Orleans, Weitzel became assistant military commander and acting mayor. He was promoted to brigadier general in August 1862 and two months later routed a large force of the enemy at Labadieville, Louisiana, which earned him a brevet promotion to major in the Regular Army. Weitzel commanded a brigade in the XIX Corps advancing in Major General Nathaniel P. Banks's operations in western Louisiana during April and May 1863, which led to the siege of Port Hudson. Weitzel was later brevetted lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army, \\"for gallant and meritorious services at the siege of Port Hudson,\\" which fell on July 9, 1863, days after Vicksburg, Mississippi, about 120 miles upriver, the last Confederate stronghold on the great Mississippi, had fallen. Together those successful sieges and the continuing blockage of Southern ports completed the Anaconda Plan.\\n Passage 2:Robertson moved to Central States Wrestling, where he won the majority of his titles. On October 22, 1981, he won the NWA Central States Television Championship with a victory over Gene Lewis. He lost the belt to Oliver Humperdink later that year but soon regained it in a rematch. On February 18, 1982, however, he dropped the belt back to Lewis. This allowed Robertson to focus on the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, which he won a total of five times. His first reign came in October 1981 when he teamed with Rufus R. Jones to defeat Buzz Tyler and James J. Dillon. His next reign came in March 1982 when he teamed with Steve Regal to win the belts from Roger Kirby and Jerry Valiant. The title changed hands twice more that month, as Kirby and Valiant quickly regained the title only to drop it back to Robertson and Regal. Two months later, Kirby and Valiant won the belts back again. Robertson found a new partner, however, and won the championship by teaming with Hercules Hernandez in August. The reign lasted less than a month, but Robertson and Hernandez held the belts one final time after another victory in September 1982. The following year, Robertson's main success came as a singles wrestler. On February 10, 1983, he won the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship with a victory over Manny Fernandez. He lost the belt to Bob Brown two months later but regained it in a rematch the following week. Robertson's final title reign ended when he dropped the title to Race on June 2, 1983.\\n Passage 3:Keith Cerny is an American opera director and businessman.

Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.\\n\\n- Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States. It borders the other U.S. states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of New York and the Green Mountains run north-south the length of the state.\\n\\n- A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.\\n\\n- A population is the number of all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area, and have the capability of interbreeding.\\n\\n- Grand Isle County is a county located in the U.S. state of Vermont. As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,970, making it the second-least populous county in Vermont. Its shire town (county seat) is the municipality of North Hero.

It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.\\n\\n- Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.\\n\\n- A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).\\n\\n- South Hero is a town on Grand Isle in Grand Isle County , Vermont , United States .

It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.\\n\\n- The New England town (generally referred to simply as a town in New England) is the basic unit of local government and local division of state authority in each of the six New England states. Without a direct counterpart in most other U.S. states, New England towns overlay the entire area of a state, similar to civil townships in other states where they exist, but are fully functioning municipal corporations, possessing powers similar to cities in other states; New Jersey's system of equally powerful townships, boroughs, towns and cities is the most similar system to New England's. New England towns are often governed by a town meeting legislative body. The great majority of municipal corporations in New England are based on the town model; statutory forms based on the concept of a compact populated place, which is prevalent elsewhere in the U.S., are uncommon. County government in New England states is typically weak at best, sometimes even nonexistent. Connecticut, for example, has no county governments,\\nnor does Rhode Island. Both of those states retain counties only as geographic subdivisions with no governmental authority, while Massachusetts has abolished eight of fourteen county governments so far. With few exceptions, counties serve mostly as dividing lines for the states' judicial systems.\\n\\n- The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.\\n\\n- The Richelieu River takes its source in Lake Champlain, from which it flows to the north in the province of Quebec, Canada and empties into the St. Lawrence river. It was formerly known as the Iroquois River and the Chambly River.

Passage:Down the coast of Africa: The Portuguese reached the westernmost point of Africa in 1444 and in 1458 rounded Cape Palmas where the coast tends eastward. Here the trade winds gave out and they faced the irregular winds near the doldrums and the east-flowing Guinea Current. In 1471 they reached the Gold coast where they found the gold that had previously come by caravan across the Sahara. In 1474 Lopes Gonçalves reached the point where the coast turns south and became the first European sailor to cross the equator. In 1475-79 Spain and Portugal fought along the coast. The Treaty of Alcáçovas gave the whole area to the Portuguese except for the Canaries. This was the first colonial war and the first colonial treaty. In 1482 Diogo Cão continued south against the Benguela current and the southeast trade winds, reaching the Congo River in 1482 and Cape Cross in Namibia in 1485. In 1487 Bartolomeu Dias reached Cape Voltas near the mouth of the Orange River and stood out to sea. Although the sources are not clear, he may have guessed that there were southern westerlies and was trying a volta do mar. After many days, at about 40 degrees south he discovered the westerlies and turned east. Finding no land after a number of days he turned north and reached Mossel Bay about 400 km east of Cape Town. He continued east against the Agulhas current to Algoa Bay where the coast began to turn north. Guessing that he had found the route to India, he turned back, discovered and rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached Lisbon in 1488.

Morrison in 1850; it served as a capitol until the government moved to Salem. Governor Joseph Lane affirmed Oregon City's status as capital by proclamation. In 1850, the legislature passed an act designating Salem the capital. However, Governor John P.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\\n\\nQuery: SELECT DISTINCT ?x0 WHERE {\\n?x0 ns:film.film.directed_by ?x1 .\\n?x0 ns:film.film.executive_produced_by ?x1 .\\n?x0 ns:film.film.produced_by|ns:film.film.production_companies ?x1 .\\n?x0 ns:film.film.written_by ?x1 .\\n?x1 ns:film.cinematographer.film M0 .\\n?x1 ns:film.producer.film|ns:film.production_company.films M0 .\\n?x1 ns:film.writer.film M0\\n} Question: What film that was edited by and executive produced by a producer of M2 was executive produced and written by M1","target":"0","rationale":"The question asks for a film that was edited by and executive produced by a producer of M2.

Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, at the time of its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.\\nAlthough Watts received many offers to buy the painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it would be inappropriate not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.\\nAs cheap reproductions of Hope, and from 1908 high-quality prints, began to circulate in large quantities, it became a widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.\\nDespite the decline in Watts's popularity, Hope remained influential.

Their followup album Incredible (2002), reached number one on the Top Gospel Albums chart. Their third album, Mary Mary (2005), which contains themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits \\"Heaven\\", \\"The Real Party\\", and \\"Yesterday\\".\\nContext: From 2007 to 2012, the Campbells both served as judges alongside Donnie McClurkin for a gospel music competition show on BET called Sunday Best.  On October 21, 2008 they released their fifth studio album, The Sound. The lead single, \\"Get Up,\\" was released digitally via ITunes on July 15, 2008. Mary Mary's The Sound achieved great success in the mainstream market and sold over 37,000 copies in its first week, making it their best charting album to date. It debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, number two on the US R&B Chart, and topped both gospel and country music charts. The album held the number one position on the Billboard's Gospel Album Chart for over six months since its release. Warryn Campbell produced the album and collaborated with many professionals: Kierra Sheard, David Banner, Marvin Winans, Daryl Coley, Andrae Crouch, The Rance Allen Group, Dorinda Clark Cole, Joe Ligon, Walter Hawkins, Tramaine Hawkins, and Karen Clark Sheard.

He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.\\nThe young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\".

This study is based on a retrospective analysis of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and July 2015. A Geoadditive variable model for binary outcomes was applied to account for both individual level risk factors as well spatial variation via a fully Bayesian approach. Out of 959 confirmed cases, 642 (67%) were males and 317 (33%) had died. Three hundred and sixty four (38%) cases occurred in Ar Riyad province, while 325 (34%) cases occurred in Makkah. Individuals with some comorbidity had a significantly higher likelihood of dying from MERS-CoV compared with those who did not suffer comorbidity [Odds ratio (OR) = 2.071; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.307, 3.263].

Both teams went into the game with 0-2 records, hoping to move away from the bottom of the division standings. Deep into the 1st quarter, Vikings QB Brett Favre continued his interception-throwing form, as he was picked off by Lions DT Corey Williams while attempting to throw a short pass to RB Toby Gerhart. Williams set off on a run, but Gerhart recovered to bring him down at the Minnesota 12-yard line. Three short plays later, Detroit had the ball in the end zone, QB Shaun Hill finishing off the drive with a 5-yard pass to TE Tony Scheffler. The Vikings were forced to punt the ball away on their first drive after the touchdown, but Detroit PR Stefan Logan fumbled while attempting to catch the ball, which was recovered by Vikings LB Chad Greenway 24 yards from the Detroit goal line. With the first play of the drive, Favre threw a 24-yard pass to WR Percy Harvin, who made a diving catch for the game-tying touchdown. Detroit's next drive resulted in a missed field goal, allowing the Vikings to go 66 yards back down the field for a touchdown, finished off by a 6-yard run from Adrian Peterson. With a minute left in the first half, Favre was picked off yet again, as his throwing arm was hit by Lions DE Cliff Avril, giving Alphonso Smith a simple interception. The Lions drove 36 yards into the Minnesota half, and Jason Hanson ended the 2nd quarter with a field goal from 33 yards. Minnesota began the second half with the ball and took 10 plays to get into the Detroit red zone; however, the Detroit defense stood firm and the Vikings were limited to a 31-yard field goal from Ryan Longwell. The Lions managed to get back into the Minnesota half on their next possession, but they went 3-and-out on the Minnesota 41-yard line before punting into the end zone for a touchback. On the very next play, Vikings HB Adrian Peterson broke a career-long 80-yard run for a touchdown to put Minnesota 24-10 up. On Detroit's next possession, a sack on 3rd-and-20 by Vikings DE Brian Robison on QB Shaun Hill sparked a mass brawl between the two teams. As the defense made their way off the field, Brett Favre was seen giving them vigorous verbal encouragement. Midway through the 4th quarter, Minnesota RB Toby Gerhart fumbled the ball in a tackle, and it was recovered by Detroit FS Louis Delmas. The Lions then drove back down the field from their own 22-yard line to within 4 yards of the Minnesota end zone in just under 5 minutes. However, on 1st-and-goal, Vikings LB Ben Leber intercepted Shaun Hill's attempted pass to RB Maurice Morris inside the end zone before returning it to the Minnesota 18-yard line. The Vikings failed in their attempt to run the clock down to the two-minute warning and had to punt the ball away, giving the Lions one final chance to reduce their deficit. Beginning the drive at their own 38-yard line, they got to the Minnesota 10-yard line within seven plays, but CB Antoine Winfield intercepted Hill's attempt at another touchdown pass to Tony Scheffler inside the endzone for a touchback with only a minute to go.

At that time BYU Professor Ellis Rasmussen and his associates were asked by the LDS Church to begin preparation for a new edition of the Holy Scriptures. One aspect of that effort entailed digitizing the text and preparing appropriate footnotes, another aspect required establishing the most dependable text. To that latter end, Stanley R. Larson (a Rasmussen graduate student) set about applying modern text critical standards to the manuscripts and early editions of the Book of Mormon as his thesis project – which he completed in 1974. To that end, Larson carefully examined the Original Manuscript (the one dictated by Joseph Smith to his scribes) and the Printer’s Manuscript (the copy Oliver Cowdery prepared for the Printer in 1829–1830), and compared them with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of the Book of Mormon to determine what sort of changes had occurred over time and to make judgments as to which readings were the most original. Larson proceeded to publish a useful set of well-argued articles on the phenomena which he had discovered. Many of his observations were included as improvements in the 1981 LDS edition of the Book of Mormon.\\nWhat is the answer to this question: When did Larson finish his project?","target":"1974","rationale":"The article states that Larson's project was completed in 1974."},{"source":"Both sides had forces that did not arrive at Sekigahara in time to participate due to other battles.

Jesse is going to Vienna to catch a flight back to the United States, whereas Celine is returning to university in Paris after visiting her grandmother. When they reach Vienna, Jesse convinces Celine to disembark with him, saying that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her marriage and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked another guy, and this is a chance to realize that he himself is not that different from the rest; in his words, he is \\"the same boring, unmotivated guy.\\" Jesse has to catch a flight early in the morning and does not have enough money to rent a room for the night, so they decide to roam around in Vienna. After visiting a few landmarks in Vienna, they share a kiss at the top of the Wiener Riesenrad at sunset and start to feel a romantic connection. As they continue to roam around the city, they begin to talk more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, religion, and their observations of the city. Celine tells Jesse that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she \\"loved him too much\\". When questioned, Jesse reveals he had initially come to Europe to spend time with his girlfriend who was studying in Madrid, but they had broken up when she was avoiding him while he was there. He decided to take a cheap flight home, via Vienna, but it did not leave for two weeks so he bought a Eurail pass and traveled around Europe. When they are walking alongside the Donaukanal (Danube canal) they are approached by a man who, instead of begging, offers to write them a poem with a word of their choice in it. Jesse and Celine decide on the word \\"milkshake\\", and are soon presented with the poem Delusion Angel (written for the film by the poet David Jewell). In a traditional Viennese cafe, Jesse and Celine stage fake phone conversations with each other, playing each other's friends they pretend to call. Celine reveals that she was ready to get off the train with Jesse before he convinced her. Jesse reveals that after he broke up with his girlfriend, he bought a flight that really was not much cheaper, and all he really wanted was an escape from his life. They admit their attraction to each other and how the night has made them feel, though they understand that they probably will not see each other again when they leave. They simply decide to make the best of what time they have left, ending the night with the implication of a sexual encounter between them. At that point, Jesse explains that if given the choice, he would marry her instead of never seeing her again. The film ends the next day at the train station, where, just as Celine's train is about to leave, the couple decides not to exchange any contact information but instead to meet at the same place in six months. \\n Question: Jesse and Cline decide to meet again at the train station after how many months?","target":"six months","rationale":"The shortest span that answers the question is: \\"six months\\"."},{"source":"Given a comment, classify it into a 'hate' speech or 'not hate' speech.
