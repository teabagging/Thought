He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times.\\n\\nMickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments.  Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event.  That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.

Results: Genotypes B, E, F and G were identified. Two clusters of patients were defined from chronological data and phylogenetic trees.

However, the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class 'white flight' left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before.

However, the differences between the learned solutions of networks which generalize and those which do not remain unclear. Additionally, the tuning properties of single directions (defined as the activation of a single unit or some linear combination of units in response to some input) have been highlighted, but their importance has not been evaluated. Here, we connect these lines of inquiry to demonstrate that a network’s reliance on single directions is a good predictor of its generalization performance, across networks trained on datasets with different fractions of corrupted labels, across ensembles of networks trained on datasets with unmodified labels, across different hyper- parameters, and over the course of training. While dropout only regularizes this quantity up to a point, batch normalization implicitly discourages single direction reliance, in part by decreasing the class selectivity of individual units. Finally, we find that class selectivity is a poor predictor of task importance, suggesting not only that networks which generalize well minimize their dependence on individual units by reducing their selectivity, but also that individually selective units may not be necessary for strong network performance.","target":"We find that deep networks which generalize poorly are more reliant on single directions than those that generalize well, and evaluate the impact of dropout and batch normalization, as well as class selectivity on single direction reliance","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe find that deep networks which generalize poorly are more reliant on single directions than those that generalize well, and evaluate the impact of dropout and batch normalization, as well as class selectivity on single direction reliance."},{"source":"The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population.

If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans.\\nWith the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood.

Ricketts (January 15, 1853  January 19, 1939), often credited as Tom Ricketts, was an English stage and film actor and director who was a pioneer in the film industry. He portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in the first American film adaptation of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (1908), and directed one of the first motion pictures ever made in Hollywood. After directing scores of silent films, including the first film to be released by Universal Pictures, Ricketts became a prominent character actor.\\n\\n- A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.\\n\\n- An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.\\n\\n- A character actor or character actress is a supporting actor who plays unusual, interesting, or eccentric characters. The term, often contrasted with that of leading actor, is somewhat abstract and open to interpretation. In a literal sense, all actors can be considered character actors since they all play \\"characters\\", but in the usual sense it is an actor who plays a distinctive and important supporting role. \\n\\n- Ebenezer Scrooge is the focal character of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, \\"A Christmas Carol\\".\\nAt the beginning of the novella, Scrooge is a cold-hearted miser who despises Christmas. Dickens describes him thus: \\"The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, made his eyes red, his thin lips blue, and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice, bah humbug.\\"\\n\\n- The Shriner's Daughter is a 1913 American silent short film starring Charlotte Burton, Violet Neitz, Helen Armstrong, William Bertram, Edith Borella, Ed Coxen, Reaves Eason, George Field, Winifred Greenwood, Ida Lewis, Nina Richdale and William Tedmarsh.\\n\\n- Winifred Greenwood (January 1, 1885, Geneseo, New York November 23, 1961, Woodland Hills, California) was an American silent film actress.\\nShe was signed in 1910 and starred in over 200 films before her retirement in 1927.

Passage 1:Cecan was born among the Romanians of Novoselitsa (Noua Suliță or Novoselytsia) or Beleuța village, Hotin County. Both were located in the northern tip of the Bessarabia Governorate, Russia (now in Chernivtsi Oblast, Ukraine). His native area had been split from ancient Moldavia; Western Moldavia remained in Romania, whereas the Moldavian sub-region of Bukovina, just west of Novoselitsa, was administered by Austria-Hungary. Ieremia Teodor's original surname was Ciocan (\\"hammer\\"), which was approximated into Russian as Chekan, then mutated back into Romanian as Cecan. He went on to study in Kishinev (Chișinău), training at the Theological Seminary (in 1889) and then being assigned the central Bessarabian parish of Nișcani. Later on, he furthered his studies in theology at Kiev Academy. He became a passionate reader and follower of Vladimir Solovyov, as well as a speaker for the reunification of Orthodoxy and Catholicism. In his later articles on the subject, Cecan favored leniency toward the use of Filioque in the Nicene Creed and accepted the doctrine of papal infallibility.\\n Passage 2:Geoffrey Alan Millar (born 22 November 1955) is a former Australian cricketer who played several matches for Western Australia during the early 1980s.

He made his Sheffield Shield debut for Western Australia during the 1981–82 competition, and failed to take a wicket in what was to be his only first-class match. In the match, against Queensland at the WACA Ground in February 1982, he was part of a pace attack that included David Boyd (who he opened the bowling with in the first innings), Mick Malone, and Ken MacLeay. Millar also appeared at List A level several times for Western Australia. In his first match, the third-place playoff of the 1981–82 McDonald's Cup, he took 2/17 and scored 30 runs, and was thus named man of the match. His two further matches both occurred in the following year's tournament.

At an unknown date in 1877, she went ashore near Alpena, Michigan, and was repaired afterwards in Detroit, Michigan. In 1879 the Baldwin was sold to the Inter Ocean Transportation Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In April, 1882 she was sold to David Whitney Jr. of Detroit, Michigan, and her second deck was removed in order to refit her for the lumber trade. after the refit, the Baldwin gross tonnage was reevaluated to 412.5 tons. In 1884 it was reported that she was damaged near Ashland, Wisconsin.

This phenomenon, known as pleiotropy, is a major constraint on evolution because adaptive change in one trait may be prevented because it would compromise other traits affected by the same genes. Here we show that pleiotropy can have an unexpected effect and benefit one of the most enigmatic of adaptations—cooperation. A spectacular act of cooperation occurs in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, in which some cells die to form a stalk that holds the other cells aloft as reproductive spores. We have identified a gene, dimA, in D. discoideum that has two contrasting effects. It is required to receive the signalling molecule DIF-1 that causes differentiation into prestalk cells. Ignoring DIF-1 and not becoming prestalk should allow cells to cheat by avoiding the stalk. However, we find that in aggregations containing the wild-type cells, lack of the dimA gene results in exclusion from spores. This pleiotropic linkage of stalk and spore formation limits the potential for cheating in D. discoideum because defecting on prestalk cell production results in an even greater reduction in spores. We propose that the evolution of pleiotropic links between cheating and personal costs can stabilize cooperative adaptations.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not contain a topic sentence, but instead jumps right into the explanation of how the gene dimA has two contrasting effects on cell differentiation.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45.

In this paper, we propose the SuperTML method, which borrows the idea of Super Characters method and two-dimensional embedding to address the problem of classification on tabular data. For each input of tabular data, the features are first projected into two-dimensional embedding like an image, and then this image is fed into fine-tuned ImageNet CNN models for classification. Experimental results have shown that the proposed SuperTML method have achieved state-of-the-art results on both large and small datasets.","target":"Deep learning for structured tabular data machine learning using pre-trained CNN model from ImageNet","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nDeep learning for structured tabular data machine learning using pre-trained CNN model from ImageNet."},{"source":"Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future.

POST : We'd been friends for 8 years and she had a hard life and went through a lot of shit in her life - narcissistic mother who was manipulative and kicked her out often until she managed to move out at 20ish years old. I tried my best to be there for her and support her, talking and letting her stay over my uni house for a couple days and so on.\\n\\nWe lost contact for a bit but then reconnected when I was in the final year of my undergraduate and began my masters. I lived an hour away by train.\\n\\nWe messaged everyday, met up and played video games often but gradually I became busier and struggled more with my mental health. I cancelled on meeting up more often than I would go and wouldn't have time for video games or two hour phone calls.\\n\\nShe got tired with me not giving her enough attention and we had an argument over me not spending enough time with her. I apologised and promised it wouldn't happen again. I worked hard to meet up and play video games over the coming months.\\n\\nBut unfortunately my mental health decreased further with increased stress from my Masters course, working 3 days a week and struggling with self harm and feelings of suicide. I made sure that I messaged her every day to stay in touch but had to consistently turn down gaming requests and phone calls - which would be a minimum of 2 hours. I was barely surviving getting out of bed, working on my thesis and eating. I hadn't even switched on my tv or hung out with uni friends for the past two months.\\n\\nA week before my birthday and deadline for my thesis project, I get a message after cancelling on a meet up i made in a brief moment of positivity, telling me that she deserves better people in her life, has tried to be there for me but needs to think of herself, then calls me a selfish bitch and that she needs a friend now and cant wait another second. \\n\\nI begged for another chance, promised to change and cried my eyes out, but she said goodbye.\\n\\n\\n I graduated and moved back home a week later. Some time passed with no contact other than her liking my photos on Instagram. I was mad that she thought she could cut me out of her life that way and then continue to like my photos, so I blocked her.\\n\\nShe confronted me about blocking her and then we spoke again about what happened and she tried to understand my side of the story, apologised for what she said and I accepted and apologised for not thinking of her feelings and how me not spending time with her made her feel, especially considering her anxiety, depression and abandonment issues stemming from her mother. \\n\\nBut I was still absolutely furious about what had happened and grieved the loss of the friendship. \\n\\nWe spoke for a bit but i realised that i hadnt forgiven her for the way she treated me. I went on a night out with my old school friends and it made me realise that even though we'd (school friends) met up 3-4 times a year and spoken infrequently, we all were just thrilled to see each other and understood that life gets in the way but doesn't affect our friendship and love for each other. Even when I'd cancelled on meeting up with them more often than not and they had done the same to me.\\n\\nI got drunk and angry, reread all the old messages and sent a strongly worded text telling my best friend to go fuck herself, that it was over. She was draining and self-centred. I'm not the meek little mousy girl who would follow her around anymore and be treated like shit at the worst and lowest moment of my life.\\n\\nFurther texts were sent back and forth and I didn't hold back. I was a dick about it.

Two hundred forty-one patients with dilation of 271 coronary sites were randomized at the time of hospital discharge to receive nifedipine, 10 mg (123 patients), or placebo (118 patients) four times daily for 6 months. No patient was known to have coronary artery spasm. The mean duration of therapy was 4.4 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) months for nifedipine and 4.3 +/- 2 months for placebo. A restudy angiogram was available in 100 patients (81%) in the nifedipine group and 98 patients (83%) in the placebo group. A recurrent coronary stenosis was noted in 28% of patients in the nifedipine group and in 29.5% of those in the placebo group (p = NS). The mean diameter stenosis was 36.4 +/- 23% for the nifedipine group and 36.7 +/- 23% for the placebo group (p = NS). By pill count, 78% of patients receiving nifedipine and 82% of those receiving placebo complied with the study drug regimen.

Formed on the third iteration of MTV's Making the Band reality television series in 2005, they were soon signed to Bad Boy Records by Diddy. Danity Kane's self-titled debut studio album was released in 2006 and achieved success in the United States, shipping a million copies domestically, while spawning two singles with top 10 single \\"Show Stopper\\" and the ballad \\"Ride for You.\\" Their second studio album, Welcome to the Dollhouse, was released in 2008, following the release of their second top 10 single \\"Damaged\\".\\n\\nIn 2004, producer Sean Combs returned with Making the Band 3, the third iteration of the Making the Band television series, in search of the next female supergroup. With the help of choreographer Laurie Ann Gibson, vocal trainer Doc Holiday and talent manager Johnny Wright, he set out on a multi-city search and invited 20 young singers out of almost 10,000 young women to live and compete for positions in the group in New York City. When seven women remained, Combs became discontent with the level of talent remaining in the competition and decided not to form a band. He did, however, feel three contestants deserved another chance, including then-best friends Aubrey O'Day and Aundrea Fimbres, whose close bond originally formed early in the season. The three contestants became the first to appear in season 2 of the show.  At the start of the second season, Combs once again pressed his team to audition new young women for the group. Finally, 20 young women were chosen and moved into a loft in New York City. Viewers had become invested in O'Day and Fimbres's friendship, naming them \\"the AUs\\" and \\"Aubrea\\" (portmanteux of their first names put together), as they watched the two compete all over again for positions in the group. As the competition's challenges increased, their friendship seemed to become the foundation upon which the group was being built. In addition, O'Day emerged as the show's breakout star.  After weeks of dance and singing lessons, promotional appearances, and a performance in front of 10,000 at a Backstreet Boys concert at Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, VA, 11 contestants remained, including O'Day and Fimbres. The finalists were sent home for three months, told to polish up, and return for the final stretch in November 2005.  On the second season's finale, on Monday, November 15, 2005, the show's ratings broke MTV records as millions of viewers watched to see the group officially formed. Five of the 11 remaining contestants were chosen: O'Day first, Wanita \\"D. Woods\\" Woodgett second, Shannon Bex third, Dawn Richard fourth, and Fimbres last.  The third season of Making the Band 3 tracked the development and struggles of the new band -- from then on known as \\"Danity Kane\\" (a name taken from a female anime superhero created and drawn by Richard).

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459).

Coincidentally, the moon's rotation period is also a little under 28 days, meaning the same face points toward the earth during its entire orbit. When the moon is between the Earth and the sun, during the new moon phase, the back side of the moon is bathed in daylight. The orbit and the rotation aren't perfectly matched, however. The moon travels around the Earth in an elliptical orbit, a slightly stretched-out circle. When the moon is closest to Earth, its rotation is slower than its journey through space, allowing observers to see an additional 8 degrees on the eastern side. Why does the Earth and the moon remain in orbit? Inertia and gravity combine to keep Earth in orbit around the sun and the moon in orbit around the Earth.

The time it takes the Earth to rotate once is called a day (24 hours). The actual rotation time is a little less, about 23 hours and 56 minutes. If you ignore the earth's orbit around the sun, the moon takes 27.32 days to go 360 degrees around us. In other words, the time it takes to cover 360 degrees of the celestial sphere. But since we orbit the sun, the moon has to travel farther than 360 degrees to reach the same point, with respect to the earth and sun. (It's about an extra 28 degrees). Since we notice phases much more than what stars we see the moon against, the phase cycle of 29.5 days is the one most commonly used. v. an object that orbits the sun, is large enough to have become rounded by its own gravity and has cleared the area of its orbit. planet. v. bright streak of light produced when a small object burns up entering the Earth's atmosphere.

Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering.

Although North Carolina's plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than that of Virginia, Georgia, or South Carolina, significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and Durham in the Piedmont.

The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but an attribution to John Bull is sometimes made. It is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977, as well as for several of the UK's territories that have their own additional local anthem. It is also the royal anthem - played specifically in the presence of the monarch - of all the aforementioned countries, as well as Australia (since 1984), Canada (since 1980), Barbados and Tuvalu.\\n\\n\\"God Save the Queen\\" is the national anthem of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Like many aspects of British constitutional life, its official status derives from custom and use, not from Royal Proclamation or Act of Parliament. In general only one or two verses are sung, but on rare occasions three. The variation in the UK of the lyrics to \\"God Save the Queen\\" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied throughout these years.  England has no official national anthem of its own; \\"God Save the Queen\\" is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where Jerusalem is used). There is a movement to establish an English national anthem, with Blake and Parry's \\"Jerusalem\\" and Elgar's \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\" among the top contenders. Scotland has its own national song and Wales has its own national anthem for political and national events and for use at international football, rugby union and other sports in which those nations compete independently. On all occasions Wales' national anthem is \\"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\\" (Land of my Fathers). Scotland has no single anthem; \\"Scotland the Brave\\" was traditionally used until the 1990s, when \\"Flower of Scotland\\" was adopted. In Northern Ireland, \\"God Save the Queen\\" is still used as the official anthem.  The phrase \\"No surrender\\" is occasionally sung in the bridge before \\"Send her victorious\\" by England football fans at matches. The phrase \\"no surrender\\" is also associated with Combat 18, a white supremacist group. The phrase is also associated with Ulster loyalism and can sometimes be heard at the same point before Northern Ireland football matches.  Since 2003, \\"God Save the Queen\\", considered an all inclusive Anthem for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as other countries within the Commonwealth, has been dropped from the Commonwealth Games. Northern Irish athletes receive their gold medals to the tune of the \\"Londonderry Air\\", popularly known as \\"Danny Boy\\". In 2006, English winners heard Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1, usually known as \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", but after a poll conducted by the Commonwealth Games Council for England prior to the 2010 Games, \\"Jerusalem\\" was adopted as England's new Commonwealth Games anthem. In sports in which the UK competes as one nation, most notably as Great Britain at the Olympics, \\"God Save the Queen\\" is used to represent anyone or any team that comes from the United Kingdom.\\n\\nTell me more about the movement for the anthem?","target":"Blake and Parry's \\"Jerusalem\\" and Elgar's \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\" among the top contenders.","rationale":"The article states that England has no official national anthem of its own and \\"God Save the Queen\\" is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where Jerusalem is used).

They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than $25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- $3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum number of people in the shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar[citation needed]. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in Brierley Hill near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff.

The exceptions to this are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4, which each specify a single flute.

If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Greg is is a chef.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network.

The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999).

The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right?\\nThe living simply did not understand that there were rules.

Passage 1:The 1977 Atocha massacre, a part of neo-fascist terrorism in Spain, was an attack during the Spanish transition to democracy after the death of Franco in 1975, killing five and injuring four. It was committed on January 24, 1977, in an office located on 55 Atocha Street near the Atocha railway station in Madrid, where specialists in labour law, members of the Workers' Commissions (Comisiones Obreras, CCOO) trade union, and of the then-clandestine Communist Party of Spain (PCE) had gathered. The next day, the massacre was defended by a group calling itself Alianza Apostólica Anticomunista (literally Apostolic Anticommunist Alliance, abbreviated Triple A or AAA). The suspects arrested were close to Blas Piñar's Fuerza Nueva far-right party, the Falange-JONS and the Franco Guard. The indignation brought about by the killings accelerated the legalisation of the Communist party, which took place in Easter 1977. On March 24, 1984, the Italian daily Il Messaggero stated that, possibly, Italian neo-fascists had taken part in the shootings, pointing toward some kind of \\"Black International\\". This allegation was confirmed by a report from the Italian CESIS, which confirmed that Carlo Cicuttini, who was also involved in the Peteano massacre, took part in the Atocha massacre.\\n Passage 2:The 8th Viscount Irvine was the sixth son of Arthur Ingram, 3rd Viscount of Irvine (died 1702), of Temple Newsam, Yorkshire, and his wife Isabella Machell, daughter of John Machell, Member of Parliament for Horsham, of Hills (Horsham), Sussex, and Helen Warmestry. Baptized at Whitkirk, Yorkshire, he matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford on 7 June 1711, at the age of 17, and graduated BA in 1714. He obtained a Fellowship in the same college in 1716, took MA in 1717, and was ordained deacon at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford by Bishop John Potter on 21 December 1718. At Westminster St James he was ordained priest on 8 February following, by Bishop Talbot of Salisbury, and three days later was instituted Rector of Crudwell, Wiltshire, a living which he held until his death. In October 1723 he was also instituted to the perpetual vicarage of Hankerton, Wiltshire. (Both Crudwell and Hankerton are parishes near Malmesbury.) He was appointed chaplain of the House of Commons in 1724, and was installed canon of Windsor and Prebendary of Westminster.\\n Passage 3:He began his 1997 career with Levallois SC and joined in summer 1999 to PSG. In January 2003 was promoted to Paris Saint-Germain and played in his first professional season 3 games in the Ligue 1.

A detachment of 10th Cavalry would fight one of their last battles of the Apache Wars north of Globe at the Salt River during an expedition on 7 March 1890. After the battle Sergeant William McBryar, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the pursuit of the Apache warriors.

Pershing  commanded a troop from Fort Assinniboine in north central Montana. Pershing commanded an expedition to the south and southwest that rounded up and deported a large number of Cree Indians to Canada. In summary, from 1866 to the early 1890s, the 10th Cavalry Regiment served at a variety of posts in the Southwestern United States  and Great Plains regions. They participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record.

After entering the game with the 6th best record in the AFC, the loss was a blow to the Chargers' (8-6) playoff chances. It was their second consecutive home loss to the two teams tied for the best record in their conference. Denver's Manning threw a scoring pass to Demaryius Thomas at the end of the third quarter for their only touchdown of the game. The Chargers pulled to within six points at 16-10 after a TD catch by Gates with 10 minutes left. The Chargers trailed only 9-3 at the half after holding the Broncos to a field goal each time they entered the red zone. Manning was sick coming into the game, and left late in the second quarter with a thigh injury. Set up by a 58-yard punt return by Royal, Novak kicked a 30-yard field goal before the half ended for the Chargers' first score. Manning began the third quarter, and finished the game completing 14 of 20 passes for 233 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. Novak missed two field goals in the game: a 46-yard attempt that was tipped by Derek Wolfe in the second quarter, and a 37-yard attempt that hit the left upright in the third. The Chargers were using a new holder with punter Mat McBriar, who was replacing the injured Scifres, but Novak refused to use it as an excuse. Novak placed the blame of the loss on himself, whose missed kicks would have tied the score and kept the game in reach. Rivers completed 24 of 41 attempts for 232 yards with two interceptions. Gates' touchdown was his 10th of the season, tying him with Gronkowski for most seasons with at least 10 touchdown catches by a tight end. Allen exited the game in the third quarter after suffering both a broken right collarbone and an injured right ankle in the second quarter; the collarbone sidelined him for the final two games of the season.

Founding member DJ Terminator X left the group in 1999. Formed on Long Island, New York, in 1986, they are known for their politically charged music and criticism of the American media, with an active interest in the frustrations and concerns of the African American community. Their first four albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were all certified either gold or platinum and were, according to music critic Robert Hilburn in 1998, \\"the most acclaimed body of work ever by a hip hop act\\".\\n\\nTheir debut album, Yo! Bum Rush the Show, was released in 1987 to critical acclaim. The album was the group's first step toward stardom. In October 1987, music critic Simon Reynolds dubbed Public Enemy \\"a superlative rock band\\". They released their second album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back in 1988, which performed better in the charts than their previous release, and included the hit single \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\" in addition to \\"Bring the Noise\\". Nation of Millions... was the first hip hop album to be voted album of the year in The Village Voice's influential Pazz & Jop critics' poll.  In 1989, the group returned to the studio to record Fear of a Black Planet, which continued their politically charged themes. The album was supposed to be released in late 1989, but was pushed back to April 1990. It was the most successful of any of their albums and, in 2005, was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress. It included the singles \\"Welcome To The Terrordome\\", \\"911 Is a Joke\\", which criticized emergency response units for taking longer to arrive at emergencies in the black community than those in the white community, and \\"Fight the Power\\". \\"Fight the Power\\" is regarded as one of the most popular and influential songs in hip hop history. It was the theme song of Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing.  The group's next release, Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black, continued this trend, with songs like \\"Can't Truss It\\", which addressed the history of slavery and how the black community can fight back against oppression; \\"I Don't Wanna be Called Yo Nigga\\", a track that takes issue with the use of the word nigga outside of its original derogatory context. The album also included the controversial song and video \\"By the Time I Get to Arizona\\", which chronicled the black community's frustration that some US states did not recognize Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a national holiday. The video featured members of Public Enemy taking out their frustrations on politicians in the states not recognizing the holiday. In 1992, the group was one of the first rap acts to perform at the Reading Festival, in England, headlining the second day of the three-day festival.\\n\\nWhat hit singles did the album had?","target":"Can't Truss It","rationale":"The context contains a description of the album \\"Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black\\".

The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.\\nWhile the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves.

Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749.\\nAside from the over-enthusiastic dissection of the body and the boiling of the bones in situ, the image portrays the procedure as it would have been carried out.Two skeletons to the rear left and right of the print are labelled as James Field, a well-known boxer who..., what would be the answer ?","target":"Bosavern Penlez","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"Bosavern Penlez is mentioned in a high-profile attempt to secure his body for dissection\\"."},{"source":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: \\n\\nQ: What do I cook on the stove when I want to make tacos?\\nPossible A: brown meat, mexico, open can, bake bread, warm food\\n\\nWhy is \\"brown meat\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","target":"tacos are often made using meat","rationale":"The rationale for \\"brown meat\\" is that tacos are often made using meat.\\n\`, 'utf8');"},{"source":"What is the title of this article:\\n\\nUnder Walter Dill Scott's presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by James Gamble Rogers to house the professional schools; established the Kellogg School of Management; and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus, Dyche Stadium (now named Ryan Field) and Deering Library among others.

For coronaviruses, this critical step is governed by the virally-encoded spike (S) protein, a class I viral fusion protein that has several unique features. Coronavirus entry is unusual in that it is often biphasic in nature, and can occur at or near the cell surface or in late endosomes. Recent advances in structural, biochemical and molecular biology of the coronavirus S protein has shed light on the intricacies of coronavirus entry, in particular the molecular triggers of coronavirus S-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, characterization of the coronavirus fusion peptide (FP), the segment of the fusion protein that inserts to a target lipid bilayer during membrane fusion, has revealed its particular attributes which imparts some of the unusual properties of the S protein, such as Ca 2+ -dependency. These unusual characteristics can explain at least in part the biphasic nature of coronavirus entry. In this review, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as model virus, we give an overview of advances in research on the coronavirus fusion peptide with an emphasis on its role and properties within the biological context of host cell entry. \\n Title: Physiological and molecular triggers for SARS-CoV membrane fusion and entry into host cells","target":"True","rationale":"The title provides an overview of research on the coronavirus fusion peptide, with an emphasis on its role and properties during host cell entry.

In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date. Several difficulties were detailed, including the fact that Parker denied any knowledge of the crime, as did others who were believed to have heard the incident, discussed in Brown's presence.

Originally the Spanish territory of \\"La Florida\\", and later the provinces of East and West Florida, it was ceded to the United States as part of the 1819 Adams-Onís Treaty. It was governed by the Florida Territorial Council.\\n\\n- A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.\\n\\n- The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.\\n\\n- Tallahassee is the capital of the U.S. state of Florida. It is the county seat and only incorporated municipality in Leon County. Tallahassee became the capital of Florida, then the Florida Territory, in 1824. In 2015, the population was 189,907, making the city the 126th-largest city in the United States. The population of the Tallahassee metropolitan area was 377,924 as of 2015. Tallahassee is the largest city in the Northwest Florida region as well as the main center for trade and agriculture in the Florida Big Bend and Southwest Georgia regions.\\n\\n- Southwest Georgia is a fourteen-county region in the U.S. state of Georgia. It has a 2010 census population of 496,433, and is the least populated region in Georgia, just slightly behind Southeast Georgia.

The group resulted from the merger of local acts Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. With their line-up solidified, the first two songs they wrote together was \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\" and \\"Three Cheers for Five Years\\". Soon afterwards, they recorded an EP, \\"Tales Told by Dead Friends\\", with Lee Dyess. The group followed Warped Tour and sold copies to people in line. By the end of summer, the band had sold 10,000 copies of the EP. This attracted the attention of Fearless Records, who would sign the band in late August. The group went on tour from September to November, before the EP was reissued by Fearless.\\n\\n- The Warped Tour is a traveling rock festival that has toured the United States (including 3 or 4 stops in Canada) annually each summer since 1995. It is the largest traveling music festival in the United States, and is the longest-running touring music festival in North America. The first Warped Tour took place in 1995, and the skateboard shoe manufacturer Vans became the main sponsor of the tour starting with the second tour in 1996, when it became known as the Vans Warped Tour. Although Vans has continued to be the main sponsor and lend its name to the festival, other sponsors have also participated, with stages or other aspects of the festival sometimes being named after them.\\n\\n- A Lesson in Romantics is the debut studio album by American rock band Mayday Parade. The band resulted from the merger of Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. In June 2006 the band released an EP, \\"Tales Told by Dead Friends\\", which they sold to people by following the 2006 edition of Warped Tour and offering copies; it eventually sold 10,000 copies. The band signed to Fearless Records in August. \\"A Lesson in Romantics\\" was recorded in early 2007 with producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount. Vocalist/guitarist Jason Lancaster left the band in March 2007 citing a lack of writing credit on the band's releases. Prior to the release of \\"A Lesson in Romantics\\", \\"Black Cat\\", \\"When I Get Home, You're So Dead\\", and \\"Jamie All Over\\" were made available for streaming. After the album's release, the band participated in the 2007 edition of Warped Tour.\\n\\n- Fearless Records is a record label that was founded in 1994.

However, the label has experimented with different styles in recent years. Acts like Blessthefall, The Word Alive, Motionless in White, Ice Nine Kills, Mayday Parade, Pierce The Veil, Tonight Alive and The Color Morale have showcased post-hardcore, metalcore and alternative rock bands that have emerged in recent years.

Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- Kingfishers are a group of small to medium-sized, brightly colored birds in the order Coraciiformes. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species found outside of the Americas. The group is treated either as a single family, the Alcedinidae, or as a suborder Alcedines containing three families, Alcedinidae (river kingfishers), Halcyonidae (tree kingfishers), and Cerylidae (water kingfishers). Roughly 90 species of kingfishers are described. All have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with few differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests. They consume a wide range of prey, as well as fish, usually caught by swooping down from a perch. While kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish, most species live away from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other members of their order, they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of all kingfishers nest in abandoned termite nests. A few species, principally insular forms, are threatened with extinction. In Britain, the word \\"kingfisher\\" normally refers to the common kingfisher.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- The African pygmy kingfisher (\\"Ispidina picta\\") is a small insectivorous kingfisher found in the Afrotropics, mostly in woodland habitats. Some texts refer to this species as \\"Ceyx pictus\\".\\n\\n- Woodland is a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade. Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession. Higher density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are referred to as forests. \\n\\n- Ispidina is a genus of very small insectivorous African water kingfishers .

Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that the group \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.\\" The lyrics of the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and \\"the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all\\", in contrast to \\"humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same.\\" Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy Society of the Spectacle by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\". Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx.

The paragraph is about a musical band called Stereolab and how their lyrics are politically charged, sometimes even Marxist as claimed by some critics. However, this example question focuses more on one member who has apparently read very little Marx but reads someone else’s work extensively - Castoriadis (socialisme ou barbarie). According to the text, Sadier’s thinking has been marked by him so much that she named her side project after his name (Monade) and titled her debut album Socialisme ou Barbarie which is also reference to the work of Castoriadis.

Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection.

For example, it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes, and vice versa. This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century, such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud, as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves. However, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and, through the second half of the twentieth century, gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations.

Visible light is produced by vibrations and rotations of atoms and molecules, as well as by electronic transitions within atoms and molecules.

Figure 24.16 shows this part of the spectrum, together with the colors associated with particular pure wavelengths. We usually refer to visible light as having wavelengths of between 400 nm and 750 nm. (The retina of the eye actually responds to the lowest ultraviolet frequencies, but these do not normally reach the retina because they are absorbed by the cornea and lens of the eye. ) Red light has the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths, while violet has the highest frequencies and shortest wavelengths.

The emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV) causes severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans, with high fatality rates. Nipah virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, posing a high risk for epidemic outbreaks. However, a broadly applicable approach for human NiV outbreaks in field settings is lacking. Methods. We engineered new antiviral lipopeptides and analyzed in vitro fusion inhibition to identify an optimal candidate for prophylaxis of NiV infection in the lower respiratory tract, and we assessed antiviral efficiency in 2 different animal models. Results. We show that lethal NiV infection can be prevented with lipopeptides delivered via the respiratory route in both hamsters and nonhuman primates. By targeting retention of peptides for NiV prophylaxis in the respiratory tract, we avoid its systemic delivery in individuals who need only prevention, and thus we increase the safety of treatment and enhance utility of the intervention. Conclusions. The experiments provide a proof of concept for the use of antifusion lipopeptides for prophylaxis of lethal NiV. These results advance the goal of rational development of potent lipopeptide inhibitors with desirable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties and a safe effective delivery method to target NiV and other pathogenic viruses. \\n Title: Fusion Inhibitory Lipopeptides Engineered for Prophylaxis of Nipah Virus in Primates","target":"True","rationale":"The title provides a concise description of the main findings and focus of the study.

He grew up in the North End neighborhood of Winnipeg, an area with a large concentration of Eastern European immigrants. From his early days at Machray Elementary School through his teenage years at St. John's High School, Slotin was academically exceptional. His younger brother, Sam, later remarked that his brother \\"had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study long hours.\\"\\n\\nThe radiation doses received in these two accidents are not known with any semblance of accuracy. A large part of the dose was due to neutron radiation, which could not be measured by dosimetry equipment of the day. The available equipment, film badges, were not worn by personnel during the accident, and badges that were supposed to be planted under tables in case of disasters like these were not found. Disaster badges hung on the walls did provide some useful data about gamma radiation.  A \\"tentative\\" estimate of the doses involved was made in 1948, based on dozens of assumptions, some of which are now known to be grossly incorrect. In the absence of personal dosimetry badges, the study authors relied on measurements of sodium activation in the victims' blood and urine samples as their primary source of data. This activation would have been caused by neutron radiation, but they converted all doses to equivalent doses of gamma or X-ray radiation. They concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to 290 and 880 rem (respectively) of gamma rays. Minimum and maximum estimates varied from about 50% to 200% of these values. The authors also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80 keV X-rays and gamma rays, which they believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than the gamma equivalent. In this model the equivalent X-ray doses were much higher, but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source, whereas the gamma component penetrated the whole body. Slotin's equivalent dose was estimated to be 1930 R (roentgen) of X-ray with 114 R of gamma, while Daghlian's equivalent dose was estimated to be 480 R of X-ray with 110 R of gamma. Five hundred rem is usually a fatal dose for humans.  In modern times dosimetry is done very differently. Equivalent doses would not be reported in roentgen; they would be calculated with different weighting factors, and they are not considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as absorbed doses. Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin's dose, ranging from 287 rad to 21 sievert. Based on citations and supporting reasoning, the most reliable estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10 Gy(n) + 1.14 Gy(g) for Slotin and 2 Gy(n) + 1.1 Gy(g) for Daghlian. These doses are consistent with the symptoms they experienced.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Louis Slotin","rationale":"The given excerpt is about Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who took part in the Manhattan Project.

By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japan and Mainland China have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding hanja characters.\\n\\n- The Gabo Reform, also known as the Kabo Reform, describes a series of sweeping reforms suggested to the government of Korea beginning in 1894 and ending in 1896 during the reign of Gojong of Korea in response to the Donghak Peasant Revolution. Historians debate the degree of Japanese influence in this program, as well as its effect in encouraging modernization. The name Gabo (, ) comes from the name of the year 1894 in the traditional sexagenary cycle.\\n\\n- A posthumous name is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in East Asia after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during his life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan.\\n\\n- Goryeo, also spelled as Kory (9181392), was a Korean dynasty established in 918 by King Taejo. This kingdom later gave name to the modern exonym \\"Korea\\". It united the Later Three Kingdoms in 936 and ruled most of the Korean Peninsula until it was removed by the founder of the Joseon in 1392. Goryeo expanded Korea's borders to present-day Wonsan in the northeast (936943), the Yalu River (993) and finally almost the whole of the Korean Peninsula (1374).\\n\\n- The House of Yi , also called the Korean Imperial Household or Jeonju Yi clan , was the household of Joseon and the Korean Empire , consisting of the descendants of Yi Seonggye , the founder of Joseon , known by his posthumous name , Taejo ( \`\` highest ancestor '' ) . All his descendants are members of the Jeonju Yi clan , including the imperial family of the Korean Empire ( 1897 -- 1910 ) . After the Japan -- Korea Treaty of 1910 , in which the Empire of Japan annexed the Korean Peninsula , some members of the Yi clan were mediatised into the Imperial House of Japan and the Japanese peerage by the Japanese government until 1947 , just before the Constitution of Japan was promulgated . Since then , their status as royalty has not been acknowledged by any country ; however , they continue to attract occasional media attention in South Korea . This happened most recently with the July 2005 funeral of Yi Gu , former head of the royal household . At present , three members claim themselves as heirs to the throne . Yi Won , a first cousin and the son of the 9th son of Prince Ui , has posthumously adopted as son of Gu by the house members ' decision , thus regarded as de facto head of the house . Yi Hae - won , his aunt and second eldest daughter of Prince Ui , was declared as the empress by some of the house members at 2006 . Yi Seok , another son of Prince Ui , leads independent imperial restorationist organization and recognized as an heir .\\n\\n- Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\").

When Stewart was three years old, the family moved to Nutley.

The day following her sale, the stock value fell 16%.  In the months that followed, Stewart drew heavy media scrutiny, including a Newsweek cover headlined \\"Martha's Mess\\". Notably, on June 25, 2002, CBS anchor Jane Clayson grilled Stewart on the air about ImClone during her regular segment on The Early Show. Stewart continued chopping cabbage and responded: \\"I want to focus on my salad.\\" On October 3, 2002, Stewart resigned her position, held for four months, on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange, following a deal prosecutors had made with Douglas Faneuil, an assistant to Bacanovic.  On June 4, 2003, Stewart was indicted by the government on nine counts, including charges of securities fraud and obstruction of justice. Stewart voluntarily stepped down as CEO and Chairwoman of MSLO, but stayed on as chief creative officer. She went on trial in January 2004. Prosecutors showed that Bacanovic had ordered his assistant to tell Stewart that the CEO of ImClone, Samuel D. Waksal, was selling all his shares in advance of an adverse Food and Drug Administration ruling. The FDA action was expected to cause ImClone shares to decline.

The singles \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" and \\"Bang and Blame\\" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from Monster reached the Top 30 on the British charts. Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from Automatic for the People for release as Parallel in 1995.In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was only the beginning of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album.

The validity of employing commonly accepted analog smoothing methods was also appraised. An inert gravitational model was used to assess the filtering requirements of two Cybex II constant velocity dynamometers at 10 pre-set speeds with three selected loads. Speed settings were recorded as percentages of the servomechanism's maximum tachometer feedback voltage (10 to 100% Vfb max). Spectral analyses of unsmoothed torque and associated angular displacement curves, followed by optimized low-pass digital filtering, revealed the presence of two superimposed contaminating influences: a damped oscillation, representing successive sudden braking and releasing of the servomechanism control system; a relatively stationary oscillatory series, which was attributed to the Cybex motor. The optimal cutoff frequency for any data set was principally a positive function of % Vfb max. This association was represented for each machine by a different, but reliable, third order least-squares polynomial, which could be used to accurately predict the correct smoothing required for any speed setting. Unacceptable errors may be induced, especially when measuring peak torques, if data are inappropriately filtered. Over-smoothing disguises inertial artefacts. The use of Cybex recorder damping settings should be discouraged. Optimal filtering is a minimal requirement of valid data processing. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Optimal filtering of constant velocity torque data. option2: Impending cardiac herniation: the snow cone sign.","target":"Optimal filtering of constant velocity torque data","rationale":"Given the abstract, the title should describe its contents.

He shows his son how to properly blow the engine's horn to clear the streets and intersections on their way to the site.When they arrive on site, the call is for an apartment building. Brian watches as his father quickly makes his way up to the top floor where the blaze is. He and his partner, John \\"Axe\\" Adcox, rescue a kid about Brian's age and give him to their cohorts waiting on a nearby ladder. McCaffrey and Axe continuing battling the fire when a gas line ruptures and the entire floor explodes, killing McCaffrey. Brian watches his father's helmet land in front of him on the street. Axe, pushed away from the explosion by McCaffrey, rushes out and hugs Brian, then appears to bark orders to the rest of the company. Brian is stunned and picks up his father's helmet just as a photographer snaps a picture of him. (The picture later becomes a prize-winning cover of Life magazine.)Twenty years later, in the present day, Brian is at a party being thrown at a local bar; he has just graduated from a firefighter's training academy and the class is celebrating. He and his friend, Tim, are also waiting for their station assignments. Tim is given Engine 17, the toughest company in the city. Brian's own assignment is elsewhere because he'd bribed the city fire chief. Brian doesn't want to work for 17 because his older brother, Steven, runs the house and the two have become estranged. At the party, Brian also meets up with his old girlfriend, Jennifer, who isn't very happy to see him; Brian has hardly made any effort to keep in touch with her or his family for several years.

By the end of 1983, 4505 arthroplasties for osteoarthritis and 3495 for rheumatoid arthritis had been recorded and reviewed one, three and six years after the operation. Using actuarial methods, the probability of the prosthesis remaining in situ after six years was calculated. In osteoarthritis this probability ranged from 65% for hinged prostheses to 90% for medial compartment prostheses. Two-and three-compartment prostheses produced intermediate results with 87% survival. In rheumatoid arthritis the probability varied from 72% for medial compartment prostheses to 90% for two- and three-compartment prostheses. The main reason for failure was loosening of the components, the second most common was infection. The probability of revision for infection by six years was 2% in osteoarthritis and 3% in rheumatoid arthritis. Most revisions were to a three-compartment prosthesis. Knee fusion at primary revision was required in 2% of the cases at six years.","target":"Arthritis, Rheumatoid","rationale":"The abstract describes a nationwide study of knee arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and the results of the study indicate that the survival rate of prosthetic knee replacements varies by type, being highest for medial compartment prostheses (90%) and lowest for hinged prostheses (65%) in osteoarthritis patients.

Known as \\"Old Fuss and Feathers\\" and the \\"Grand Old Man of the Army\\", he served on active duty as a general longer than any other person in American history, is rated as one of the Army's most senior commissioned officers, and is ranked by many historians as the best American commander of his time. Over the course of his 53-year career, he commanded forces in the War of 1812, the Black Hawk War, the Mexican-American War, and the Second Seminole War. He was the army's senior officer at the start of the American Civil War, and conceived the Union strategy known as the Anaconda Plan, which was used to defeat the Confederacy.\\n\\nFrom the War of 1812 until he became commanding general of the U.S. Army in 1841, Scott maintained a rivalry with Brevet Major General Edmund P. Gaines. The central issue was the question of which had seniority; should brevet ranks count, which would favor Scott, or were regular Army ranks what mattered, which would favor Gaines? Scott claimed he outranked Gaines because Scott's brevet rank of major general, dated July 25, 1814, made him senior to Gaines, whose brevet was dated August 15, 1814. Gaines argued that he should be senior; his and Scott's promotions to brigadier general, colonel, and lieutenant colonel were all issued on the same dates, but Gaines had been promoted to major while Scott was still a captain. The dispute was important to both because they realized that assignment as the Army's commanding general might be at stake.  Scott served as president of the Army's Board of Tactics in 1815, and supervised the modernization of the Army's drill regulations. He also headed a postwar officer retention board in 1815, with post-war reductions in personnel strength the overriding concern. As a result of the board's recommendations, Jacob Brown was appointed as the Army's commander with the rank of major general; Scott and Gaines were retained as brigadier generals, and Brigadier General Alexander Macomb agreed to accept reduction in rank to colonel in order to serve as the Army's chief of engineers. Scott visited Europe to study French military methods in 1815 and 1816, and translated several of the manuals from Napoleon's Army into English. Scott held command of the Division of the North beginning in 1816. He served again as president of the Board of Tactics in 1821, 1824 and 1826, and again oversaw updating of the Army's field regulations. He began command of the Eastern Department in 1825.  Scott and Gaines were passed over for the commanding general's post in 1828, following the death of Jacob Brown. Aware of the Scott/Gaines rivalry, President John Quincy Adams nominated Macomb. Scott attempted to resign, but it was not accepted. Scott again visited Europe and then resumed command of the Eastern Department in 1829. In 1830, Scott published Abstract of Infantry Tactics, Including Exercises and Manueuvres of Light-Infantry and Riflemen, for the Use of the Militia of the United States.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Winfield Scott","rationale":"The given context describes the life of Winfield Scott.

Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed.

On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store.\\nJesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress.

Greater evidence of such a people is found on Mallorca and Menorca than on Ibiza, but one of the Balearics' most important sites is actually on the island of Formentera, where the megalithic monument/tomb of Ca Na Costa has been dated to 2000 b.c. Ibiza's key location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, such as the Phoenician traders, who called the island Ibosim. The Greeks dubbed it Ebysos, the Romans called it Ebusus, and the Moors, Yebisah. The Carthaginians: A detailed history of the island doesn't begin until it became a colony of Carthage in the 7th century b.c. . The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon, and from their bases in North Africa and what's now Spain, they challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region. Their interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which to this day remain the source of a profitable industry. They capitalized on the natural resources by using the salt to cure fish, which they exported to their home country. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining and continued to be of significance up until this century. It is believed that the lead pellets which were used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal were made on Ibiza. The Carthaginians also considered the island a holy place, and here in great splendour they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis on the Puig des Molins (Hill of the Windmills) below the Dalt Vila (Old Town) of Ibiza. Under the gnarled olive trees archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of statues, jewellery, pitchers, tools, and coins, which are now displayed in the town's two archaeological museums. The Romans never really infiltrated Ibiza, and even after the defeat of Hannibal in 202 b.c. during the Second Punic War their influence was restrained.

For coronaviruses, this critical step is governed by the virally-encoded spike (S) protein, a class I viral fusion protein that has several unique features. Coronavirus entry is unusual in that it is often biphasic in nature, and can occur at or near the cell surface or in late endosomes. Recent advances in structural, biochemical and molecular biology of the coronavirus S protein has shed light on the intricacies of coronavirus entry, in particular the molecular triggers of coronavirus S-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, characterization of the coronavirus fusion peptide (FP), the segment of the fusion protein that inserts to a target lipid bilayer during membrane fusion, has revealed its particular attributes which imparts some of the unusual properties of the S protein, such as Ca 2+ -dependency. These unusual characteristics can explain at least in part the biphasic nature of coronavirus entry. In this review, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as model virus, we give an overview of advances in research on the coronavirus fusion peptide with an emphasis on its role and properties within the biological context of host cell entry.","target":"Physiological and molecular triggers for SARS-CoV membrane fusion and entry into host cells","rationale":"The title should provide a good summary of the research presented in the paper.

As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter at a rate of ten percent every 1.1 billion years. In about 600 million years, the Sun brightness will have disrupted the Carbon Cycle to the point that trees and forests (C3 photosynthetic plant life) will no longer be able to survive and in around 800 million years, the Sun will have killed all complex life on the Earth's surface and in the oceans. In 1.1 billion years' time, the Sun's increased radiation output will cause its circumstellar habitable zone to move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life will be reduced to single celled organisms. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5 billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Would Rob see less or more complex organisms in gear B than in gear C?","target":"more","rationale":"In the hint, it mentions that in about 600 million years, trees and forests will no longer be able to survive.

The remainder of the Packers' drives in the first half were largely unsuccessful. On the first play of the second quarter, Aaron Rodgers pass was tipped and then intercepted by Derrick Brooks. The turnover set the Buccaneers up on the Packers 32-yard line. Shortly thereafter, Brian Griese connected to Alex Smith to tie the score at 7. Later in the second quarter, Green Bay faced 4th & 15 at their own 5-yard line. Derrick Frost punted from the back of the endzone, but the punt took a \\"Buccaneer bounce\\" and was downed at the Green Bay 41-yard line. The resulting good field position led to a Matt Bryant field goal, and a 10-7 lead. Earlier in the week, Bryant suffered tragedy off the field, with the death of his 3-month old son Tryson. Four plays later, Rodgers was intercepted again, this time by Barrett Ruud. Before the end of the second quarter, Bryant kicked another field goal, and the Buccaneers led 13-7 at halftime. Tampa Bay took the second half kickoff, and drove to the Packers 17-yard line. A play later, however, Griese's pass was bobbled by Michael Clayton at the 5, and intercepted by Tramon Williams. After trading possessions, midway through the third quarter, Green Bay was at their own 40-yard line. Ryan Grant fumbled, and Jermaine Phillips recovered for a 38-yard Buccaneer touchdown. On the second play of Tampa Bay's next drive, Griese threw his second interception, which was returned to the 42-yard line. Aaron Rodgers threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings to trim the score to 20-14. Rodgers, however, appeared to injure his throwing arm on the play. Early in the fourth quarter, Griese threw his second straight interception (and third overall), which was returned 62 yards by Charles Woodson for a touchdown. The Packers took a 21-20 lead with just under 14 minutes to go, while rookie back-up quarterback Matt Flynn took over for the next drive.

Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on \\"Gaddafi's Pet Project\\", the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces. Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with Libya, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a joint NFSL–Muslim Brotherhood militia, and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.\\n\\nNow answer this question: How much money did Libya earn from oil in 1986?","target":"$5.4 billion","rationale":"The paragraph mentions that Libya's oil revenue dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion between 1982 and 1986, which shows that the country earned around 5.4 million in 1986"},{"source":"To open a pickle jar when it is stuck.","target":"take a shirt and grip the lid when you twist.

Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or remembering to remember (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.;\\nAnswer: Time-based prospective memories;\\nQuestion:","target":"If a memory is triggered by a time, which kind of memory is this?","rationale":"The context provides the definition of Time-based prospective memory.

The amount of available space for airflow determines whether air acts as an insulator or conductor. The space between the inside and outside walls of a house, for example, is about 9 cm (3.5 in) —large enough for convection to work effectively. The addition of wall insulation prevents airflow, so heat loss (or gain) is decreased. Similarly, the gap between the two panes of a double-paned window is about 1 cm, which prevents convection and takes advantage of air’s low conductivity to prevent greater loss. Fur, fiber, and fiberglass also take advantage of the low conductivity of air by trapping it in spaces too small to support convection, as shown in the figure.

He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.\\nBach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos.

First, there were two touchdowns in the first half: 10-yard TD pass and 3-yard TD pass; therefore, these are our options for which one could be a second longest touchdown (STEP 2). Here comes the question \\"which one is longer?\\". To answer that question, let's check if they had any unit or not (STEP 3). Obviously yes!  Therefore we need convert both numbers into same units by dividing 10/3 = 1(1/3) <-- This means that 10 yards is longer than 3 yards.

Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum.\\n\\n- A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\\n\\n- In mathematics , a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements . For example , the sequence \\\\ langle A , B , D \\\\ rangle is a subsequence of \\\\ langle A , B , C , D , E , F \\\\ rangle obtained after removal of elements C , E , and F. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a preorder . The subsequence should not be confused with substring \\\\ langle A , B , C , D \\\\ rangle which can be derived from the above string \\\\ langle A , B , C , D , E , F \\\\ rangle by deleting substring \\\\ langle E , F \\\\ rangle . The substring is a refinement of the subsequence .\\n\\n- In mathematics, especially in order theory, a preorder or quasiorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive. Preorders are more general than equivalence relations and (non-strict) partial orders, both of which are special cases of a preorder.\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is at the same time a reflexive relation, a symmetric relation and a transitive relation. As a consequence of these properties an equivalence relation provides a partition of a set into equivalence classes.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed. Like a set, it contains members (also called \\"elements\\", or \\"terms\\"). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the \\"length\\" of the sequence. Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is either the set of the natural numbers (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first \\"n\\" natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length \\"n\\"). The position of an element in a sequence is its \\"rank\\" or \\"index\\"; it is the integer from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or of a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1. When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the \\"n\\"th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with \\"n\\" as subscript; for example, the \\"n\\"th element of the Fibonacci sequence is generally denoted \\"F\\".\\n\\n- In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in \\"there are \\"six\\" coins on the table\\") and ordering (as in \\"this is the \\"third\\" largest city in the country\\"). In common language, words used for counting are \\"cardinal numbers\\" and words used for ordering are \\"ordinal numbers\\".\\n\\n- Order theory is a branch of mathematics which investigates the intuitive notion of order using binary relations. It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as \\"this is less than that\\" or \\"this precedes that\\". This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions. A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the order theory glossary.\\n\\n- Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.\\n\\n- In mathematics, a binary relation on a set \\"A\\" is a collection of ordered pairs of elements of \\"A\\". In other words, it is a subset of the Cartesian product \\"A\\" = . More generally, a binary relation between two sets \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" is a subset of .

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\\n\\nPassage: While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes 'the principle of equality of its citizens' and is meant to be founded on 'representative democracy'. In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and 'qualified majorities' or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this 'democratic deficit' under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are 'degressively proportional' according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste 'Les Verts' v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power ('kratia') is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people ('demos'): in the EU it is not yet true that 'the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.'

Allodapine brood are highly vulnerable to predation because they are progressively reared in an open nest (not in sealed brood cells), which provides potentially large benefits for alloparental care and incentives for reproductives to tolerate potential alloparents.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause hearing loss and brain disorders in children and, in severe cases, can kill. Vaccination coverage needs to be around 95 percent to prevent the virus circulating in communities - so-called “herd immunity”. In many countries, anti-vaccine campaigners seek to dissuade parents from getting their children immunized, despite strong scientific evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. In Italy, the co-ruling anti-establishment Five Star Movement has questioned the safety of some vaccines and loudly denounced efforts to make vaccinations mandatory. In the WHO’s European region, which covers nearly 900 million people, some 82,600 in 47 countries contracted measles last year - the highest number this decade. Of those, 72 cases were fatal. Six of the 53 countries did not report. In 34 of the countries, estimated coverage with a second dose of measles vaccine was below 95 percent. “(Immunization) gaps at local level still offer an open door to the virus,” the WHO’s European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said in a statement. Professor Arne Akbar, president of the British Society for Immunology, said the figures were “extremely concerning”. Heidi Larson, a specialist in vaccines and public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the increase in cases was a “wake-up call on the importance of building confidence in vaccination”. A report published by the European Commission last year and compiled by a team led by Larson found that measles immunization coverage has fallen in 12 EU countries since 2010, and that seven out of the 10 countries with the lowest vaccine confidence in the world are in Europe.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states:\\n“Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.”\\nYet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...\\nQuestion: The strike will likely last\\nOptions:\\n\\nA. 1 year\\n\\nB. not enough information\\n\\nC. 2 weeks\\n\\nD. 6 months","target":"C","rationale":"The context mentions strike action and the dispute between employees of universities, represented by the UCU, against their employers.

Calcium dobesilate (DOBE) has been tested in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy showing a slowdown of the progression of the disease after long-term oral treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of DOBE on vascular and diabetic retinopathy in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats.', 'Diabetes was induced in wistar rats by the administration of STZ (60 mg/kg, i.p.). Rats were divided into three groups (n = 30). Group 0 (GO): nondiabetic rats. Group 1 (G1): 14 months of insulin treatment after diabetes development. Group 2 (G2): 14 months of insulin treatment after diabetes development plus DOBE (500 mg/kg/day). At the end of the treatment, vascular reactivity was tested. The study of the vascularization of the retina was performed on wholemounts of trypsin retinal digest preparations and retinal sections.', 'Relaxation induced by acetylcholine decreased in the aorta arteries from diabetic rats but it was restored to control values in the DOBE-treated group (71.8 +/- 4.5%, 53.3 +/- 0.5%, 67.4 +/- 4.6% in group 0, 1 and 2 respectively).

In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks.  He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack.  Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23.

Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \\"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \\"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \\"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body.

It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer Sir Charles Allom, created a more \\"binding\\" Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873.

It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton.

It included the 6th, 33rd, and the 121st Rifle Divisions at the beginning of the invasion on 17 September. By 2 October, these divisions had transferred to other units, and it included the 29th, 64th, and 145th Rifle Divisions instead. The corps headquarters relocated to Grodno in November and became part of the 11th Army. Between June and July 1940 it was briefly headquartered at Kovno before moving to Šiauliai in August, part of the Baltic Special Military District. The 11th transferred to the 8th Army in October, and included the 11th and 125th Rifle Divisions by the outbreak of the war. It defended a 40-kilometer sector on the left flank of the 8th Army, with its headquarters in the forests northwest of Skaudvilė.

The definition in this context of \\"hardstone\\" is unscientific and not very rigid, but excludes \\"soft\\" stones such as soapstone (steatite) and minerals such as alabaster, both widely used for carving, as well as typical stones for building and monumental sculpture, such as marble and other types of limestone, and sandstone. These are typically not capable of a fine finish in very small carvings, and would wear in prolonged use. In other contexts, such as architecture, \\"hard stone\\" and \\"soft stone\\" have different meanings, referring to actual measured hardness using the Mohs scale of mineral hardness and other measures. Some rocks used in architecture and monumental sculpture, such as granite, are at least as hard as the gemstones, and others such as malachite are relatively soft but counted as hardstones because of their rarity and fine colour.\\n Passage 3:Matheson was born on April 7, 1949 in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Jack and Peggy Matheson. Matheson had an intention to follow the footsteps of his father, Jack, a long-time sports editor for the Winnipeg Tribune. He graduated from the University of Manitoba with a degree in political science, and while in school, worked a part-time night shift with the Tribune. He got his first job upon completing school with the Regina Leader-Post, but moved west to Edmonton, Alberta six months later. Upon moving to Edmonton, Matheson got a job with the Edmonton Journal in 1970. He initially covered local curling and university sports, but quickly switched to hockey, when, in 1973, Edmonton was granted a WHA franchise, the Edmonton Oilers. Matheson became the beat writer for the Oilers then, and continued when the Oilers joined the NHL in 1979.

New evidence is usually used to improve earlier ideas rather than entirely replace them. In this way, scientists gradually refine their ideas and increase our understanding of the world. On the other hand, sometimes science advances in big leaps. This has happened when a scientist came up with a completely new way of looking at things. For example, Albert Einstein came up with a new view of gravity.

Both offenses were slow to start through the first quarter, though the Jets' defense capitalized when Giants running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled at his own 11-yard line, which was picked up by safety Kerry Rhodes for a touchdown. The Jets had a chance to extend the lead later in the period, but Mike Nugent missed a 42-yard field goal. The Giants responded on the ensuing drive with an eight-yard touchdown by Derrick Ward. The deadlock was broken toward the end of the first half when Chad Pennington led the Jets on a 93-yard drive with less than two minutes in the half, ending on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Brad Smith. The Jets were able to tack on a 47-yard field goal by Nugent to end the half, after they got the ball back on an interception of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by Jonathan Vilma, taking a 17-7 lead into the locker room. The Giants went to work when they opened the second half, getting a 19-yard touchdown run from Jacobs to cut the Jets' lead to three. The lead was restored back to ten, however, when Leon Washington returned the ensuing kickoff 98&#160;yards for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, Manning led the Giants downfield and completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey for a touchdown. Pennington attempted to respond by leading the Jets deep into Giants territory early in the fourth quarter, but he floated a pass toward the end zone which was intercepted at the two-yard line by cornerback Aaron Ross. Despite the bad field position, Manning eventually found Plaxico Burress on a 53-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants ahead, 28-24. The Jets tried to get back ahead later in the period, but Pennington was intercepted again by Ross (Pennington's third of the afternoon), who took it 43&#160;yards for what was effectively the game-sealing touchdown.
