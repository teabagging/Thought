The Buccaneers responded, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Connor Barth, then grabbed the lead at the end of the first quarter, with quarterback Josh Freeman connecting on an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark. After a scoreless second quarter, the Broncos re-claimed the lead for good with 21 unanswered points, consisting of two Manning touchdown passes to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas&#8212;from 8 and 10 yards, followed by linebacker Von Miller returning an interception off Freeman 26 yards for a touchdown. After a Manning interception late in the third quarter, a 50-yard field goal by Barth to begin the fourth quarter narrowed the gap to 28-13, but the Broncos countered with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater.

Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents the high level of interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had spent a good deal of time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, as well as that of Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.","target":"Charlotte","rationale":"\\"Etty was commissioned by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children.

The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in the anthology comic book \\"Amazing Fantasy\\" #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention, which he calls \\"web-shooters\\", and react to danger quickly with his \\"spider-sense\\", enabling him to combat his foes.\\n\\n- The Fantastic Four is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history. The symbol of Britannia was first used in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the Spanish  at the time, a rival kingdom much hated by the people of the land. In terms of the entire century, the historian John Guy (1988) argues that \\"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors\\" than at any time in a thousand years.\\n\\n- Sometimes referred to as scraperboard (especially in Great Britain), but usually called scratchboard in North America and Australia, is a form of direct engraving where the artist scratches off dark ink to reveal a white or colored layer beneath.

Cook came within about 120 km (75 mi) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773. The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals. According to various organizations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, and other sources), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820: von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut). The expedition led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny reached a point within 32 km (20 mi) from Queen Maud's Land and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 69°21′28″S 2°14′50″W\uFEFF / \uFEFF69.35778°S 2.24722°W\uFEFF / -69.35778; -2.24722, which became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. This happened three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. The first documented landing on Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis, apparently at Hughes Bay, near Cape Charles, in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim. The first recorded and confirmed landing was at Cape Adair in 1895.","target":"Antarctica","rationale":"The title of the article is \\"Antarctica\\".

Passage 1:A Winger and attacking midfielder, Jozefzoon began his career with spells at CTO '70 and AFC. He joined the Ajax Youth Academy in 2006 and signed a three-year professional contract in June 2008. Jozefzoon won his maiden call into the first team squad for the opening match of the 2010–11 Eredivisie season versus FC Groningen and remained an unused substitute during the 2–2 draw. He made his senior debut six days later, replacing Urby Emanuelson at half time during a 4–2 win over SBV Vitesse. He scored his only goal for the club in a 5–0 KNVB Becker third round win over MVV Maastricht on 22 September 2010. After five appearances during the 2010–11 season, Jozefzoon signed a one-year contract extension in June 2011, but spent the 2011–12 season away on loan and was released at the end of the season.\\n Passage 2:After easily dispatching the Utah Jazz in five games in the first round, the team started to look like a title contender, but in Game 2 against the Dallas Mavericks in the second round, their title hopes took a serious blow when star forward Chris Webber suffered a knee injury while trying to catch a lob pass from teammate Mike Bibby, ending his season. Webber's knee required microfracture surgery in the following off-season. Without their team captain and MVP, the Kings lost the series in seven games. Following the season, Hedo Türkoğlu was traded to the San Antonio Spurs, Scot Pollard was traded to the Indiana Pacers, Clark was dealt to the Utah Jazz, and Jackson signed as a free agent with the Houston Rockets.\\n Passage 3:In an early example of guerrilla filmmaking, Frankenheimer photographed Martin Balsam being ferried out to the supercarrier USS Kitty Hawk, berthed at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego (standing in for Gibraltar), without prior Defense Department permission. Frankenheimer needed a commanding figure to play Vice Admiral Farley C. Barnswell and asked his friend, well-known producer John Houseman to play him, to which he agreed, on condition that he have a fine bottle of wine (which is seen during the telephone scene), although he was uncredited for it. It was Houseman's American acting debut, and he would not appear onscreen again until his Oscar-winning role in The Paper Chase (1973). Frankenheimer also wanted a shot of Kirk Douglas entering the Pentagon, but could not get permission because of security considerations, so he rigged a movie camera in a parked station wagon to photograph Douglas walking up to the Pentagon. Douglas actually received salutes from military personnel inasmuch as he was wearing the uniform of a U.S. Marine Corps colonel. Several scenes, including one with nuns in the background, were shot inside Washington Dulles International Airport which had recently been built, and the production team were the first ever to film there. The alley and car park scene was shot in Hollywood, and other footage was shot in the Californian desert in 110 degree heat. The secret base and airstrip was specially built in the desert near Indio, California, and they borrowed an aircraft tail in one shot to make it look like a whole plane was off the picture.

In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly temperature, that effect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions. In particular, temperatures greater than 199 °C (390 °F), were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement.\\"\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"heated or diluted","rationale":"Asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing and other applications.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis.

In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference?

Brean Hammond focuses on Pope's singular achievement in making an independent living solely from his writing. Laura Brown (1985) adopts a Marxist approach and accuses Pope of being an apologist for the oppressive upper classes. Hammond (1986) has studied Pope's work from the perspectives of cultural materialism and new historicism. Along Hammond's lines, Raymond Williams explains art as a set of practices influenced by broad cultural factors rather than simply the vague ideas of genius alone. Hayden Carruth, wrote that it was \\"Pope's rationalism and pandeism with which he wrote the greatest mock-epic in English literature.\\" In Politics and Poetics of Transgression (1985) Peter Stallybrass and Allon White charge that Pope drew upon the low culture which he despised in order to produce his own \\"high art\\". They assert Pope was implicated in the very material he was attempting to exclude, not dissimilar to observations made in Pope's time.

Feminists have also criticised Pope's works. Ellen Pollak's The Poetics of Sexual Myth (1985) argues that Pope followed an anti-feminist tradition, that regarded women as inferior to men both intellectually and physically.

You can see an example in the Figure 1.1. In this example, nuclei of two hydrogen isotopes (tritium and deuterium) fuse to form a helium nucleus. A neutron and a tremendous amount of energy are also released. Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium occurs naturally in the sun and other stars. It takes place only at extremely high temperatures. Thats because a great deal of energy is needed to overcome the force of repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. The suns energy comes from fusion in its core, shown in the Figure 1.2. In the core, temperatures reach millions of degrees Kelvin. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: The Sun Q: Why doesnt nuclear fusion occur naturally on Earth? A: Nuclear fusion doesnt occur naturally on Earth because it requires temperatures far higher than Earth tempera- tures. Scientists are searching for ways to create controlled nuclear fusion reactions on Earth. Their goal is develop nuclear fusion power plants, where the energy from fusion of hydrogen nuclei can be converted to electricity. You can see how this might work in the Figure 1.3. In the thermonuclear reactor, radiation from fusion is used to heat water and produce steam. The steam can then be used to turn a turbine and generate electricity. The use of nuclear fusion for energy has several pros. Unlike nuclear fission, which involves dangerous radioactive elements, nuclear fusion involves just hydrogen and helium. These elements are harmless. Hydrogen is also very plentiful. There is a huge amount of hydrogen in ocean water. The hydrogen in just a gallon of water could produce as much energy by nuclear fusion as burning 1,140 liters (300 gallons) of gasoline! The hydrogen in the oceans would generate enough energy to supply all the worlds people for a very long time. Unfortunately, using energy from nuclear fusion is far from a reality. Scientists are a long way from developing the necessary technology. One problem is raising temperatures high enough for fusion to take place. Another problem is that matter this hot exists only in the plasma state. There are no known materials that can contain plasma, although a magnet might be able to do it. Thats because plasma consists of ions and responds to magnetism. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\\nThis isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom.

Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke.  On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear.  Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476.

The evaporation of water requires heat, which comes from solar radiation and warms up the oceans. When this warm air rises it cools off in contact with cold temperatures (often found near mountains or other geographical elements) causing condensation processes to occur; these process will then lead to cloud formation and precipitation like rain or snow)."},{"source":"Given the background: On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface.   The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).  Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.\\n\\nand the situation: Two continents were separated by a large ocean.

Her stage name was Lubov Roudenko, and she was also popularly known as \\"Spitfire Lu-Lu.\\" She had a can-can sequence in the 1938 ballet Gaîté Parisienne choreographed specially for her by Léonide Massine. She would later reprise this role in the 1941 Oscar-nominated short film The Gay Parisian. Whilst with the Ballet Russes, Rudenko was the subject of several drawings by Henri Matisse in 1939. Four of his portrait sketches of her are now in the Fogg Museum. Matisse also made a drawing of Rudenko in the ballet  Rouge et Noir. While on tour with the Ballet Russe, Rudenko performed the role of the Cowgirl in the 1942 ballet Rodeo until the tour reached New York and Agnes de Mille, the original choreographer, reclaimed the role for herself. Disappointed by this, Rudenko quit the Ballet Russes, and took a better-paid job performing in a Broadway production of The Merry Widow. This production launched at the Majestic Theatre on 4 August 1943, with Rudenko and James Starbuck leading the character dances, including a comic polka and a can-can number. After this, Rudenko played Grisette in Nellie Bly, a short-lived 1946 musical based on the life of Nellie Bly, and then became lead dancer for the 1946-49 Broadway production of Annie Get Your Gun, but following a knee injury, decided to pursue a career in fashion design.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership.

The ingredient list is short and simple--the first three ingredients are sugar, red raspberries, and jalape&ntilde;os.  There are no preservatives and no corn syrup, so this simple sauce lacks the added funky flavors and aftertastes that many other sauces have.The flavor of this sauce is so uncomplicated and good that I want to try other Fischer & Wieser sauces.  I've just subscribed to theirUltimate Sauce Gift Pack,a pack of six bottles including two bottles of Raspberry Chipotle.  I'm not a big fan of blueberry (ok, I admit I'm planning on giving that one away,) but the other sauces look promising. especially the Asian Apricot Stir Fry & Dipping Sauce.To try this sauce, I seasoned boneless pork ribs with rosemary and put them on the grill.  When they were done, I coated them with this sauce.  There was no need to cook the sauce, I just let it get to room temperature so it wouldn't cool the hot food.  The flavor was perfect with pork, but I can see that it will work well with chicken, and would be great on a salad, mixed with some rice wine vinegar or balsamic or cider vinegar.I've got to save what's left of this bottle, though, because friends will be visiting soon and I plan on drizzling this over cheese and crackers.  The included recipes suggest cream cheese, but I'll try it on brie and cheddar, too.4/5/09 UPDATE: I smothered a huge wedge of brie with this sauce and brought it to a party.

Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Two sister cities used petroleum products in different ways.

Passage 1:By the 1790s Braak was in the Caribbean, and was present at the defence against the French of Willemstad, part of the Dutch colony at Curaçao, in 1793. By late 1794 she was ordered to escort a convoy of East Indiamen to Batavia in the Netherlands East Indies. En route she called at the English port of Falmouth, unaware that the French had since invaded the Netherlands and proclaimed the Batavian Republic as a client state, compelling the Dutch to declare war on the British. On the arrival of the convoy at falmouth, the Royal Navy seized the 26 merchantmen and six warships of the convoy, including De Braak. A boarding party from the sloop-of-war took over De Braak. Forty-six Royal Navy vessels that were at Plymouth shared in the prize money.\\n Passage 2:In 2001 Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola was filed in the Florida Third District Court of Appeal, demanding a monetary compensation for $500 million for the deaths of three workers, members of the National Union for Food Industry Workers who worked in the Coca-Cola Bebidas y Alimentos plant in Carepa in northern Colombia. The lawsuit was brought by the Colombian trade union Sinaltrainal (National Union of Food Workers) and alleged that Panamco, a Colombian Coca-Cola bottling company, assisted paramilitaries in murdering several union members. Even though the alleged human rights violation occurred in Colombia, the union attempted to use the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) to bring the case into a U.S. district court. The ATCA grants U.S. courts jurisdiction in any dispute where it is alleged that a tort has been committed in violation of the \\"law of nations\\" or a treaty of the United States. The plaintiffs also alleged violations of the Torture Victims Protection Act (TVPA).\\n Passage 3:Fletcher was born at Auckland, New Zealand the son of the Rev Joseph Horner Fletcher, a Methodist clergyman, and his wife Kate, née Green. The family arrived in Australia early in 1861, and, after a term of four years in Queensland (where Joseph James studied at Ipswich Grammar School), Rev. Fletcher went to Sydney to become principal of Newington College, from 1865 to 1887. J. J. Fletcher completed his schooling at Newington (1865–1867) and then went to the University of Sydney and graduating BA in 1870 and MA in 1876. In between these years he was a master at Wesley College, Melbourne, under Professor M. H. Irving. As no science degree was offered in Australia, in 1876 resigned from Wesley and went to London, initially studying at the Royal School of Mines and University College, University of London where he studied biology and took his BSc degree there in 1879.

Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099.

These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A 3+3 design was used in this open-label, multicenter, phase I study and dose escalation/de-escalation applied until identification of the MTD. PF-04449913 was orally administered once daily in continuous 28-day treatment cycles. The starting dose was 80 mg.   \\n RESULTS A total of 23 patients were enrolled; 19 were evaluable for first-cycle dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The first-cycle DLT rate at the 640 mg dose level was 33.3%, and the MTD was estimated to be 320 mg once daily. The recommended phase II dose was not determined. PF-04449913 was generally well tolerated at doses of 80 to 320 mg once daily. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AE) were grade 1-2 dysgeusia, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, dizziness, dehydration, and diarrhea. Treatment-related grade 3 AEs only occurred in patients receiving PF-04449913 640 mg once daily. No treatment-related grade 4-5 AEs were reported. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated a generally dose-proportional kinetics with biphasic elimination, supporting once-daily dosing. PF-04449913 modulated hedgehog signaling at the dose levels tested, as demonstrated by >80% downregulation of GLI1 expression in the skin of treated patients. Eight patients (34.8%) achieved stable disease; none had complete or partial response.

It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which planet has more heat inside its atmosphere?","target":"planet B","rationale":"The background section mentions that the greenhouse effect is a major cause of global warming.

Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- Magnus Maximus (ca. 335  August 28, 388) was Western Roman Emperor from 383 to 388.\\n\\n- Flavius Eugenius (died 6 September 394) was a usurper in the Western Roman Empire (392394) against Emperor Theodosius I. Though himself a Christian, he was the last Emperor to support Roman polytheism.\\n\\n- Aelia Eudoxia (died 6 October 404) was the Empress consort of the Byzantine Emperor Arcadius.\\n\\n- Theodosius I (11 January 347  17 January 395), also known as Theodosius the Great, was Roman Emperor from AD 379 to AD 395. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire. On accepting his elevation, he campaigned against Goths and other barbarians who had invaded the empire. He failed to kill, expel, or entirely subjugate them, and after the Gothic War, they established a homeland south of the Danube, in Illyricum, within the empire's borders. He fought two destructive civil wars, in which he defeated the usurpers Magnus Maximus and Eugenius at great cost to the power of the empire.\\n\\n- Arcadius (1 January 377  1 May 408) was Eastern Roman Emperor from 383 to 408. He was the eldest son of Theodosius I and his first wife Aelia Flaccilla, and brother of the Western Emperor Honorius. A weak ruler, his reign was dominated by a series of powerful ministers and by his wife, Aelia Eudoxia.\\n\\n- The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".\\n\\n\\n\\n'rufinus ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'date of birth'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1\\n - 11\\n - 17\\n - 20\\n - 27\\n - 31\\n - 335\\n - 347\\n - 356\\n - 379\\n - 383\\n - 386\\n - 394\\n - 408\\n - 50\\n - 500\\n - 6","target":"335","rationale":"'rufinus ' is related to 335 object entity through the relation of 'date of birth'."},{"source":"Given an abstract, indicate which of the provided candidate titles (Option1 and Option2) best describes it (respond with the text of the title, not option1/2).\\n\\nAbstract: Mucoceles of the sphenoid sinus are rare. Only occasional reports have appeared in the medical literature since they were first described by Berg in 1889. The sphenoid sinus lies deep within the skull at the crossroads of 13 sensitive structures. The presence of a sphenoid sinus mucocele may be accompanied by a wide variety of signs and symptoms depending upon which of these structures are involved. The majority of these lesions are initially misdiagnosed as malignancies leading to increased patient morbidity and possible mismanagement.

The diagnosis was corrected only after surgical exploration of the sphenoid sinus revealed a mucocele. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Sphenoid sinus mucocele masquerading as a skull base malignancy. option2: Centrilobular lesions of the lung: demonstration by high-resolution CT and pathologic correlation.","target":"Sphenoid sinus mucocele masquerading as a skull base malignancy","rationale":"The abstract discusses two cases of sphenoid sinus mucoceles that presented with a variety of neurological signs and symptoms.

After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal. Heading into their bye week, the Patriots improved to 7-1, the best record in the league.\\nHow many yards difference was there in Bradys touchdown pass to Amendola compared to Hogan?","target":"24","rationale":"To calculate how many yards difference was there in Bradys touchdown pass to Amendola compared to Hogan, you need to check the distance of each passing. First Brady passed 9-yard when Patriots scored 7 points as a result. Second he passed 53 yard after two penalties on Bills and this led Patriots 14-3 score.

It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other.

Rundgren was originally concerned that they had taken \\"the worst sounding studio in the city at that time\\" because it was the only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: \\"The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate.\\" New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of $17,000 (equivalent to $96,000 in 2018). With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, \\"we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn't like these people who conceptualize things.

In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country.

POST : My biological father and I lost contact about 3 years ago after a string of arguments about how he was never there for me when I needed him.\\n\\nRewind to my childhood, my mum was basically a single parent to my older brother and I because he was never there for us.

In 1982, he led Italy to the 1982 FIFA World Cup title, scoring six goals to win the Golden Boot as top goalscorer, and the Golden Ball for the player of the tournament. Rossi is one of only three players to have won all three awards at a World Cup, along with Garrincha in 1962, and Mario Kempes in 1978. Rossi was also awarded the 1982 Ballon d'Or as the European Footballer of the Year for his performances.\\nContext: Despite his ban, Rossi was purchased back by Juventus in 1981, and he returned to the starting line-up just in time for the end of the 1981-82 season to contribute to the club's 1981-82 Serie A title (scoring 1 goal in 3 appearances), and to take part in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, with Italy. Italian journalists and tifosi initially lamented that he was in very poor shape, however, and this view seemed to be confirmed by Italy's appalling performance in the three group matches, in which he was allegedly described as a \\"ghost aimlessly wandering over the field\\".  Italy manager Enzo Bearzot, however, staunchly confirmed Rossi for the decisive round robin in the second round, in which his team was to face Argentina, the reigning World Champions, and Brazil, the biggest favourites to win the title, with a team consisting of world-class players such as Socrates, Zico, and Falcao. After Italy defeated Argentina 2-1, also thanks to the defensive work of Claudio Gentile and Gaetano Scirea, who shut down the young Argentinean star Diego Maradona, Rossi scored three memorable goals to defeat Brazil 3-2 to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-final match against Poland, Rossi's two goals won the match for Italy once again, granting them a place in the 1982 World Cup final. In the final against West Germany, Rossi scored the first of Italy's three goals, off of an indirect set-piece assist from Gentile, helping Italy to win the match 3-1, giving his team their third World Cup title. With six goals in total, he won the tournament's maximo goleador award -- the Golden Boot -- as the top scorer of the tournament, as well as the Golden Ball Award for the best player of the tournament, and he was named as part of the team of the tournament for the second consecutive time.  Italian fans hung banners proclaiming him \\"Man of the match\\". Rossi's accomplishments in Spain gained him the title of European Footballer of the Year and World Player of the Year in 1982, as well as the 1982 Onze d'Or Award.

Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal.

Work in the mouse demonstrated transmission of commensal bacteria from mother to fetus during gestation, though it is unclear what modulates this process. We have previously shown in the nonhuman primate that, independent of obesity, a maternal high-fat diet during gestation and lactation persistently shapes the juvenile gut microbiome. We therefore sought to interrogate in a population-based human longitudinal cohort whether a maternal high-fat diet similarly alters the neonatal and infant gut microbiome in early life.', 'A representative cohort was prospectively enrolled either in the early third trimester or intrapartum (n\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009163), with a subset consented to longitudinal sampling through the postpartum interval (n\\\\u2009=\\\\u200981). Multiple body site samples, including stool and meconium, were collected from neonates at delivery and by 6\\\\xa0weeks of age. A rapid dietary questionnaire was administered to estimate intake of fat, added sugars, and fiber over the past month (National Health and Examination Survey). DNA was extracted from each infant meconium/stool sample (MoBio) and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis.', \\"On average, the maternal dietary intake of fat ranged from 14.0 to 55.2\\\\xa0%, with an average intake of 33.1\\\\xa0% (σ\\\\u2009=\\\\u20096.1\\\\xa0%).

Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the microbiome of the neonatal stool at birth (meconium) clustered differently by virtue of maternal gestational diet (PERMANOVA p\\\\u2009=\\\\u20090.001). LEfSe feature selection identified several taxa that discriminated the groups, with a notable relative depletion of Bacteroides in the neonates exposed to a maternal high-fat gestational diet (Student's t-test, p\\\\u2009<\\\\u20090.05) that persisted to 6\\\\xa0weeks of age.","target":"Does the early infant gut microbiome vary in association with a maternal high-fat diet?","rationale":"The given passage is about maternal diet and its effects on the infant gut microbiome.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls at the conclusion of the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Following his sudden death from cancer in 1970, The NFL Super Bowl trophy was named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.\\n\\nIn the fall of 1934 Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor introduced him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz. When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father didn't like the idea of his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, a prejudice he would face more than once in his life. Lombardi and Marie wed, nonetheless, on August 31, 1940.  \\"He seemed preoccupied with football even on their honeymoon, and cut it short to get back to Englewood ... 'I wasn't married to him more than one week', she later related, 'when I said to myself, Marie Planitz, you've made the greatest mistake of your life.'\\"  Marie's first pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage. This had a terrible effect on Marie and caused her to turn to heavy drinking, a problem she would deal with on more than one occasion in her life. Their son, Vincent Harold Lombardi (Vince Jr.), was born in 1942,  and their daughter Susan followed five years later in 1947.  Lombardi's perfectionism, authoritarian nature and temper, instilled in his wife a masterful ability to verbally assault and demean Lombardi when he verbally abused her. His children were not immune from his yelling. When Lombardi had not lost his temper, he would often be reticent and aloof.  Lombardi's grandson, Joe Lombardi, was named the offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions in January 2014. He was relieved of this position midway through the 2015 season. Lombardi was previously quarterbacks coach for the New Orleans Saints. In the 2009 season, he helped lead the Saints to win the trophy bearing his grandfather's name and Drew Brees to win a Super Bowl MVP award.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what did his father do","target":"Italian butcher","rationale":"The first paragraph states that Lombardi was the son of Italian butcher.\\nTherefore, in answer to the question \\"what did his father do\\", we can give \\"Italian butcher\\" as an option."},{"source":"Read the following context and answer the question.\\nContext: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio):\\nAs this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio.\\nThroughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”.\\nConstraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...\\nQuestion: The writer believes that\\nAnswer:","target":"Changing environment can inspire thought","rationale":"The author is discussing the effects of constraints on creativity.

Like many membrane proteins, corin is shed from the cell surface.   \\n METHODS AND RESULTS In this study, we obtained plasma samples from healthy controls and patients with heart failure (HF) and acute myocardial infarction. Soluble corin levels in plasma were measured by an ELISA method. In healthy adults (n=198), plasma corin levels were 690 pg/mL (SD, 260 pg/mL). The corin levels did not differ significantly among different age groups. In patients with HF (n=291), plasma corin levels were significantly lower compared with that of healthy controls (365 pg/mL [SD, 259]; P<0.001). The reduction in plasma corin levels seemed to correlate with the severity of HF. In patients of New York Heart Association classes II, III, and IV, plasma corin levels were 450 pg/mL (SD, 281 pg/mL; n=69), 377 pg/mL (SD, 270 pg/mL; n=132), and 282 pg/mL (SD, 194 pg/mL; n=90), respectively (P<0.001 class II vs class IV; P<0.05 class III vs class IV). In contrast, plasma corin levels in patients with acute myocardial infarction (n=73) were similar to that of healthy controls (678 pg/mL [SD, 285 pg/mL]; P>0.05).   \\n CONCLUSIONS Soluble corin was detected in human plasma. Plasma corin levels were reduced significantly in patients with HF but not in those with acute myocardial infarction.

Maslow was a psychology professor at Alliant International University, Brandeis University, Brooklyn College, New School for Social Research, and Columbia University. He stressed the importance of focusing on the positive qualities in people, as opposed to treating them as a \\"bag of symptoms.\\" A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Maslow as the tenth most cited psychologist of the 20th century.\\n\\nMaslow's thinking was original. Most psychologists before him had been concerned with the abnormal and the ill. He urged people to acknowledge their basic needs before addressing higher needs and ultimately self-actualization. He wanted to know what constituted positive mental health. Humanistic psychology gave rise to several different therapies, all guided by the idea that people possess the inner resources for growth and healing and that the point of therapy is to help remove obstacles to individuals' achieving them. The most famous of these was client-centered therapy developed by Carl Rogers.  The basic principles behind humanistic psychology are simple: 1. Someone's present functioning is their most significant aspect. As a result, humanists emphasize the here and now instead of examining the past or attempting to predict the future. 2. To be mentally healthy, individuals must take personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of whether the actions are positive or negative. 3. Each person, simply by being, is inherently worthy. While any given action may be negative, these actions do not cancel out the value of a person. 4. The ultimate goal of living is to attain personal growth and understanding. Only through constant self-improvement and self-understanding can an individual ever be truly happy.  Humanistic psychology theory suits people who see the positive side of humanity and believe in free will. This theory clearly contrasts with Freud's theory of biological determinism. Another significant strength is that humanistic psychology theory is compatible with other schools of thought. Maslow's Hierarchy is also applicable to other topics, such as finance, economics, or even in history or criminology. Humanist psychology, also coined positive psychology, is criticized for its lack of empirical validation and therefore its lack of usefulness in treating specific problems. It may also fail to help or diagnose people who have severe mental disorders.

The effect of cisapride on gastric emptying of solids was studied in 9 diabetic patients, all of whom had delayed gastric emptying of indigestible solids (gastroparesis). Six patients had chronic nausea and vomiting, and 3 had no symptoms. Cisapride (5 mg) was given intravenously 15 min before ingestion of a 400-kcal test meal and 10 indigestible solid radiopaque markers. On separate days and in random order each patient also received intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) or placebo 15 min before ingestion of the meal and markers. Mean gastric emptying of radiopaque markers, assessed by serial radiographs of the gastric region, was accelerated by metoclopramide and cisapride, but the difference reached significance only with cisapride (p less than 0.05). There was considerable intersubject variability in gastric emptying responses to cisapride and metoclopramide. No side effects occurred with either drug.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.”\\nLarisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

Following the opening kickoff, Brady put together a 14-play 60-yard drive. The Patriots drove to the Saints 12, but on 3rd-and-7 Tom Brady was sacked for a 5-yard loss forcing them to settle for Stephen Gostkowski's 35-yard field goal to take the opening lead 3-0. The Saints went 3-and-out on their opening drive and the Patriots followed that with a 3-and-out of their own. The Saints responded by marching 73 yards taking over five minutes off the clock  with Drew Brees tossing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Travaris Cadet. The Patriots immediately responded by slowly moving 80 yards to take a 10-7 lead on Stevan Ridley's 1-yard touchdown run. The Saints went 3-and-out yet again on their next drive and the Patriots took advantage with a long drive taking up 4:52 seconds in 12 plays as they marched 69 yards to increase their lead to 17-7 on another Stevan Ridley touchdown run, this one from 4 yards out. Punts filled the&#160;!of the half and the Patriots led 17-7 at halftime. The Saints took the opening kickoff of the second half 70 yards to the Patriots 10, but the Patriots kept them out of the end zone and Garrett Hartley kicked a 28-yard field goal to trim the lead 17-10. After a Patriots 3-and-out, the Saints stormed 67 yards with Khiry Robinson rushing for a 3-yard touchdown to suddenly tie the game at 17. The Patriots managed to respond on the follow-up drive marching 54 yards in 12 plays, but settled for Gostkowski's 54-yard field goal to retake the lead 20-17. Early in the fourth quarter on 3rd-and-12, the Drew Brees called a timeout to avoid delay of game, but the referees didn't see it so Brees was forced to snap the ball. Brees forced a pass intended for Jimmy Graham, but was by Kyle Arrington at the Saints 25 and returned for 5 yards to the Saints 20. The Patriots managed to reach the Saints 5-yard line, but were kept out of the end zone and Gostkowski kicked a 23-yard field goal to increase th Patriots lead to 23-17. The Saints immediately responded by storming 81 yards in 5:05 with Brees connecting with Kenny Stills on a 34-yard touchdown pass on 3rd-and-20, giving the Saints their second lead of the night 24-23. Four straight incompletions from Brady on the next drive seemingly ended the game, but the Patriots held the Saints to only three yards and Hartley kicked a 39-yard field goal to increase the lead to 27-23. Brady threw a seemingly game deciding interception with just 2:16 remaining but once again, the Patriots defense managed to hold the Saints to a 3-and-out (mostly due to the Saints erratic play calling). Brady got the ball back at his own 30 with 1:13 remaining and no timeouts, and mounted his 39th career game-winning drive. Tom Brady hit Edelman for 23 yards on the first play to move the ball to the Saints 47. He then completed passes to Austin Collie for 15 yards and Aaron Dobson for 6 yards moving the ball to the Saints 26-yard line with 0:35 seconds left. Back-to-back incompletions set up a 4th-and-4. Brady completed a pass to Collie again for 9 yards. Brady spiked the ball at the 17 with&#160;:10 seconds remaining. On the very next play, Brady connected with Thompkins for a 7-yard touchdown pass with five seconds remaining on the clock giving the Patriots the 30-27 lead. The Saints attempted a hook-and-lateral on the kickoff, but Darren Sproles fumbled and Jamie Collins recovered to end the game. The win (his 28th comeback win and 40th game-winning 4th quarter drive) was also his first in four tries against a Drew Brees-quarterbacked team.

In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or (read \\"common time\\" and \\"three-four time\\", respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter.\\n\\n- Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music. With his ever-changing directions in music, Davis was at the forefront of a number of major stylistic developments in jazz over his five-decade career.\\n\\n- David Warren \\"Dave\\" Brubeck (December 6, 1920  December 5, 2012) was an American jazz pianist and composer, considered to be one of the foremost exponents of cool jazz. He wrote a number of jazz standards, including \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\" and \\"The Duke\\". Brubeck's style ranged from refined to bombastic, reflecting his mother's attempts at classical training and his improvisational skills. His music is known for employing unusual time signatures, and superimposing contrasting rhythms, meters, and tonalities.\\n\\n- Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records.\\n\\n- Time Further Out is a 1961 release by the Dave Brubeck Quartet . It features the \`\` Classic Quartet '' : pianist Dave Brubeck , alto saxophonist Paul Desmond , bassist Eugene Wright , and drummer Joe Morello . The album was recorded by engineer Fred Plaut and produced by Teo Macero .\\n\\n- Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.\\n\\n- Cool jazz is a style of modern jazz music that arose in the United States after World War II. It is characterized by relaxed tempos and lighter tone, in contrast to the tense and complex bebop style. Cool jazz often employs formal arrangements and incorporates elements of classical music. Broadly, the genre refers to a number of post-war jazz styles employing a more subdued approach than that found in other contemporaneous jazz idioms. As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggest \\"the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to pastel colors, while the solos of [Dizzy] Gillespie and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors.\\"\\n\\n- Bitches Brew is a studio double album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, released on March 30, 1970, on Columbia Records. The album continued his experimentation with electric instruments previously featured on his critically acclaimed \\"In a Silent Way\\" album. With the use of these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of a looser, rock-influenced improvisational style.\\n\\n- A bassist, or bass player, is a musician who plays a bass instrument such as a double bass, bass guitar, keyboard bass or a low brass instrument such as a tuba or sousaphone. Different musical genres tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&B, soul music, rock and roll, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop music. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands.\\n\\n- A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).\\n\\n- Frederick \\"Fred\\" Plaut (1907-1985) was a recording engineer and amateur photographer. He was employed by Columbia Records in the US during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, eventually becoming the label's chief engineer. Plaut engineered sessions for what would result in many of Columbia's famous albums, including the original cast recordings of \\"South Pacific\\", \\"My Fair Lady\\", and \\"West Side Story\\", jazz LPs \\"Kind of Blue\\" and \\"Sketches of Spain\\" by Miles Davis, \\"Time Out\\" by Dave Brubeck, \\"Mingus Ah Um\\" and \\"Mingus Dynasty\\" by Charles Mingus.\\n\\n- Mingus Dynasty is a jazz album by Charles Mingus, recorded in 1959 for Columbia Records. It is the companion album to his other 1959 record \\"Mingus Ah Um\\" and was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. The album title references the Ming Dynasty and harkens to Mingus' Chinese ancestry. Tracks 1, 3, 4 and 5 would be originally released in their incomplete form, otherwise they wouldn't fit into a single LP. They were first released in their unedited form only in 1979 on vinyl, and in 1999 on CD. The cuts amount to about 8 minutes.\\n\\n- \\"Take Five\\" is a jazz piece composed by Paul Desmond and originally recorded by the Dave Brubeck Quartet for its 1959 album \\"Time Out\\". Made at Columbia Records' 30th Street Studio in New York City on July 1, 1959, two years later it became an unlikely hit and the biggest-selling jazz single ever. Appearing since on numerous movie and television soundtracks, today it still receives significant radio play. \\"Take Five\\" was for several years during the early 1960s the theme music for the NBC \\"Today\\" TV program, the opening bars being played half a dozen times or more each day.\\n\\n- \\"Blue Rondo à la Turk\\" is a jazz standard composition by Dave Brubeck. It appeared on the album \\"Time Out\\" in 1959. It is written in time, with one side theme in , and the choice of rhythm was inspired by the Turkish aksak time signatures. It was originally recorded by the Dave Brubeck Quartet with Dave Brubeck at piano, Paul Desmond at alto saxophone, Eugene Wright at bass, and Joe Morello at drums. \\n\\n- Charlie Mingus (April 22, 1922  January 5, 1979) was an American jazz double bassist, composer and bandleader. His compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of hard bop, drawing heavily from black gospel music and blues, while sometimes containing elements of Third Stream, free jazz, and classical music. He once cited Duke Ellington and church as his main influences.\\n\\n- The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.\\n\\n- A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material.\\n\\n- Mingus Ah Um is a studio album by American jazz musician Charles Mingus, released in 1959 by Columbia Records.

Neil Fujita.\\n\\n- A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. \\n\\n- A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. \\n\\n- Jazz standards are musical compositions which are an important part of the musical repertoire of jazz musicians, in that they are widely known, performed, and recorded by jazz musicians, and widely known by listeners. There is no definitive list of jazz standards, and the list of songs deemed to be standards changes over time. Songs included in major fake book publications (sheet music collections of popular tunes) and jazz reference works offer a rough guide to which songs are considered standards.\\n\\n- Paul Desmond (born Paul Emil Breitenfeld; November 25, 1924  May 30, 1977) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and composer, best known for the work he did in the Dave Brubeck Quartet and for composing that group's greatest hit, \\"Take Five\\". He was one of the most popular musicians to come out of the West Coast's cool jazz scene.\\n\\n- Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".\\n\\n- Kind of Blue is a studio album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, released on August 17, 1959, by Columbia Records. It was recorded earlier that year on March 2 and April 22 at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York City. The recording sessions featured Davis's ensemble sextet, consisting of pianist Bill Evans, drummer Jimmy Cobb, bassist Paul Chambers, and saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley, together with pianist Wynton Kelly on one track.\\n\\n- MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.\\n\\n- Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.\\n\\n- Joseph Albert \\"Joe\\" Morello (July 17, 1928  March 12, 2011) was a jazz drummer best known for his work with The Dave Brubeck Quartet. He was frequently noted for playing in the unusual time signatures employed by that group in such pieces as \\"Take Five\\" and \\"Blue Rondo à la Turk\\". Popular for its work on college campuses during the 1950s, Brubeck's group reached new heights with Morello. In June 1959, Morello participated in a recording session with the quartet  completed by the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond and the bassist Eugene Wright  that yielded \\"Kathy's Waltz\\" and \\"Three to Get Ready,\\" both of which intermingled 3/4 and 4/4 time signatures.\\n\\n- Attilio Joseph \\"Teo\\" Macero (October 30, 1925  February 19, 2008) was an American jazz saxophonist, composer, and record producer. He was a producer at Columbia Records for twenty years, and most notably produced \\"Kind of Blue\\", the Miles Davis album which at No. 12 is the highest-ranked jazz album on \\"Rolling Stone's\\" 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and according to the RIAA is the best-selling jazz album of all time. Macero also produced Davis' \\"Bitches Brew\\", and Dave Brubeck's \\"Time Out\\", which, along with \\"Kind of Blue\\", are three of the best-selling and most influential jazz albums of all time.\\n\\n- Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'time further out' has the relation 'genre' with?","target":"cool jazz","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"cool jazz\\"."},{"source":"Given the fact that:\\n\\nBases have pH values above 7.

Dust exposure was estimated by personal and area sampling for total dust during a work shift and cumulative exposure by duration of employment. Seven percent of the workers had an elevated RAST, and 20% had nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Elevation in RAST was associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Almost half (46%) of the workers with RAST elevation had bronchial hyperresponsiveness compared to 18% in workers with no RAST elevation. The association was unaffected by total IgE level or by limiting the analysis to workers without respiratory symptoms and was most apparent in younger workers. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as with lower levels of pulmonary function. The likelihood of bronchial hyperresponsiveness increased with increasing age but was unrelated to the dust-exposure concentration. RAST elevation was unrelated to employment duration or dust exposure and was not associated with an increased prevalence of symptoms or lower levels of pulmonary function independent of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We conclude that plicatic acid-specific IgE and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness are associated in western red-cedar workers and that this association may reflect a causal connection. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes a number of numerical values. For example, it includes the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and elevation in RAST (i.e., 7% and 20%, respectively), as well as the percentage of workers with bronchial hyperresponsiveness who had RAST elevation (i.e., 46%). The abstract also reports the results of statistical analyses, including increases in bronchial hyperresponsiveness with increasing age and decreases in pulmonary function with higher levels of dust exposure concentration.

Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism.

Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left.

Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became...\\n\\nQuestion: What were the initial plans of the plane attack masterminds, before switching plans?\\nI think \\"KSM\\" is a valid answer.

The answer can be found in paragraph 2, which mentions that Bin Laden, Atef and KSM \\"contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute\\" (meaning carry out) the planes operation. This means they had planned on carrying it out themselves but later changed their minds when they learned about Atta's group from Germany who spoke fluent English. The passage does not mention anything about KSM being one of those involved with coming up with this original idea so we should not include him as part of our answer here since he did not have any involvement until after the new plan was set into motion.

Passage:In 1985, he founded his own recording studio—the wonder station. Their collaboration has invited comparisons to the collaborations of Steven Spielberg and John Williams. This big break led to Hisaishi's overwhelming success as a composer of film scores. In 1986, , would be the first feature to appear under the Studio Ghibli banner, and its gentle, faintly melancholic tone would become a familiar trademark of much of the studio's later output. And later, in the 1990s, Porco Rosso and Princess Mononoke were released. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding anime industry's top musical contributors, his compositions (including eight theatrical films and one OAV) would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the 1980s and 1990s. Hisaishi also composed for such TV and movie hits as Sasuga no Sarutobi, Two Down Full Base, Tonde Mon Pe and the anime Tekuno porisu 21C (all 1982), Sasuraiger (1983), Futari Taka (1984), (1985) and Oz no mahôtsukai (1986). He also scored the sci-fi adventure series Mospeada (1983), which was later reworked (without his music) into the third segment of Carl Macek's compilation, Robotech. Other films he scored included Mobile Suit Gundam Movie II: Soldiers of Sorrow (1981), Mobile Suit Gundam Movie III: Encounters in Space, (1982), Birth (Bâsu) (1984), Arion (1986), Robot Carnival (1987), Totoro (1988), Crest of the Royal Family and Maison Ikkoku – Apartment Fantasy (both 1988), Venus Wars (1989), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), Porco Rosso (1992) and Ocean Heaven (2010). He also did theme song arrangements and composed other anime opening, closing, and insert title theme songs such as Mahō Shōjo Lalabel (1980), Hello! Sandybell (1981), Meiken Jolie (1981), Voltron (1981), Ai Shite Knight (1983), Creamy Mami, the Magic Angel: Curtain Call (1986), and  (1988).\\n Links: a. Mobile Suit Gundam b.

Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as laid out in the Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced that democracy was the form of government mandated by God.The colony offered nearly all adult males potential citizenship. Full citizens, or \\"freemen\\", were accorded full rights and privileges in areas such as voting and holding office. To be considered a freeman, adult males had to be sponsored by an existing freeman and accepted by the General Court. Later restrictions established a one-year waiting period between nominating and granting of freeman status, and also placed religious restrictions on the colony's citizens, specifically preventing Quakers from becoming freemen. Freeman status was also restricted by age; the official minimum age was 21, although in practice most men were elevated to freeman status between the ages of 25 and 40, averaging somewhere in their early thirties. The colony established a disabled veterans' fund in 1636 to support veterans who returned from service with disabilities.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.","target":"group B","rationale":"The theory of evolution is based on the idea that life forms change over time and adapt to their environment.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.\\n\\n- Startin' with Me is the debut album of country music artist Jake Owen, released in July 2006 (see 2006 in country music) on RCA Records Nashville.

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said.

Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E.

Reluctantly, by following the imperial diet, most of the states of the empire joined Austria's cause. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states (especially Hanover). Sweden, fearing Prussia's expansionist tendencies, went to war in 1757 to protect its Baltic dominions, seeing its chance when virtually all of Europe opposed Prussia. Spain, bound by the Pacte de Famille, intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an utterly unsuccessful invasion of Portugal in 1762.

He's very flamboyant and metrosexual, we bonded quite easily and I made the mistake of saying that I thought we might have been best friends in another life. It's not long before he mentions his GF, Lana (F 28)... now things start getting a little weird. Pablo tells me that right before him and Lana started dating he had been in a very serious relationship that was heading towards marriage, when the girl suddenly ghosted him with no explanation whatsoever.  He goes on to tell me that even though he is 100% committed to Lana, he's not over what happened and he just hasn't really been giving it 100% (yikes, but I decide not to judge him because I've had my heart broken too and know what it feels like to be trying to move on)...\\n\\nSoon Pablo invites me to hang out with him and Lana. We link up for happy hour, I meet her and she is really sweet and wonderful. I like her a lot.  Now Pablo and Lana start inviting me out more and more as well as paying for me (even though I wanted to paying for myself), first it was weekly then progressively more and more... I have a really busy schedule and pretty full life, so I'm just not available that much and can't hang out as much as they would like to.... I'm actually relieved when the holidays come because they finally let up on asking me to hang out as much.\\n\\nNow during this time I actually think things are getting better and our friendship is balancing out... WRONG! Pablo messages me and tells me to go to the \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* (expensive clothing brand) website and pick out my Christmas gift, anything I want! This makes me feel a little uncomfortable because me and my friends don't spend that much money on each other during the holidays and I usually do home made gifts, so I pick out something very modest. We meet up before Christmas to exchange gifts (I made them a thoughtful couples gift) and everything seems pretty good... Then a few days later he sends me a picture of a second gift he has gotten me.... Okay, what? WHY??????\\n\\nNow I'm asking myself if Lana knows about this? Pablo gives me the impression that she does know because he bought her the same gift as me plus more.  So I start asking if I'm just not used to someone being so generous towards me and if I'm making this into something it's not???\\n\\nI decide to ignore my gut feeling and not get all weirded out by it. (I've never been comfortable accepting gifts from men because in my experience they take it to mean I want something more.)\\n\\nJump forward to about a week ago. I'm in for another hair cut and  Pablo brings up the gift thing... he goes on about how he usually spends so much more money on his friends, and that my gifts were so cheap that's why he bought me two... okay? Then while I'm getting my hair washed Pablo says \\"Do you know what I like about your body? I love how curvy your hips are and that you're not fat.\\"  I just feel like this is too \\"friendly\\"....\\n\\nI should also take this time to say that I am in no way sexually attracted to Pablo. I think he has a really cool personality and we get along really well as friends, except that I think he wants to hang out too often and is too friendly sometimes.\\n\\nNow I start confiding in my best friend and she says that is completely inappropriate and disrespectful to his GF.  I agree and decide its best decide to talk to his GF about it next time I see her. So, the next day Pablo invites me to hang out with him and Lana, I agree. We end up going to a concert a day later and there's just no good time to talk to her... Plus I ate something that wrecked my stomach. I was in so much pain by the end, I told them I needed to go home and didn't feel well. They said that they were going to go hot tubing and that if I felt better I should join them. I told them the chances of that were basically non existent. I go home, take some tums and crawl into bed. as soon as I'm snuggled under the covers I get 3 texts.... 2 from her and 1 from him... both basically saying \\"we're at the hot tub, when are you coming over?\\"\\n\\nNow at this point, I'm getting really annoyed. I reply back \\"My stomach is wrecked so I'm taking some tums and going to bed.\\" Lana replies to \\"Feel better\\" and Pablo replies \\"Damn! You still look good though!  Coming back out tonight?\\" I didn't reply and I put both of their numbers on do not disturb mode. (also no this is not a group text, they both message me separately... her not so much, but him like everyday.)\\n\\nI'm also starting to realize that Pablo has my schedule memorized. He messages me the next day \\"Good morning!\\"\\n\\n\\"Morning.\\" - Me\\n\\n\\"Going to the gym today?\\"-Pablo\\n\\n\\\\-\\\\_- (my face) \\"I'm here now.\\" - me\\n\\n\\"damn!

There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \\"Hook her up,\\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond.

Passage:Engle will be known forever as the man who hit the ball that Fred Snodgrass missed in the eight and final game of the 1912 World Series. The Series lasted eight games, due to a 6–6 tie in Game 2 when the game was called by darkness after 11 innings. Engle had appeared twice before during the Series in pinch-hitting duties. In Game 6, he hit a two-run RBI double off Giants pitcher Rube Marquard that scored Boston's only runs in a 5–2 losing effort. The decisive Game 8 at Fenway Park faced Joe Wood for Boston and Christy Mathewson for the New York Giants, who had broken a 1–1 tie by scoring a run in the first half of the 10th inning. The Red Sox started its half and manager Jake Stahl sent Engle to pinch-hit for pitcher Wood. Then, he hit a fly ball off Mathewson that came toward CF Snodgrass, who dropped the ball. Snodgrass made a fine catch on the next batter, Harry Hooper, but Mathewson walked Steve Yerkes, gave a single to Tris Speaker, and Engle went on to score the tying run. Another walk to Duffy Lewis and a sacrifice fly by Larry Gardner scored Yerkes with the winning run to give Boston the game and the series.","target":"b","rationale":"The passage only provides information about the game, not about any players.

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money....\\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\\nQuestion: When did the author became aware of Gilbert's plan?\\nOptions:\\n- After the client revealed the information\\n- Before the designers were hired\\n- not enough information\\n- Before the client revealed the information","target":"After the client revealed the information","rationale":"In the question, it is stated that IBM hired over 1000 designers and trained its managers in design thinking.

This shows that the information about Gilbert's plan came after his client revealed some details of how IBM has transformed itself by hiring these many designers and training them with modern technology such as cloud-based apps etc.,\\nSo, according to our reasoning we can conclude that when did the author became aware of Gilbert's plan?

In addition, the influence of age on morphometric dimensions and the soft tissue cover was tested. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that nasal height and nasal length are best predicted by the dimensions of the skull, whereas nasal depth and the thickness of the soft tissues is greatly influenced by age. In males, over 50% of the variance of nasal height and nasal length were accounted for by the height of the bony nose and the prominence of the ossa nasalia, and in females it was about 40%. Although the thickness of the soft tissue is dependent on exogenous factors, such as nutrition, mimicry, and so forth, the dimensions of the bony nose apparently also influence the skin depths to some extent. High and prominent noses were found to have a thinner layer of soft tissue over the nasal bones than short and less prominent ones. It thus seems as if there is a tendency of the soft tissue cover to adjust to disharmonies of the bony profile. \\nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accident Prevention 2)Accidents 3)Human","target":"No","rationale":"The abstract describes a research study that examined the association between morphometric dimensions of external noses in males and females from Vienna, Austria.

POST : Context-\\nThis all happened from last summer over a couple of months, but its something that seems to be reintroducing itself into my life.\\n\\nLast june, I (at the time a 16 y/o trans male) had taken a break from my boyfriend (at the time 18 y/o cis male) . The relationship wasn't bad, but being young we decided to take some time apart to explore more. We had been dating since early highschool, so around 13, and neither of us wanted to miss out on the sluttiness of our teen years.\\nI never really got a chance to meet anyone, but I did enjoy the freedom of flirting with people and so I downloaded grindr, which I know isn't right for someone of that age but everyone else I knew was on it and I thought it might be a laugh. Plus I was very honest about my age to anyone I spoke to. \\nI instantly met one guy (late 30s-early 40s)who very quickly offered me money for sex.\\nI'm not a rich person, I go to art college, and only because its free at my age but I still have to put a lot of money into supplies, and I live with my family, though we're always having a lot of money issues, mostly due to debt. At first I thought it would be some money to spend on myself, I dont often have money to throw around so I considered it, but told him I'd think about it.\\nHe kept sending me messages like 'but I want to see you now!' and I'll pay more to see you tonight' an  being overall very demanding to see me, as well as asking for pictures, which I sent, despite it being as late as 1am, and me having college in the morning. I hate people talking to me like that, and can't stand being pressured into doing things because I tend to make stupid decisions when I am, which I did, and I said I would meet him but only if he picked up condoms on the way.\\nI didn't give him my address but told him to meet me close by and it took him over an hour to get here because he lived that far away from me.\\nHe had a pretty expensive looking car, and when he arrived, I took half the money upfront (£30) and we did what we did in his car. \\nThe sex itself was really painful, forgive the detail but as a trans guy, I was used to anal sex with my now ex bf, but we had normal sex as he hadn't brought any lube and I wasnt about to tear something for him. I told him I wasn't comfortable and it was quite painful and id be happy to give the money back or give him a blowjob instead, but he demanded either sex or anal and being pinned down in someone's car doesn't leave for an easy exit. In the end, I didn't orgasm but he did, not that I was expecting an amazing time in some guys car. \\nHe paid the last £20 and offered me a cigarette and a lift home. We spoke about religion (he was muslim and I'm religious too) and how our families not accepting him being gay and me being trans. it was the middle of the night and freezing even in summer and I stated very explicitly that I wanted to leave but he insisted on talking and then giving me a lift home and not letting me go until I said yes. I still wasnt willing to give him my address and instead got dropped off early, claiming to live across a field that he couldn't drive over, and I walked the rest of the way. \\nThe money was pretty good and from there we started meeting more, and over the course of a couple of weeks, i had saved up about £400 which helped out with bills and things back home, under the guise that I had just been working more hours at my part time job.\\nThings slowly started to get more and more uncomfortable with him, if we were having sex and I asked him to give me a moment or to change position because something was hurting, he would totally ignore me and even once when I downright told him to stop, he continued. \\nI stopped seeing him for a while after that as the summer holidays came around and I started to work more for my actual job, and I was at the point where money didn't seem like a good trade for our nightly activities. He was starting to scare me, it's not easy to sneak out at midnight and meet a guy for carpark sex as a teenager. I sent him a text saying I probably wouldn't see him for a while, blaming it on work and college making me work late hours. \\nThe messages he sent back were pretty violent, calling me a whore and a bitch, threatening me, claiming he knew where I lived and so I started to ignore him. \\neventually i noticed that I hadn't had a period. I worried more and more until I bought a pregnancy test which came up positive. I hadn't spoken to the guy in about 2 weeks, my mother would have killed me if she found out I'd had sex for money and gotten pregnant and the idea of being pregnant just seemed to crush my identity as a trans person and I didn't want to deal with the emotional damage that would bring.\\nI didn't tell anyone except my ex at the time, who welcomed the news with open arms. He said that it was my choice whether to have the child, but either way he'd support me and help wherever needed, even if I decided to keep the dad out of the picture.\\n\\nBy this time, the guy I had paid had calmed down, and tried apologising, quickly going back to his usual messages begging to see me. I needed time to figure out what to do, so I never once replied, nor told him what was happening.\\n\\nIm a smoker and I drink a lot and my friends always share weed, and I had planned on cutting all of that out, but honestly I found myself having a cigarette every 20 minutes and sleeping barely an hour every night, so I'd gone up to over 40 a day. I never had the choice as to whether I would keep the baby as at 4 weeks I had a miscarriage. Not many people know about this even now, my family doesn't know, the guy doesn't know, even my doctor doesn't know we cause I refused to go in case they told my mother.\\n\\nRight now, I'm trying to make things work again with my ex. We'd gotten a lot closer after the whole thing, and even thought more about starting our own family once I was out of college and we had a more stable looking situation, but im still upset over what happened, and part of me feels like shit for leaving this guy in the dark about everything that happened. \\nAm I the asshole here?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author of the post is describing an event that occurred in the past, as they use past tense to describe the events.

That figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice system, according to a new study by the California Commission on Access to Justice, which also found that despite increased spending, the gap between need and services remains substantial. \\"As a practical matter, in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal assistance,\\" said Jack Londen, past commission chair and a partner with Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco. \\"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don't get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\\" California has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million, including nearly one in five children.

Even those with jobs are suffering: 26 percent of California workers earn poverty level wages.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.\\n\\nBig town and Fair town both used petroleum products.

However, CNNs still suffer from a tendency to confidently classify out-distribution samples from unknown classes into pre-defined known classes. Further, they are also vulnerable to adversarial examples. We are relating these two issues through the tendency of CNNs to over-generalize for areas of the input space not covered well by the training set. We show that a CNN augmented with an extra output class can act as a simple yet effective end-to-end model for controlling over-generalization. As an appropriate training set for the extra class, we introduce two resources that are computationally efficient to obtain: a representative natural out-distribution set and interpolated in-distribution samples. To help select a representative natural out-distribution set among available ones, we propose a simple measurement to assess an out-distribution set's fitness. We also demonstrate that training such an augmented CNN with representative out-distribution natural datasets and some interpolated samples allows it to better handle a wide range of unseen out-distribution samples and black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries. Finally, we show that generation of white-box adversarial attacks using our proposed augmented CNN can become harder, as the attack algorithms have to get around the rejection regions when generating actual adversaries.","target":"Properly training CNNs with dustbin class increase their robustness to adversarial attacks and their capacity to deal with out-distribution samples","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nProperly training CNNs with dustbin class increase their robustness to adversarial attacks and their capacity to deal with out-distribution samples."},{"source":"Mike was preparing for his chemistry exam. To see the chemistry concepts in practice he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A he used two liquid reactants evenly dispersed, but in test B he used one liquid reactant and one solid reactant. He was surprised to see that two tests had very different results.\\n\\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: \\n\\nWhich test would have higher rate of reaction, test A or test B?\\n\\nHint: Many reactions take place in solution or in the gas phase, where the reactants are evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants.","target":"test A","rationale":"In test A, the reactants were two liquids. This means that they were evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture and all of their particles could take part in reactions, leading to an overall higher rate of reaction compared to test B.\\nTest B had one solid reactant and one liquid reactant as opposed to both being liquid like in test A. Since the solid was not already mixed together with other reactants it meant that only its surface area would be available for reacting while its \\"interior\\" will not participate at all in any reactions so it is less reactive than the same amount of pure liquid material since more molecules are able to collide if you have a solution or gas phase instead of just some atoms on top layer which can't really go inside because solids don't flow much by"},{"source":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","target":"What can be paired with transmission lines to create phases that would support output?","rationale":"the question is ( What can be paired with transmission lines to create phases that would support output? ) \\nand the answer is: transformer banks"},{"source":"The harder the batter hits the ball, the greater will be its acceleration.\\n\\nIf you use less force when accelerating a car it will go slower or faster?","target":"slower","rationale":"In physics, acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity.

Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.\\n\\nWhereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball, and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.  It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The king set out by the River Thames on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End. The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and William Walworth, the mayor of London, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \\"I am your captain, follow me!\\", he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.  The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Richard II of England","rationale":"The text is focused around Richard II of England and his experiences.

POST : Hi, Reddit and this is a very frustrating and unpleasant situation I found myself in recently. \\nSo I am an opera singer and a 28 y/o woman. Few months ago I worked on a big production in Europe. The production was massive and had over two hundred people involved in it including some actors. \\nOne of them was exceptionally handsome, like high-fashion kind of handsome, and from day one he never concealed his attraction towards me. Let's call him Marco. We flirted but I never really thought about hooking up with him as I was consumed with the show (partly because I was doing the main role). \\nAfter the premiere there was an after-party, and of course I got intoxicated, so did he. Then it was 5 a.m. and he was stranded in the town without any means to get home at that time of night. \\nObviously it was a roose to get into my bed, and I was tipsy and relaxed so I played along. I offered him a sofa in my flat, and of course, next thing I know we are messing in my bedroom. \\nIn the morning (well, more likely, in the late afternoon) we had the post-sex cuddle, and Marco casually mentions that tomorrow is his birthday. I joke about having given him an early bd present to which he laughs and says that it was the best present ever.\\nThen I ask how old he is going to get. And then he drops the bomb: he is going to be 18. Tomorrow. \\n\\nI panicked and quickly got out of the bed. He did not look 17 at all, I thought he was younger but I never thought he was eleven years younger than me. I was mad. He looked surprised and said that \\"he is almost a man\\" and that \\"he had many girlfriends including a 30 y/o when he was 16\\".\\nI screamed that I did not care about his other girlfriends and that I am going to be in big trouble. I did not know the laws of that country so I had all my life flash before my eyes. \\nI begged him to keep his mouth shut and he swore he would never tell anyone.\\n\\nOf course when I got to the theatre the next day everyone was giving me weird looks. By the end of the day I noticed people laughing at me and some of my colleagues even asked me really dirty questions. Not only he bragged about having sex with me to his friends, he also gave them all the details including the amount of body hair, shape of my breasts and all the things I did to him in bed. \\nI was a wreck. I ran into the cafeteria and was weeping incessantly. Never in my life I felt such shame. \\nNext morning I was called into the theatre director's office. He was very disappointed in me and my lifestyle choices, and he also mentioned that as a \\" primadonna\\" (ugh hate that term) I should have known better and taken better care of my reputation.\\nI thought it was over but in few hours I received a phone call from Marco's mother. She was screaming at me and though I speak Italian, I was struggling to understand everything she said.\\nApparently not only I had sex with a 17 y/o but I also raped him as he was drunk and therefore could not possibly consent to sex with \\"a fat old woman\\" that I was in his mother's opinion. She screamed some more and promised to get the police involved. \\nI was devastated. In my view my career was over as well as my reputation. I wished I were dead. \\nHis mother also discovered his messages to me and threatened to expose me a sexual predator, and called me a paedophile. \\nMy colleagues stood up for me and promised to testify if need be that Marco has been chasing after me since day one, and that he has made everything he could to stay at my place that fateful night.\\nJust when i thought my life was over it turned out that Marco's mother tried to blackmail the theatre director into firing me or raising her son's  salary. The director went furious and threatened her with exposure so she backed off.\\n\\nAll this situation was quite horrible for me, and I am glad I am unscathed by the experience although there is (must be!) a stain on my reputation. But as the time passes by and I recover I cannot help but wonder - what if I am a predator? What if I scarred that poor boy? What if I raped him - as he was clearly drunk and I am a grown ass woman and whatnot?\\nThe very thought of it horrifies me as I am a rape survivor myself, and I pray I haven't hurt this young man. \\nWhat do you think, guys? I am so confused and genuinely upset.\\nSorry for the long read.","target":"yes","rationale":"The author describes a past event in which they had sex with someone and later discovered that the person was only 17 years old.

Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans. Further offshoots include the first-language English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans, Zambians, Swazilanders and Namibians.\\n\\n- Canadian English (CanE, CE, en-CA) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada. According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French.\\n\\n- British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"\\n\\n- International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and between nations. It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts.\\n\\n- Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\\nRights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\".\\n\\n- The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. The phrase can be traced back to 16th century Britain, and in the following century the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford used the phrase in his argument against the divine right of kings. John Locke defined freedom under the rule of law as follows:\\n\\n- Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"\\n\\n- Human rights are moral principles or norms, which describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \\"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,\\" and which are \\"inherent in all human beings\\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.\\n\\n- A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'kalmen kaplansky'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- activist\\n - canada\\n - criminal\\n - general\\n - human rights\\n - human rights activist\\n - justice\\n - lawyer\\n - major\\n - official\\n - religion\\n - theologian\\n - torturer\\n - united kingdom","target":"human rights activist","rationale":"Among all the choices, only \\"human rights activist\\" exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject entity 'kalmen kaplansky'."},{"source":"In this task, you have given an input which is agent's reply, based on that you have to identify what will be users' command for that reply.

As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more.

In 2007, however, the housing market crashed causing lots of foreclosures on houses. This rapid high-rise construction, has led to fast population growth in the city's inner neighborhoods, primarily in Downtown, Brickell and Edgewater, with these neighborhoods becoming the fastest-growing areas in the city. The Miami area ranks 8th in the nation in foreclosures. In 2011, Forbes magazine named Miami the second-most miserable city in the United States due to its high foreclosure rate and past decade of corruption among public officials.

Several stations display pre-Columbian artifacts and architecture that were discovered during the metro's construction.[citation needed] However, the metro covers less than half of the total urban area. The Metro stations are also differentiated by the use of icons and glyphs which were proposed for people who could not read.

Targeting dNTP pool sanitizing enzymes, such as MTH1, is a highly promising anticancer strategy. The MTH2 protein, known as NUDT15, is described as the second human homologue of bacterial MutT with 8-oxo-dGTPase activity. We present the first NUDT15 crystal structure and demonstrate that NUDT15 prefers other nucleotide substrates over 8-oxo-dGTP. Key structural features are identified that explain different substrate preferences for NUDT15 and MTH1. We find that depletion of NUDT15 has no effect on incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP into DNA and does not impact cancer cell survival in cell lines tested. NUDT17 and NUDT18 were also profiled and found to have far less activity than MTH1 against oxidized nucleotides. We show that NUDT15 is not a biologically relevant 8-oxo-dGTPase, and that MTH1 is the most prominent sanitizer of the cellular dNTP pool known to date..

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's.\\nOf course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint.\\nDr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician.

After that, I didn’t respond at all, which only made him mad. He starts going on about “how could I move on so quick” and if he meant anything to me, I’d help him get closure.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets.

First, in contrast to the new policy design thinking, disproportionate policy options may be systematically designed, and at times, successfully implemented. Second, in contrast to the new policy design thinking, there are certain conditions under which policymakers may tend to develop effective response, with cost considerations becoming only secondary in importance if at all (read, policy overreaction), or cost-conscious response, with effectiveness considerations becoming only secondary in importance if at all (read, policy underreaction). Third, in contrast to the new policy design thinking, disproportionate policy options may be designed for purposes other than implementation (e.g., to be used as signaling devices or as context-setters). Fourth, in contrast to new policy design thinking, there are certain conditions under which the emotional arena of policy may be equally, if not more, important than the substantive one.

His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

IL-15 is also produced during physical exercise by skeletal muscle and has been reported to reduce weight gain in mice. Contrarily, our findings on IL-15 knockout (KO) mice indicate that IL-15 promotes obesity. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying the pro-obesity role of IL-15 in adipose tissues.   \\n METHODS Control and IL-15 KO mice were maintained on high fat diet (HFD) or normal control diet. After 16 weeks, body weight, adipose tissue and skeletal mass, serum lipid levels and gene/protein expression in the adipose tissues were evaluated. The effect of IL-15 on thermogenesis and oxygen consumption was also studied in primary cultures of adipocytes differentiated from mouse preadipocyte and human stem cells.   \\n RESULTS Our results show that IL-15 deficiency prevents diet-induced weight gain and accumulation of lipids in visceral and subcutaneous white and brown adipose tissues. Gene expression analysis also revealed elevated expression of genes associated with adaptive thermogenesis in the brown and subcutaneous adipose tissues of IL-15 KO mice. Accordingly, oxygen consumption was increased in the brown adipocytes from IL-15 KO mice. In addition, IL-15 KO mice showed decreased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in their adipose tissues.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Absence of IL-15 results in decreased accumulation of fat in the white adipose tissues and increased lipid utilization via adaptive thermogenesis.

Treatment with rat PRL caused dose-related increases in the percentage of mammary cells that released casein and the average size of casein plaques that formed. The assay exhibited exquisite sensitivity (156 fg rat PRL per assay slide) and could be used to evaluate the biopotency of PRL released from individual cells. By combining this \\"plaque bioassay\\" with a standard plaque assay for measuring the secretion of immunoreactive PRL, it was possible to compare the bio- and immuno-potencies of hormone released from the same pituitary cells.

Exercise training resulted in a significant increase in the mean specific activity of cyclic AMP-PDE (pmol X min-1 X mg-1) from the whole homogenate and S48 fraction at cyclic AMP concentrations of 4, 8, and 16 microM and in the P48 fraction at 8 and 16 microM cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP-PDE kinetic plots according to Lineweaver-Burk for the calculation of Michaelis constants (Km) and maximum enzyme velocities (Vmax) were nonlinear, indicating both a low and high enzyme form. The Michaelis constants were significantly lower in trained rats than those of its control for the high Km form of cyclic AMP-PDE in the whole and soluble fractions and for the low Km form of the P5 particulate fraction. The Vmax of the high Km form of the P48 particulate fraction from trained animals was also significantly higher than that found in its control. Phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines in the various fractions was similar in both trained and sedentary animals.

Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December.\\nWar's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday.

You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous.

This MRSA infection is referred to as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infection and is distinct from hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) infection, which occurs among people with known healthcare risk factors. Understanding the epidemiology of CA-MRSA infections is critical; however, this has not been investigated in detail in Japan. Our objective was to investigate the incidence of CA-MRSA infections in a regional hospital. We investigated CA-MRSA isolates and infections in a rural regional hospital by reviewing medical records of one year. Infections were classified as CA-MRSA if no established risk factors were identified. During 2008, 31 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates were detected in 29 unique patients, with 1 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolates obtained from 19 patients (66%) and MRSA obtained from 10 patients (34%). In the 10 patients with MRSA, the number of HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA cases were nine (32% of patients with S. aureus isolates) and one (3%), respectively. The patient with CA-MRSA was diagnosed with cellulitis due to CA-MRSA. All nine patients with HA-MRSA exhibited colonization. We observed a CA-MRSA case in a regional hospital in Japan, suggesting that incidence trends of CA-MRSA should be considered in future research and treatment. \\n Question: What is MRSA?","target":"mrsa","rationale":"The correct answer should be \\"mrsa\\", which is the shortest continous span in the context passage."}]`),W={components:{PoemCard:q},data(){return{poemsData:M,visibleCount:6,isLoading:!1}},computed:{hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],D={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,c,m,i,s){const r=v("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Chain of Thought 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",P,[d(r,{poems:i.poemsData},null,8,["poems"])]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),n("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",D,"See more"))],8,H)):k("",!0)])}const E=u(W,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-360e1ad1"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/28.md","filePath":"people/28.md"}'),O={name:"people/28.md"},F=Object.assign(O,{setup(o){return(e,c)=>(a(),n("div",null,[d(E)]))}});export{j as __pageData,F as default};
