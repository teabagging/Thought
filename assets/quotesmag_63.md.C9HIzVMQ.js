KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca.

The band, fronted by Dangers (the only permanent member), has proven versatile over the years, experimenting with techno, dubstep, drum and bass, IDM, industrial, dub and jazz fusion while touring the world and influencing major acts such as Nine Inch Nails, The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy. Some of the band's earlier work has been credited with influencing the rise of the trip hop, big beat, and drum and bass genres.\\nContext: In 1993 Dangers relocated from England to San Francisco, resulting in Stephens' departure from the band. At this time, Nothing Records was founded as an imprint of Interscope with the purpose of signing industrial and electronic bands to capitalize on the recent success of Nine Inch Nails. Nothing, helmed by Trent Reznor, signed Meat Beat Manifesto and in 1996 the double album Subliminal Sandwich was released. While this album represented MBM's major-label debut, it failed to achieve the critical and commercial successes of previous releases. The album is notable for the last appearance of Jonny Stephens who contributed guitar on the track Asbestos Lead Asbestos. After Subliminal Sandwich, Dangers put together an album called Original Fire that collected various studio rarities, B-sides, and fan favorites from the early years of MBM, in addition to some new remixes of the material. Also in 1996, the group contributed to the AIDS benefit album Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip produced by the Red Hot Organization.  In 1997 Dangers recruited drummer Lynn Farmer and multi-instrumentalist John Wilson (MBM member 1995-1998 former Supreme Love Gods) to record and release Actual Sounds + Voices in 1998, which found the group's earlier flirtations with jazz fusion featured more prominently; the record included appearances by saxophonist Bennie Maupin. The album yielded the single \\"Prime Audio Soup\\" which was featured in the film The Matrix. While Jon Wilson left the band prior to the 1998-1999 tour, Farmer remains with the band as of Spring 2007. Wilson was replaced by former Consolidated programmer Mark Pistel, who also remains a contributing member.  During these years, Dangers contributed a pair of remixes to high-profile Nine Inch Nails releases Closer to God and The Perfect Drug. After the release of Actual Sounds + Voices, Meat Beat Manifesto was let go by Nothing Records and once more appeared on independent labels.\\nQuestion: what is nothing records\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Nothing Records was founded as an imprint of Interscope with the purpose of signing industrial and electronic bands","rationale":"From the given context, we can infer that Nothing Records was founded as an imprint of Interscope with the purpose of signing industrial and electronic bands to capitalize on the recent success of Nine Inch Nails.\\n\\nSo from this, it is clear that \\"\\"Nothing records\\"\\" is a sub-label (imprint) for \\"Interscope\\" which specializes in producing Industrial/Electronic music."},{"source":"You are given a list of queries separated by new line.

He was trained in Lancaster and practised throughout his career from an office in Chester. Initially he ran the practice on his own, but from 1884 until two years before his death he worked in partnerships with two of his former assistants.\\nDouglas's output included new churches, restoring and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, new houses and alterations to existing houses, and a variety of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were eclectic. Douglas worked during the period of the Gothic Revival, and many of his works incorporate elements of the English Gothic style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings, in particular half-timbering, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, pargeting, and the use of decorative brick in diapering and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of joinery and highly detailed wood carving.\\nThroughout his career he attracted commissions from wealthy landowners and industrialists, especially the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall. Most of his works have survived, particularly his churches.

He founded the pioneering band Death in 1983. Schuldiner is often referred to as \\"The Godfather of death metal\\", and his obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine said that \\"Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.\\"\\n\\nSchuldiner formed Death as Mantas in 1983 when he was just 16 years old. Original members were Schuldiner (guitar), Rick Rozz (guitar) and Kam Lee (drums and vocals). In January 1986, Schuldiner moved to Toronto and temporarily joined the Canadian band Slaughter. However, he quickly returned to continue the formation of Death.  Death underwent many lineup changes. With Chris Reifert, Schuldiner eventually released the first Death album, titled Scream Bloody Gore, in 1987. He continued with 1988's Leprosy with the line-up of former Mantas guitarist Rick Rozz and rhythm section Terry Butler on bass and Bill Andrews on drums, and 1990's Spiritual Healing, where guitarist James Murphy had replaced the fired Rozz in 1989.  After Spiritual Healing, Schuldiner stopped working with full-time band members, preferring to work with studio and live venue musicians, due to bad relationships with Death's previous rhythm section and guitarists. This earned Schuldiner something of a 'perfectionist' reputation in the metal community. Schuldiner had also fired his manager Eric Greif but settled and re-hired him before the recording of his next, influential release.  Death's breakthrough album, Human saw the band evolving to a more technical and progressive style, in which Schuldiner displayed his guitar skills more than ever. He continued in this style (and continued the success of the band) with 1993's Individual Thought Patterns, 1995's Symbolic, and finally The Sound of Perseverance in 1998. Throughout his career, Schuldiner was not afraid to take on controversial lyrical subjects, taking an anti-drug stance on \\"Living Monstrosity\\" and writing about abortion in \\"Altering the Future\\".  He put Death on hold after this to continue Control Denied, which he had been putting together prior to the release of The Sound of Perseverance, and released The Fragile Art of Existence in 1999. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured a melodic metal vocalist. Schuldiner also played guitar in the \\"supergroup\\" Voodoocult on the album Jesus Killing Machine in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, Of Hell on the track \\"As Ancients Evolve\\" as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked to be one of the many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on. In a 1999 interview Schuldiner spoke about why he didn't sing on the album The Fragile Art of Existence \\"...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. I think people will be surprised at the violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.\\n\\n- A multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments at a professional level. Multi-instrumentalists who play closely related instruments, a practice known as doubling are common in orchestra (e.g., flute players who double on piccolo and percussion players, who play snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, etc.), in jazz (e.g., saxophone players who double on clarinet or flute; or double bass players who also play electric bass); in music theatre pit orchestras (e.g., reed players who are required to play numerous reed instruments); and in other areas of classical music (e.g., church piano players are often expected to play the church's pipe organ or Hammond organ as well). Popular music composers and songwriters are often multi-instrumentalists. In pop and rock, it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be multi-instrumentalists on instruments that are not from the same family: it is common for pop and rock musicians to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording.\\n\\n- Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes.\\n\\n- A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". \\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n- Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: \\"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres  drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\\"\\n\\n- Baduizm is the debut album by American R&B and neo soul singer-songwriter Erykah Badu, released on February 11, 1997 by Kedar Records. After leaving university in order to concentrate on music full-time, Badu then began touring with her cousin, Robert \\"Free\\" Bradford, where she recorded a 19-song demo, \\"Country Cousins\\", which attracted the attention of Kedar Massenburg. He set Badu up to record a duet with D'Angelo, \\"Your Precious Love,\\" and eventually signed her to a record deal with Universal Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during January to October 1996 at Battery Studios in New York City, Sigma Sounds & Ivory Studios in Philadelphia, and Dallas Sound Lab in Dallas.\\n\\n- Erykah Abi Wright (born Erica Abi Wright; February 26, 1971), better known by her stage name Erykah Badu, is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, disc jockey, activist, and actress.

Her first album, \\"Baduizm\\", was released on February 11, 1997. It spawned three singles: \\"On & On\\", \\"Next Lifetime\\" and \\"Otherside of the Game\\". The album was certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\\nBadu's first live album, \\"Live\\", was released on November 18, 1997 and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.\\n\\n- Neo soul is a genre of popular music. The term was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.\\n\\n- Roy Ayers (born September 10, 1940) is an American funk, soul, and jazz composer and vibraphone player. Ayers began his career as a post-bop jazz artist, releasing several albums with Atlantic Records, before his tenure at Polydor Records beginning in the 1970s, during which he helped pioneer jazz-funk. He is a key figure in the acid jazz movement, which is a mixture of jazz into hip-hop and funk, and has been dubbed by many as \\"The Godfather of Neo Soul\\". He is most well known for his signature compositions \\"Everybody Loves The Sunshine\\" and \\"Searchin\\", and is also famous for having more sampled hits by rappers than any other artist.\\n\\n- William \\"Kedar\\" Massenburg is an American record producer and record label executive, who was the president of Motown Records from 1997 to 2004.

It was recorded between 1999 and 2000 at Electric Lady Studios in New York and released on November 21, 2000, by Motown Records. A neo soul album, \\"Mama's Gun\\" incorporates funk, soul, and jazz styles. It has confessional lyrics by Badu, which cover themes of insecurity, social issues and personal relationships. The album has been viewed by critics as a female companion to neo soul artist D'Angelo's second album \\"Voodoo\\" (2000), which features a similar musical style and direction. Critics have also noted that while \\"Baduizm\\" contained its share of cryptic lyricism, \\"Mama's Gun\\" is much more direct in its approach, and places the artist in a subjective position more than its predecessor.\\n\\n- Polydor is a British record label and company, that operates as part of Universal Music Group. It has a close relationship with Universal's Interscope Geffen A&M label, which distributes Polydor's releases in the United States. In turn, Polydor distributes Interscope releases in the United Kingdom. Polydor Records Ltd. was established in 1954 British subsidiary in London by German Deutsche Grammophon GmbH. It was renamed in 1972 to Polydor Ltd.\\n\\n- The vibraphone (also known as the vibraharp or simply the vibes) is a musical instrument in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion family.\\n\\n- Musical collective is a phrase used to describe a group of musicians who collaborate over time to perform, record or compose music.\\n\\n- \`\` Cleva '' is the third and final single from American singer Erykah Badu 's second studio album , Mama 's Gun ( 2000 ) .

In other applications, they can be used to keep sharks away from areas they may be a danger to themselves due to human activity.

We identify hyaluronan, or hyaluronic acid (HA), as the primary matrix determinant of these barriers and show that systemic administration of an enzymatic agent can ablate stromal HA from autochthonous murine PDA, normalize IFP, and re-expand the microvasculature.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers.

POST : ok so a bit of back story real quick; me and my buddy lets call him \\"Conner\\" have known each other for 9 years and have been roommates for 4 years. last march we moved into a new apartment, closer to my job and his collage, and since it's a bit more expensive and we have an extra room now Conner asked if his friend who I've only met maybe twice before could move in with us. i didn't have a problem with this, the guy seemed cool the couple of times i'd seen him and they wen't to the same collage so it looked like a good deal all round. it wasn't.\\n\\nso moving day comes and me and Conner are already unpacking our things into our rooms when, let's call him josh, calls Conner asking when the truck was coming. we were a bit confused but sometimes miscommunications happen so Conner drove over and helped move his stuff. now the problems started when josh gets to the apartment drops his maybe 5 boxes in his room, starts looking around and complains about the colour of paint on the walls, there being no balcony, him not getting the biggest room etc. but the real problem was when he came into my room (the biggest room) takes one look at my iguana and has a conniption fit.\\n\\nmy iguanas name is Sir Gregory, he is 5 years old so as you can imagine he's pretty big. but conner had told josh not once, not twice, but five fucking times that there would be a giant lizard in the house, even sent a picture. this is also why i have the biggest room, because i needed the space for gregs tank. but josh apparently had never seen an iguana and wanted him gone, when we told him that greg is not going anywhere he started talking about how im crazy for keeping a \\"crazy fucking gator\\" and that greg would \\"kill us in our sleep\\". he did eventually calm down but never tried to warm up to greg. things were fine for the most part after that until we met joshes girlfriend, lets call her Britney because she is the living embodiment of a briteny. josh and britney would do one of 3 things whenever she was over, they'd a. have very loud arguments b. have very loud sex or c. just be really obnoxious in other ways. this isn't even mentioning the times josh would invite people over at 1am or would eat or take things that didn't belong to him, i will admit there were a few times i was a dick to him, didn't remind him of something, called his girlfriend a cunt, purposely didn't grab things at the store that he wanted, didn't drive him to his class on my day off after he woke up 2 hours late.\\n\\nbut my boiling point was when stole my car for a day to go to some concert. after the entire day of talking to the police, calling around and panicking on how i was going to get to work, josh walks in tosses me my car keys and tells me that the tank was empty. i'm not ashamed to say i lost my absolute shit. i told conner then and there that i wanted him gone as soon as physically possible. \\"i don't care where he goes but i don't want him here!\\" this of course led to a fight between me and josh, he called me a bitch, said he  how puts up with greg, said that since i didn't drive him that one time i owed him my car for awhile i have no right to be pissed\\". conner told me that im over reacting and that \\"it's just how he was brought up\\" and \\"he just doesn't understand and to put up with it\\"\\n\\nis there something im genuinely missing?  like he didn't sell or destroy my car which is good but really?","target":"yes","rationale":"The author describes a past event in which they moved into an apartment with their friend and his friend, who ended up being a poor roommate.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers.\\nIf you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions.\\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\\nCentral to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

In response, Cobain made the band play the riff for an hour and a half. Eventually, Novoselic began playing the riff more slowly, inspiring drummer Dave Grohl to create the drum beat. As a result, it is the only song on Nevermind to credit all three band members as writers.Prior to the Nevermind recording sessions, the band sent Vig a cassette demo of song rehearsals including \\"Teen Spirit\\". While the sound of the tape was distorted due to the band playing at a loud volume, Vig felt the song had promise. Vig and the band recorded \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" at Sound City recording studio in Van Nuys, California in May 1991.

Thanks!\\" He gets upset! I'm direct (but tactful) and I can't say things in a direct manner because he flips out and accuses me of \\"blaming\\" him and of being \\"overly critical\\". He also does this when it comes to the kids. He has a 15 year old son from a previous relationship and I have a 5 year old son. My son has chores and does more things around the house than my husband or my stepson. My stepson has no chores, constantly has issues at school for not turning in homework, and spends all of his time sleeping or playing video games.

The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia. Their confederation of States became today's Negeri Sembilan (\\"Nine States\\"), with Seremban as its capital. The name Minangkabau itself means roughly \\"buffalo horns\\" and is reflected in the distinctive upward curving roof in museums and government offices built in the traditional Minangkabau style. The Bugis were energetic merchants and great sailors. With the Dutch concentrating once more on Java and the Moluccas in the 18th century, the Bugis took advantage of the vacuum by raiding Perak and Kedah, imposing their chieftains in Selangor and becoming the power behind the throne in Johor. The Bugis in Johor's administration provided much of the spirit in that State's independent stand in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what...\\n\\nQuestion: What became impossible for Benjamin?\\nI think \\"Singing\\" is a valid answer.

Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.\\n\\n- The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family.\\n\\n- Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America.

This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.\\n\\n- An inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a stem that is composed of a main branch or a complicated arrangement of branches. Morphologically, it is the part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed and which is accordingly modified. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes.\\nInflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern.\\n\\n- The pseudobulb is a storage organ found in many epiphytic and terrestrial sympodial orchids. It is derived from a thickening of the part of a stem between leaf nodes and may be composed of just one internode or several, termed heteroblastic and homoblastic respectively. All leaves and inflorescences usually arise from this structure. Pseudobulbs formed from a single internode produce the leaves and inflorescence from the top, while those that are formed from several internodes can possess leaves along its length. The modified sheath leaves that appear at the base of a pseudobulb and often enfold all or part of it are usually dry and papery, though in some orchids the sheaths bear leaf blades and the leaves at the pseudobulb's apex are reduced to scales.\\n\\n- Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America.

The abbreviation used in horticultural trade is \\"Stan.\\" The genus is named for the 4th Earl of Stanhope (Philip Henry Stanhope) (1781-1855), president of the Medico-Botanical Society of London (1829-1837). It comprises 55 species and 5 natural hybrids. These epiphytic, but occasionally terrestrial orchids can be found in damp forests from Mexico to Trinidad to NW Argentina. Their ovate pseudobulbs carry from the top one long, plicate, elliptic leaf.\\n\\n- In botany, shoots consist of stems including their appendages, the leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds. The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants.\\n\\n- Connation in plants is the developmental fusion of organs of the same type, for example, petals to one another to form a tubular corolla. This is in contrast to adnation, the fusion of dissimilar organs. Such organs are described as connate or adnate, respectively. When like organs that are usually well separated are placed next to each other, but not actually connected, they are described as connivent (that is the case for anthers in several genera, such as \\"Solanum\\").\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'soterosanthus'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- area\\n - argentina\\n - bear\\n - cocos\\n - delta\\n - gongora\\n - la\\n - magnoliophyta\\n - orchidaceae\\n - plant\\n - seed plants\\n - solanum\\n - stanhopea","target":"orchidaceae","rationale":"The object entity that has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'soterosanthus' is orchidaceae."},{"source":"In this task, you have to generate the title of the recipe given its required ingredients and directions.\\n\\ningredients:  '2 jars (2 oz.)

Maternal pinealectomy eliminated the influence of prenatal photoperiod on testicular and body weights of male pups, suggesting that a product from the maternal pineal gland communicates daylength to the fetus.

He pitched from 1965 to 1988 for six different teams in his career, but it is his time with the Philadelphia Phillies where he received his greatest acclaim as a professional and won four Cy Young Awards. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of any left-handed pitcher (4th overall), and the second-most lifetime wins of any left-handed pitcher (11th overall).\\nContext: Following a salary dispute, Cardinals owner Gussie Busch ordered Carlton traded. Eventually, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies before the 1972 season for pitcher Rick Wise.  The trade is now considered one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history. However, at the time, the trade appeared to make sense from the Cardinals' perspective. Carlton had won 77 games to Wise's 75, and both were considered among the game's best pitchers. Tim McCarver, who had caught for Carlton in St. Louis and for Wise in Philadelphia, described the trade as \\"a real good one for a real good one.\\" He felt Carlton had more raw talent, but Wise had better command on the mound. Although Wise would stay in the majors for another 11 years (though only two of them were with the Cardinals), the trade is now reckoned as an epoch-making deal for the Phillies, as well as one of the worst trades in Cardinals history.  In Carlton's first season with Philadelphia, he led the league in wins (27), complete games (30), strikeouts (310), and ERA (1.97), despite playing for a team whose final record was 59-97. His 1972 performance earned him his first Cy Young Award and the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year. His having won 46% of his team's victories that season is a record in modern major league history. Carlton attributed his success to his grueling training regimen, which included Eastern martial arts techniques, the most famous of which was twisting his fist to the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket of rice.  Some highlights of Carlton's 1972 season included starting the season with 5 wins and 1 loss, then losing 5 games in a row, during which period the Phillies scored only 10 runs. At this point he began a 15-game winning streak. After it ended at a 20-6 record, he finished the final third of the year with 7 more wins and 4 losses, ending with 27 wins and 10 losses. Carlton also completed 30 of 41 starts.  During the 18 games of the winning streak (3 were no-decisions), Carlton pitched 155 innings, allowed 103 hits and 28 runs (only 17 in the 15 winning games), allowed 39 walks, and had 140 strikeouts. From July 23, 1972 to August 13, 1972 he pitched five complete game victories, allowed only 1 unearned run while only giving up 22 hits in 45 innings, and threw four shutouts. He had a fastball, a legendary slider, and a long looping curve ball; and later a change-up, then a screwball. Baseball commentators during 1972 regularly remarked that Carlton's slider was basically unhittable, while Pittsburgh Pirates slugger Willie Stargell once remarked, \\"Hitting Steve Carlton's slider is like trying to drink coffee with a fork\\". He was also a good hitter for a pitcher; at times he pinch-hit for the Phillies during 1972.\\nQuestion: How did he end up going to the Phillies?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Following a salary dispute, Cardinals owner Gussie Busch ordered Carlton traded.

During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the \\"Badami Chalukyas\\", ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakeshin II. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century.\\nThe rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called \\"Chalukyan architecture\\".

The governor of Novgorod Paletsky sent Nikita Kuzmin to Stockholm to ask for an explanation, but the Russian representative was imprisoned. In response Russia mounted an organized attack with up to 20,000 soldiers in March 1555. With its initially 1,000 men, Finland could not stand against the invading troops, but soon, reinforcements consisting of 3,700 infantrymen and 250 cavalrymen arrived from Sweden. The Finnish nobility had also been engaged in the war, contributing with its cavalry. The goal of the Swedish-Finnish troops was to conquer Oreshek, Korela and Koporye. The siege of Oreshek was badly planned by the Swedish side and failed since the Russians had destroyed the areas surrounding the town and the Swedish troops had insufficient supplies to be able to maintain the siege until the town surrendered. While admiral Johan Brigge besieged and bombarded Oreshek,  the Swedish diplomats tried to find support for their cause in Livonia, Poland-Lithuania and England. Early the following year, 1556, Russia made a new attack, this time with an army almost 20,000 men strong. The attack was aimed at the town of Viborg , and the Swedish troops were unlikely to withstand an army of that considerable size. However, after a few days of pillaging in the area around Viborg, the Russian forces left. The reason for this has not been made clear.

It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state.

Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters.

Nearly 300 birds were killed during the competition, leaving a crime scene of feathers and blood. This is the only event in Olympic history that involved killing live animals.\\nKabaddi (1936)\\nThis sport is popular in South Asia. The object is for one member of a team to enter the other side's half of the field, and score points. The attacker then returns to his half of the field.\\n12 Hour Bicycle Race (1896)\\nSeven riders got on their bikes at 5 a.m. and rode until 5 p.m. Four riders dropped out before noon, but the winner, Adolf Schmal of Austria, managed about 180 miles. Only Schmal and one other finished.\\nTug of War (1900--1920)\\nThis may seem like a basic PE class sport more than an Olympic event, but Tug of War was actually one of the first sports played at the Olympic games in 500 BC.\\nThere are two teams of eight; the winning team must pull the other team six feet forward.\\nSwimming Obstacle Race (1900)\\nThe athletes had to climb over a pole   and a row of boats, and then swim under another row of boats. All of this was done in the Seine River, so they also had to fight against the water.

A carbine is a shorter version of a musket or rifle. Carabiniers were first introduced during the Napoleonic wars in Europe. The word is derived from the identical French word \\"carabinier\\".\\n\\n- The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.\\n\\n- The Chapman Stick (\\"The Stick\\") is an electric musical instrument devised by Emmett Chapman in the early 1970s. A member of the guitar family, the Chapman Stick usually has ten or twelve individually tuned strings and has been used on music recordings to play bass lines, melody lines, chords, or textures. Designed as a fully polyphonic chordal instrument, it can also cover several of these musical parts simultaneously.\\n\\n- Jón Þór \\"Jónsi\\" Birgisson (born 23 April 1975) is the guitarist and vocalist for the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós. He is known for his use of a cello bow on guitar and his falsetto or countertenor voice. He is blind in his right eye from birth as a result of a broken optic nerve from the brain. He is openly gay. Apart from Sigur Rós, Jónsi also performs together with his partner Alex Somers as an art collaboration called Jónsi & Alex. They released their self-titled first book in November 2006, which was an embossed hardcover limited to 1000 copies, along with their first album, \\"Riceboy Sleeps\\", in July 2009. \\nOn 1 December 2009, Jónsi's official website, jonsi.com, was launched in anticipation of his debut solo album, \\"Go\\", which was released the week of 5 April 2010. After the release of the album, Jónsi promptly started a worldwide tour across North America and Europe, featuring songs from the album plus a few other selections, planning to tour from March to September.\\n\\n- James Patrick \\"Jimmy\\" Page, (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter, and record producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin.\\n\\n- Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music.\\n\\n- Ned Steinberger (b. Princeton, New Jersey, 1948) is an American creator of innovative musical instruments. He is most notable for his design of guitars and basses without a traditional headstock, which are called Steinberger instruments. He also has a line of electric basses and string instruments through his company called NS Design and was also the designer of the first ever Spector bass, the NS.\\n\\n- A carabiner or karabiner is a specialized type of shackle, a metal loop with a spring-loaded gate used to quickly and reversibly connect components, most notably in safety-critical systems. The word is a shortened form of \\"Karabinerhaken\\", a German phrase for a \\"spring hook\\" used by a carbine rifleman, or carabinier, to attach items to a belt or bandolier.\\n\\n- The NS/Stick is an 8 string tapping instrument designed by Emmett Chapman and Ned Steinberger. It incorporates design ideas from both the original Stick and from Ned Steinberger's instruments such as the Stick's tapping fretboard and the Steinberger Bass' knee bar and headless design. The player can position the instrument upright for tapping or lower it to a horizontal position for picking, slapping, or strumming.\\n\\n- Emmett Chapman (born September 28, 1936) is a jazz musician best known as the inventor of the Chapman Stick and maker of Chapman Stick family of instruments.\\n\\n- Bowed guitar is a method of playing a guitar, acoustic or electric, in which the guitarist uses a bow to play the instrument, similar to playing a viola da gamba. Unlike other bowed instruments, the guitar has a flat bridge, making it difficult to bow individual notes on the middle strings. The technique is most closely associated with Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, The Yardbirds, and Jónsi of Sigur Ros.\\n\\n- Don Schiff ( born November 9 , 1955 ) is a bass guitar , Chapman Stick , NS / Stick , and bowed guitar player on recordings , TV , and film sessions . He is one of the earliest Stick , NS / Stick , and bowed guitar players . He helped popularize the NS / Stick and a technique of using a carabiner as a slide and tapping device . A native of Wilmington , Delaware , Schiff moved to Las Vegas , Nevada immediately after high school in 1974 . At age 19 he quickly developed a reputation and within five months got his first break when hired to be the ' house bassist ' for the Flamingo Las Vegas and Hilton Hotel Showrooms . There , he played for such artists as Elvis Presley , Tina Turner , Peggy Lee , Sammy Davis , Jr. , Ann - Margret , Perry Como , and The 5th Dimension , as well as others . Schiff purchased his first Chapman Stick in 1975 and quickly adapted to it , creating his own style of playing . Gradually , around the time he was making the move to Los Angeles in 1977 , he began using it during live dates and recording sessions for various artists including Eddie Money , Lana Lane , Dwight Yoakam , Erik Norlander and Sheryl Crow . He met screenwriter and director Patrick Sean Duncan who hired him to score the films Live From Death Row and Family Values . He can be seen briefly in both of those films since Pat Duncan cast him in films he directed , placing him in odd scenes . In 2000 , Emmett Chapman and Ned Steinberger developed the first prototype NS / Stick . Schiff was given one of the first two prototypes to try out . He developed many new techniques on it including \`\` tapping while plucking '' and \`\` slide technique '' using a carabiner while tapping . The song \`\` Cerebral Man '' , which he wrote along with Tully Winfield , was recorded by Pat Benatar on her album entitled Wide Awake in Dreamland for which he received a gold album in 1988 .

By 1977, some radio stations, like New York's WTFM and NBC-owned WYNY, had switched to an all-soft rock format. By the 1980s, tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change, including musical artists such as Journey. Walter Sabo and his team at NBC brought in major personalities from the AM Band to the FM Band taking the format from a background to a foreground listening experience. The addition of major radio stars such as Dan Daniel, Steve O'Brien, Dick Summers, Don Bleu and Tom Parker made it possible to fully monetize the format and provide the foundation for financial success enjoyed to this day\\nWhat is the answer to this question: What artist released the best selling album of the 1970s?","target":"Fleetwood Mac","rationale":"The context mentions that the album Rumours by Fleetwood Mac was the best selling of the decade.

Those are automatically YTA material. \\n\\nNow she has always loved animals, which I get and I love them to, but not to the extent which she does. Animals are a lot of work and a lot of money to take care of between the food, the litter, (for cats which is what we have) replacing the litter boxes every so often, etc... Well when we first got together she had 2 cats. Fine and dandy, 2 is manageable and I like cats so no big deal. Well after picking up a few strays along the way, and not having the money to get them fixed when we should have (don't start about that, I get it, bad cat owners. Remember what I said about them being expensive?) we eventually topped off at 6 permanent cats with litters of kittens that we got rid of along the way. It hasn't been easy and its caused a lot of stress between us and to us personally but we made it through. Last year we lost two of our cats due to health complications (we got them to the vet, they were sick with feline leukemia and we had to have them euthanized for different reasons between the two of them). It was very hard on both of us but we were back down to a manageable, albeit not ideal, 4 cats. Well guess what? The only female kitten we have got pregnant again and had a litter of 5 kitten, we still have all 5 6 months later with no end in sight. Oh, and guess what? She's pregnant again and about to burst. Our last male cat has an appointment to be fixed this month and I told her outright that if he doesnt get fixed, and the kittens that are 6 months old aren't gone by the end of the month, I'm leaving. \\n\\nNow let me explain why, besides the ridiculous amount of stress it puts on me since I'm currently staying home and have to clean up after 9 cats, and stay up all night to make sure the kittens don't end up pregnant. When our pregnant cat has kittens again, I can see her current kittens causing issues for the new litter. The current litter likes to try to be around mom, obviously, but the mom doesnt like it, I guess because she's pregnant again. So I can see that being a problem when mom is with her new litter. I also am fearful for the health of not only our cats, but the 6-month old litter. Feline leukemia is contagious and we aren't yet sure which of our cats, if any more, have it. The longer this litter is around our cats, the more susceptible they are to the disease. Also the 6-month old litter is causing a lot of stress to our current cats, cause we simply dont have room for 9 cats plus ANOTHER litter right now. \\n\\nI'm at the end of my rope. She won't meet me halfway when it comes to getting rid of them. The animal shelter is very expensive to surrender them to ($100 per kitten) amd she doesnt want to post them online because she wants to make sure they go to a good home, which I understand but look what that's costing us. I left home almost a week ago to get a break from all the cats and if it were up to me I wouldnt go back, but I wanted to make it clear to her that I absolutely would be leaving again for good if the kittens weren't gone by the end of the month and our last male cat wasn't fixed.

Joyce was described by Shackleton's biographer, Roland Huntford, as \\"a strange mixture of fraud, flamboyance and ability\\", but his depot-laying work during the Nimrod expedition had impressed Shackleton. Ernest Wild, a Royal Naval petty officer, was added to the party possibly through the persuasion of his brother, Frank Wild, who was travelling as Shackleton's second-in-command on Endurance.Some of the appointments to the party were made rather hurriedly, reflecting the limited time frame that Shackleton had allowed for preliminary organisation.

Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC.

This structure is key to keeping your abstract focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image.\\n\\nIn recent years, the immune-potentiating effects of some widely used chemotherapeutic agents have been increasingly appreciated. This provides a rationale for combining conventional chemotherapy with immunotherapy strategies to achieve durable therapeutic benefits. Previous studies have implicated the immunomodulatory effects of melphalan, an alkylating agent commonly used to treat multiple myeloma, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In the present study, we investigated the impact of melphalan on endogenous immune cells as well as adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells in tumor-bearing mice. We showed that melphalan treatment resulted in a rapid burst of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the cellular recovery phase after melphalan-induced myelodepletion and leukodepletion. After melphalan treatment, tumor cells exhibited characteristics of immunogenic cell death, including membrane translocation of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident calreticulin and extracellular release of high-mobility group box 1. Additionally, there was enhanced tumor Ag uptake by dendritic cells in the tumor-draining lymph node. Consistent with these immunomodulatory effects, melphalan treatment of tumor-bearing mice led to the activation of the endogenous CD8(+) T cells and, more importantly, effectively drove the clonal expansion and effector differentiation of adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells. Notably, the combination of melphalan and CD4(+) T cell adoptive cell therapy was more efficacious than either treatment alone in prolonging the survival of mice with advanced B cell lymphomas or colorectal tumors. These findings provide mechanistic insights into melphalan's immunostimulatory effects and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of combining melphalan with adoptive cell therapy utilizing antitumor CD4(+) T cells.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract starts with a general introduction to the study, and then provides an in-depth description of the methods used, results obtained, and conclusions reached.

The game was the first at the newly christened University of Phoenix Stadium, which signed its naming rights deal with the Cardinals two days after Arizona's last home game vs. St. Louis. The Cards started off hot as Matt Leinart, making his first NFL start, threw two touchdowns in the first quarter to his two top targets, Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald.  The Chiefs responded early in the second quarter with a 45-yard field goal by kicker Lawrence Tynes, and a touchdown pass from quarterback Damon Huard to running back Larry Johnson.  Cards kicker Neil Rackers added a 41-yard field at the end of the first half. Another Rackers field goal, this time from 45 yards, accounted for the only score in the third quarter.  The Chiefs then scored 13 unanswered points to win the game, with a touchdown pass from Huard to Samie Parker, and two field goals by Tynes (40, 19).  Tynes' last field goal was set up by a 78-yard screen pass from Huard to Johnson.  Johnson suffered a sprained neck at the end of the play on a violent face mask tackle by Cards' cornerback Antrel Rolle, who was fined $12,500 for the penalty. A last second 51-yard field goal attempt by Rackers to send the game to overtime failed, giving the Cards their fourth straight loss.

Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- The eagle rays are a group of cartilaginous fishes in the family Myliobatidae, consisting mostly of large species living in the open ocean rather than on the sea bottom.\\n\\n- In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard).\\n\\n- Dasyatis ( Greek \`\` dasys '' meaning rough or dense and \`\` batus '' meaning skate ) is a genus of stingray . The members of the genus Neotrygon were formerly included in Dasyatis .\\n\\n- Myliobatiformes is one of the four orders of batoids, cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. They were formerly included in the order Rajiformes, but more recent phylogenetic studies have shown the myliobatiforms to be a monophyletic group, and its more derived members evolved their highly flattened shapes independently of the skates.\\n\\n- Stingrays are a group of rays, which are cartilaginous fish related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).\\n\\n- The whiptail stingrays are a family, the Dasyatidae, of rays in the order Myliobatiformes. They are found worldwide in tropical to temperate marine waters, and a number of species have also penetrated into fresh water in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Members of this family have flattened pectoral fin discs that range from oval to diamond-like in shape. Their common name comes from their whip-like tails, which are much longer than the disc and lack dorsal and caudal fins. All whiptail stingrays, except the porcupine ray (\\"Urogymnus asperrimus\\"), have one or more venomous stings near the base of the tail, which is used in defense. They range in size from or more across.\\n\\n- A whip is a tool, in various forms, traditionally designed to strike animals or people, or both, in order to control and punish. The capacity to inflict pain is the most instrumental property of a whip, although many animal-goading whips are used simply to tap the creature and provide guidance, as in dressage. Whips fall generally into two categories: firm, at most moderately flexible stick-like forms used to strike directly; and highly-flexible whips, with or without an inflexible hand, that require a specialised swing or \\"crack\\" motion to use. This second category can exert greater force and typically has a longer range. \\n\\n- Urotrygonidae is a family of rays in the order Myliobatiformes, commonly referred to as the American round stingrays or round rays. They are native to the tropical and warm temperate marine waters of the Americas. The two genera in this family were formerly placed within the family Urolophidae, whose species are now restricted to the Indo-Pacific. They have a round pectoral fin disk, a slender tail with a caudal fin, no dorsal fins, and a venomous tail spine.\\n\\n- The Urolophidae are a family of rays in the order Myliobatiformes, commonly known as stingarees or round stingrays; this family formerly included the genera \\"Urobatis\\" and \\"Urotrygon\\" of the Americas, which are presently recognized as forming their own family Urotrygonidae. Stingarees are found in the Indo-Pacific region, with the greatest diversity off Australia. They are sluggish, bottom-dwelling fish that have been recorded from shallow waters close to shore to deep waters over the upper continental slope. Measuring between long, these rays have oval to diamond-shaped pectoral fin discs and relatively short tails that terminate in leaf-shaped caudal fins, and may also have small dorsal fins and lateral skin folds. Most are smooth-skinned, and some have ornate dorsal color patterns.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- River stingrays or freshwater stingrays are Neotropical freshwater fishes of the Potamotrygonidae family in the order Myliobatiformes, one of the four orders of batoids, cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. River stingrays are found in rivers in South America draining into the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean as far south as the River Plate in Argentina (freshwater stingrays in Africa, Asia and Australia are in another family, Dasyatidae). Each river system has its own endemic stingrays. A single marine genus, \\"Styracura\\", of the tropical West Atlantic and East Pacific are also part of Potamotrygonidae. They are generally brownish, greyish or black, often with a mottled or speckled pattern, have discs ranging from in diameter and venomous tail stingers.

Passage:Witold Wilkosz was born on 14 August 1891 in Kraków to parents Jan, a Polish teacher, and Józefa née Vopalko. He showed a considerable talent for mathematics and languages since early childhood. He passed his final school-leaving Matura exam at the John III Sobieski High School (known in Poland as Gimnasium). He was a friend of fellow mathematician Stefan Banach. Before graduating from high school, he had written an article on semitology for which he was offered a scholarship and membership from Morgenländische Gesselchaft Scienctific Society, which enabled him to study at the University of Beirut. After a few months, he returned to Kraków and took up philology studies at the Jagiellonian University. After two years, he decided to change the course to mathematics, which he studied in Kraków and Turin. He received his doctoral degree on the basis of his dissertation on Lebesgue integrals and started to work as an academic teacher at his alma mater. In 1920, he obtained a habilitation and in 1936 he became a professor. He was arrested on 6 November 1939 by Nazi Germans alongside other prominent intellectuals and professors of Kraków in the infamous Sonderaktion Krakau. However, due to a serious illness, he was soon released together with nine other professors on 9 November. He returned home and began to work as a teacher.

Results of this study indicate that pretreatment of male F344 rats with the calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, or Mg2+ significantly protected against ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions as demonstrated by gross and histopathologic evaluation. Treatment of rats with calcium channel blockers before ethanol or indomethacin administration resulted in a significant decline in the mean number of lesions per glandular stomach, the damaged area of the glandular stomach, and the severity of lesions. Calcium channel blockers also caused a significant decline in the incidence of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions, but had no effect on the incidence of ethanol-induced gastric lesions. These results offer the first evidence that calcium channel blockers may play an important role in the protection against chemically induced gastric lesions and thereby offer insight into the mechanism of gastric ulcer formation. It is speculated that this knowledge may prove important in the development of new and improved therapies for the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers in humans. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract provides numerical information about the key parameters that were measured in the experiment, including the number of lesions per glandular stomach, and the damaged area of the glandular stomach.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) at 5 microM was cardioprotective. However, at a physiologic concentration (0.4 microM) sphingosine as well as S1P was effective in protecting the heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury both when perfused prior to 40 min of ischemia (preconditioning) or when added to reperfusion media following ischemia (postconditioning). Protection by sphingosine and S1P was evidenced with both pre- and post-conditioning by a >75% recovery of left ventricular developed pressure during reperfusion and a decrease in infarct size from 45% of the risk area to less than 8%. When VPC23019, an S1P(1and3)G-protein coupled receptor antagonist, was added to the preconditioning or postconditioning medium along with S1P, it completely blocked S1P-induced protection. However, VPC 23019 did not affect the ability of 0.4 microM sphingosine to either precondition or postcondition hearts. Studies of preconditioning revealed that inhibition of protein kinase C with GF109203X blocked preconditioning by S1P. However, GF109203X did not affect preconditioning by 0.4 microM sphingosine. Likewise, cotreatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmanin blocked preconditioning by S1P but not by sphingosine. By contrast, inhibition of protein kinase G with KT5823 had no effect on S1P preconditioning but completely eliminated preconditioning by sphingosine. Also, the protein kinase A inhibitory peptide 14-22 amide blocked preconditioning by sphingosine but not S1P.

Next time I will upgrade for a few bucks more and get a room with a bath. Upon entering my room, the temperature was warm, but luckily there was a ceiling fan and a window to open for some breeze. The bed was comfortable and a small tv was located at the foot of the bed. My room was nicely decorated and modern looking. Closet was small, but adequate. In my room, the hotel provided a blowdryer, lotion, shampoo and a small bar of soap. The shared baths were very clean and there were bathrooms designated for male and female. The shower room was clean. Not once during my visit did I have to wait. There is a restaurant/bar attached to the hotel called Annabelle's, but I did not get a chance to try it. In the morning, the hotel offers coffee and muffins and there was always a lovely basket of red delicious apples through out the day at the reception area. The hotel's elevator is large and efficient and runs well. A snack machine and a vending machine for water/sodas is located on the bottom floor.The location is wonderful. There are loads and loads and loads of stores to visit and shop til you drop within walking distance of the Mosser. Bloomies, Ross, Old Navy, Westfield Shopping Center within a stones throw of this hotel. There is a Denny's and a Mel's Drive In Restaurant and Starbucks just around the corner too. What I liked best about this hotel is the proximity of it's location to stores, bus routes, BART, Union Sqare, restaurants. It was absolutely perfect.Upon check out, it took no more than 15-20 minutes for the valet to bring my car to the front door for me. I honestly do not have one negative thing to say about this hotel.The Mosser Hotel Rocks and I'll be going back real soon.\\nquestion: Is it a good room?","target":"was nicely","rationale":"The question is asking whether or not the room is good.

He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”.

On July 8, 1865 Brincourt crossed the Nazas River in northern Durango, heading toward Chihuahua. On July 22 Brincourt crossed the banks of Río Florido into Ciudad Jiménez; one day later he arrived at Valle de Allende where he sent Colonel Pyot with a garrison to take control of Hidalgo del Parral. Brincourt continued through Santa Rosalia de Camargo and Santa Cruz de Rosales. President Juárez remained in the state capital until August 5, 1865 when he left for El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Juárez) due to evidence that the French were to attack the city. On the same day, the President named General Manuel Ojinaga the new governor and placed him in charge of all the republican forces. Meanwhile, General Villagran surprised the imperial forces in control of Hidalgo de Parral; after a short two-hour battle, Colonel Pyot was defeated and forced to retreat. At the Battle of Parral, the French lost 55 men to the Republican forces. On August 13, 1865, the French forces with an estimated 2,500 men arrived at the outskirts of Chihuahua City, and on August 15, 1865, General Brincourt defeated the republican forces, taking control of the state capital. Brincourt designated Tomás Zuloaga as Prefect of Chihuahua. Fearing the French would continue their campaign to El Paso del Norte, President Juárez relocated to El Carrizal, a secluded place in the mountains near El Paso del Norte, in August 1865, . It would have been easy for the French forces to continue in pursuit of President Juárez across the border, but they feared altercations with American forces. General François Achille Bazaine ordered the French troops to retreat back to the state of Durango after only reaching a point one days travel north of Chihuahua City.

Antithrombotic treatments are frequently prescribed after TIA and stroke, but there have been no previous studies of microbleeds in TIA. Because microbleeds may predict the hemorrhagic risk of antithrombotic treatments, we studied the prevalence of microbleeds, risk factors, and pathophysiologic mechanisms in patients with ischemic stroke and TIA.', 'One hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients with ischemic stroke or TIA were studied with MRI including T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and gradient-echo MRI sequences. Blinded observers counted microbleeds and graded white matter T2 hyperintensities throughout the brain. TIA patients with previous ischemic stroke were excluded.', 'Sixty-seven percent of patients had ischemic stroke; 33% had TIA. Microbleeds were found in 23% of ischemic stroke patients but only 2% of TIA patients (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in conventional risk factors or the severity of white matter disease on T2 MRI between stroke and TIA patients. Patients with microbleeds were more often hypertensive (81 vs 59%; p = 0.04) and had more severe MRI white matter disease on T2 MRI (p = 0.003).\\nAnswer: Microbleeds are common in ischemic stroke but rare in TIA, an observation not explained by differences in vascular risk factors or severity of white matter disease seen on T2 MRI.

Joe loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on. One day, Joe's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field. His father was worried that Joe would climb on it and hurt himself. Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows. When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near. He knew that climbing on the tractor wouldn't hurt anything, so he did. He climbed on to the seat and sat there. Then, he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor. Joe's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him. Joe heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast. When he did that, he fell off and hurt his arm. Joe was in pain and his father came running to check on him and picked him up and sat him on a bench and asked him why he did that. Joe looked at his father and said, \\"I wanted to be like you.\\" Joe's father gave him a hug and asked him if he wanted to ride with him on the tractor.

Unlike the other revolts, this revolt took place during the British invasion of Manila. On December 14, 1762, Diego Silang declared the independence of Ilocandia, naming the state \\"Free Ilocos\\" and proclaimed Vigan the capital of this newly independent state. The British heard about this revolt in Manila and even asked the help of Silang in fighting the Spanish. However, Silang was killed on May 28, 1763 by Miguel Vicos, a friend of Silang. The Spanish authorities paid for his murder, leading to his death in the arms of his wife, Gabriela. She continued her husband's struggle, earning the title \\"Joan of Arc of the Ilocos\\" because of her many victories in battle. The battles of the Silang revolt are a prime example of the use of divide et impera, since Spanish troops largely used Kapampangan soldiers to fight the Ilocanos. Eventually, the revolt ended with the defeat of the Ilocanos.

Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons.

According to Robert Service, in 1921 Joseph Stalin, then acting Commissar of Nationalities for the Soviet Union, included Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and Karabakh under Azerbaijani control to try to placate Turkey to join the Soviet Union. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would probably have left Karabakh under Armenian control. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established with the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on July 7, 1923. According to Karl R. DeRouen it was created as an enclave so that a narrow strip of land would separate it from Armenia proper. According to Audrey L.

The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building.

When I moved in I set up my own router and modem. I cut the bill from $82 to $55 dollars and had to set up new internet because she was being uncooperative. She claimed that she didnt know who the internet was registered under, even though she was paying for it. \\n\\nSo I told her to call comcast and send back the router when I set up my internet. She said she would and a few days later I texted her about it.

Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. Spectra taken of these distant galaxies showed a red shift in their spectral lines presumably caused by the Doppler effect, thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.","target":"farther","rationale":"As the universe is expanding, galaxies are moving farther away from each other.

His father, Heinrich Ernst Goring (31 October 1839 - 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of South-West Africa (modern-day Namibia). Heinrich had five children from a previous marriage. Goring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859-15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant.\\nContext: During the first year of World War I, Goring served with his infantry regiment in the area of Mulhausen, a garrison town less than 2 km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with rheumatism, a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend Bruno Loerzer convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the Luftstreitkrafte (\\"air combat forces\\") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, Goring flew as Loerzer's observer in Feldflieger Abteilung 25 (FFA 25) - Goring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, Goring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the Crown Prince's Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both Goring and Loerzer with the Iron Cross, first class.  After completing the pilot's training course, Goring was assigned to Jagdstaffel 5. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to Jagdstaffel 26, commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored air victories until May, when he was assigned to command Jagdstaffel 27. Serving with Jastas 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the Zaehring Lion with swords, the Friedrich Order, the House Order of Hohenzollern with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted Pour le Merite. According to Hermann Dahlmann, who knew both men, Goring had Loerzer lobby for the award. He finished the war with 22 victories. A thorough post-war examination of Allied loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.  On 7 July 1918, following the death of Wilhelm Reinhard, successor to Manfred von Richthofen, Goring was made commander of the famed \\"Flying Circus\\", Jagdgeschwader 1. His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.  In the last days of the war, Goring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to Tellancourt airdrome, then to Darmstadt. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.  Like many other German veterans, Goring was a proponent of the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the Republicans, who had overthrown the German monarchy.\\nQuestion: Where was Hermann Goring first was enlisted as a soldier?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"the area of Mulhausen,","rationale":"Hermann Goring was first enlisted as a soldier in the area of Mulhausen, which is indicated by this context."},{"source":"Article: Both Roger Williams and John Clarke, his compatriot and coworker for religious freedom, are variously credited as founding the earliest Baptist church in North America.

One of the most prominent bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 Tone ska revival, they continue to perform with six of the seven members of their classic line-up. Madness achieved most of their success in the early to mid-1980s.

They later recruited John Hasler on drums and Cathal Smyth (better known as Chas Smash) on bass guitar. Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist Dikron Tulane.  This six-piece line-up lasted until part way through 1977, when Graham McPherson (better known as Suggs) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's garden. Dikron went on to be an actor under the name Dikran Tulaine. Smyth, who left after an argument with Barson, was replaced by Gavin Rodgers, Barson's girlfriend's brother. McPherson was kicked out of the band for too often choosing to watch Chelsea instead of rehearsing. Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his saxophone playing.  By 1978, the band had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed). Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson. Drummer Daniel Woodgate (Woody) and bass player Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers, respectively.

Passage 1:The Duchy of Prussia was a duchy in the eastern part of Prussia from 1525–1701. In 1525 during the Protestant Reformation, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Hohenzollern, secularized the Prussian State of the Teutonic Order, becoming Albert, Duke in Prussia. His duchy, which had its capital in Königsberg (Kaliningrad), was established as a fief of the Crown of Poland, as had been Teutonic Prussia since the Second Peace of Thorn in October 1466. This treaty had ended the War of the Cities or Thirteen Years' War and provided for the Order's cession of its rights over the western half of its territories to the Polish crown, which became the province of Royal Prussia, while the remaining part of the Order's land became a fief of the Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569). In the 17th century King John II Casimir of Poland submitted Frederick William to regain Prussian suzerainty in return for supporting Poland against Sweden. On July 29, 1657, they signed the Treaty of Wehlau in Wehlau (Polish: Welawa; now Znamensk), whereby Frederick William renounced a previous Swedish-Prussian alliance and John Casimir recognised Frederick William's full sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia. Full sovereignty was a necessary prerequisite for upgrading the Duchy to Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.\\n Passage 2:The Meimad movement was founded on 1 June 1988 by Rabbi Yehuda Amital, and included former National Religious Party Knesset member Yehuda Ben-Meir.

Eleven years later, a political arm was established, and joined the One Israel alliance that won the Knesset elections that year. Meimad received one seat, taken by Michael Melchior. It gained a second when Yehuda Gilad replaced Maxim Levy in 2002. Tova Ilan also represented Meimad in the Knesset for a brief spell in 2006, after several other Labour MKs resigned.

The mission went perfectly without incident--at least that's what every one believed.\\nHowever, that view has changed since February 22, after NASA released a digital recording of strange music heard by the space travelers.Then as they were re-entering the zone where they could communicate with ground control.One of the astronauts asked if they should report it.In response, Stafford expressed his doubts if anyone would even believe them.But they needn't have worried.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America.

These three sagas were written c. 1220-1230, and in using them as historical sources, it has to be remembered that they were thus written a fair amount of time after the events they describe. However, they are likely to have been based on earlier works, in particular the saga Hryggjarstykki, written c. 1150, which is lost to us, but was available to the authors of the three aforementioned sagas. Ágrip af Noregs konunga sögum also describes the civil war era, but has only been preserved up to the events of c. 1136. The period 1177 to 1240  is treated in detail in contemporaneous sagas: Sverris saga  the Bagler sagas  and Håkon Håkonsson's saga .

The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than $500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people. \\n\\nQuestion: What will IBM be producing in upstate NY?\\nI think \\"Smartphone chips\\" is a valid answer.

In small populations, demographic stochasticity will decrease the population growth rate, causing an effect similar to the Allee effect, which will increase the risk of population extinction. Whether or not demographic stochasticity can be considered a part of Allee effect is somewhat contentious however. The most current definition of Allee effect considers the correlation between population density and mean individual fitness. Therefore, random variation resulting from birth and death events would not be considered part of Allee effect as the increased risk of extinction is not a consequence of the changing fates of individuals within the population.Meanwhile, when demographic stochasticity results in fluctuations of sex ratios, it arguably reduces the mean individual fitness as population declines. For example, a fluctuation in small population that causes a scarcity in one sex would in turn limit the access of mates for the opposite sex, decreasing the fitness of the individuals within the population. This type of Allee effect will likely be more prevalent in monogamous species than polygynous species.","target":"Plano","rationale":"Demographic stochasticity is an effect that can result in a decrease of population growth rate and increase the risk of extinction.

The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building.

But his greatest success wasThe Great Gatsby, published in 1925, which quickly brought him praise from the literary world. Yet it failed to give him the needed financial security.

Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries.

The character first appeared in 1930. The books are ghostwritten by a number of authors and published under the collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Over the decades, the character evolved in response to changes in US culture and tastes. The books were extensively revised and shortened, beginning in 1959, in part to lower printing costs and to eliminate racist stereotypes, with arguable success. In the revision process, the heroine's original character was changed to be less assertive and more feminine. In the 1980s, an older and more professional Nancy emerged in a new series, \\"The Nancy Drew Files\\", that included romantic subplots for the sleuth. The original \\"Nancy Drew Mystery Stories\\" series started in 1930, and ended in 2004. Launched that same year, the \\"Girl Detective\\" series features Nancy driving a hybrid electric vehicle and using a cell phone. In 2013, the \\"Girl Detective\\" series ended, and a new current series called \\"Nancy Drew Diaries\\" was launched. Illustrations of the character evolved over time to reflect contemporary styles. The character proves continuously popular worldwide: at least 80 million copies of the books have been sold, and the books have been translated into over 45 languages.

There are many variables that can determine how long it takes to close on an FHA loan. Underwriting is one of the biggest variables. Once you’ve found a home and signed a contract with the seller, the rest of the lending process might take two or three weeks on the short end, or two to three months on the long end. There are many variables and several different people involved. I work with a lot of HUD homes and closings. HUD requires the home to be closed within 45 days. If you are paying cash you can close much faster. Are you closing with the HUD attorney? Fearnley, Calif, & Price? If so they should be able to clear title quickly because they already have all the information. Most federally related mortgage loans can close within 30 days. Special first-time home buyer programs, particularly those involving help with the buyer's down payment, might take 35 to 45 days to close. These special loans typically require approval from two underwriting processes. HUD, though, understands that even pre-approved winning bidders on its homes will need time to close. Additionally, HUD also needs time to write up and send contracts to the real estate brokers of winning home bidders. Due to the time needed by all involved parties, HUD generally allows winning home bidders with mortgages up to 45 days to close. HUD Preparation Time It may take HUD from two to five days to notify bidders on its homes that they've won their bids. Answer: Read our section on how to buy a HUD home. Then look at the listings of HUD homes available. If you find a home that interests you, you'll need to contact a HUD-approved real estate broker (most brokers are HUD-approved), who can submit a bid for you. Successful bids are posted right on the page for your state. For more information, you may also contact our FHA Resource Center by email at answers@hud.gov or by phone at (800) CALLFHA. if a home is a REO, how long does it usually take to close if you have a letter of guarantee funds estimate closing time on reo (0) | asked by: Terry Davenport | share | 54 months ago | Report December 30, 2010 08:15 AM. 1  This is a question that I am often asked. 2  For the purpose of this article, let’s talk about a HUD home that has just been listed, and that the purchaser is an owner occupant. 3  No bids are opened for the first 10 days that the property is listed. So if you make a bid on the first day of the listing period, you will have to wait at least 10 days for an acceptance. In some cases, it it taking an additional 2-5 days for the winning bidder to be notified. Once notified, the selling agent then has only 2 days to get the contract delivered to the HUD asset manager. www.hud.com is your single best resource for HUD homes nationally. HUD also advertises to the general public through over a dozen asset management and marketing (M&M) companies that are contracted by HUD to maintain and sell its properties. You may check the HUD Web site for the names of M&M Contractors who list the properties by posting them on their respective Web sites. Just about anyone can buy a house for sale by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). As long as you have the cash or can qualify for a mortgage loan, you can submit a bid through a HUD-approved real estate broker. HUD homes are first available only to home buyers who plan to live in the house.

Mariner 9 was launched toward Mars on May 30, 1971 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and reached the planet on November 14 of the same year, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet  only narrowly beating the Soviets' Mars 2 and Mars 3, which both arrived within a month. After months of dust storms it managed to send back clear pictures of the surface.\\n\\n- Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli (14 March 1835  4 July 1910) was an Italian astronomer and science historian.\\n\\n- Margaritifer Terra is an ancient, heavily cratered region of Mars. It is centered just south of the Martian equator at and covers 2600 km at its widest extent. The area reveals \\"chaos terrain\\", outflow channels, and alluvial plains that are indicative of massive flooding. Wind erosion patterns are also in evidence. A region within the terra shows some of the highest valley network densities on the planet. Ares Vallis is another notable feature, where the flood and flow patterns are in evidence; it was the landing site of \\"Mars 6\\" and NASA's \\"Mars Pathfinder\\". It is also one of several proposed landing sites for the Mars 2020 Rover.\\n\\n- A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\".\\n\\n- The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.\\nAbout three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.\\n\\n- A rift valley is a linear-shaped lowland between several highlands or mountain ranges created by the action of a geologic rift or fault. A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary, a crustal extension, a spreading apart of the surface, which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion. When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart, a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks, forming a graben. The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new. That feature is the beginning of the rift valley, but as the process continues, the valley widens, until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area. One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift. On Earth, rifts can occur at all elevations, from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust. They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys, which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically.\\n\\n- Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.\\n\\n- An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.\\n\\n- Xanthe Terra is a large area on Mars, centered just north of the Martian equator. Its coordinates are and it covers 2465 km at its broadest extent. Its name means \\"golden-yellow land.\\" It is in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle, and the Oxia Palus quadrangle.\\nImages from Mars Express, Mars Global Surveyor, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed ancient river valleys and deltas. The deltas show many thin layers just as deltas on Earth. Scientists speculate that features in Xanthe Terra show evidence of precipitation on early Mars.\\n\\n- Iani Chaos is a region of chaos terrain at the south end of the outflow channel Ares Vallis, of the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle (MC-19) region of the planet Mars, centered at approximately ~342°E, 2°S. This is the source region of Ares Vallis. The chaotic terrain is widely believed to have formed via the removal of subsurface water or ice, resulting in flooding at the surface, and the formation of Ares Vallis. Within Iani Chaos, deposited stratigraphically above the chaotic terrain, are smooth, low-slope, intermediate-to-light-toned deposits that are rich in a hydrated mineral that is most likely gypsum as well as hematite.\\n\\n- Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.\\n\\n- Mars Pathfinder (MESUR Pathfinder) is an American robotic spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars in 1997. It consisted of a lander, renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station, and a lightweight (10.6 kg/23 lb) wheeled robotic Mars rover named \\"Sojourner\\", which became the first rover to operate outside \\nthe Earth-Moon system.\\n\\n- The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. \\n\\n- An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.\\n\\n- Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide typically containing traces of iron, titanium, vanadium and chromium. It is a rock-forming mineral. It is a naturally transparent material, but can have different colors when impurities are present. Transparent specimens are used as gems, called \\"ruby\\" if red and \\"padparadscha\\" if pink-orange. All other colors are called \\"sapphire\\", e.g., \\"green sapphire\\" for a green specimen.\\n\\n- Valles Marineris (Latin for \\"Mariner Valleys\\", named after the \\"Mariner 9\\" Mars orbiter of 197172 which discovered it) is a system of canyons that runs along the Martian surface east of the Tharsis region. At more than long, wide and up to deep, Valles Marineris is one of the largest canyons of the Solar System, surpassed in length only by the rift valleys of Earth.\\n\\n- Ares Vallis is an outflow channel on Mars, named after the Greek name for Mars: Ares, the god of war; it appears to have been carved by fluids, perhaps water. The valley 'flows' northwest out of the hilly Margaritifer Terra, where the Iani Chaos depression long and wide) is connected to the beginning of Ares Vallis by a wide transition zone centered on 342.5° East (17.5 West) and 3° North. It then continues through the ancient Xanthe Terra highlands, and ends in a delta-like region of Chryse Planitia. Ares Vallis was the landing site of NASA's \\"Mars Pathfinder\\" spacecraft, which studied a region of the valley near the border with Chryse in 1997.\\n\\n- Meteor Crater is a meteorite impact crater approximately east of Flagstaff and west of Winslow in the northern Arizona desert of the United States. Because the United States Board on Geographic Names commonly recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office, the feature acquired the name of \\"Meteor Crater\\" from the nearby post office named Meteor. The site was formerly known as the Canyon Diablo Crater and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite. Scientists refer to the crater as Barringer Crater in honor of Daniel Barringer, who was first to suggest that it was produced by meteorite impact. The crater is privately owned by the Barringer family through their Barringer Crater Company, which proclaims it to be the \\"best preserved meteorite crater on Earth\\".\\n\\n- Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.\\n\\n- Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (FeO), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above .\\n\\n- Aram Chaos , centered at 2.6 ° N , 21.5 ° W , comprises a heavily eroded impact crater on the planet Mars . It lies at the eastern end of the large canyon Valles Marineris and close to Ares Vallis . Various geological processes have reduced it to a circular area of chaotic terrain . Aram Chaos takes its name from Aram , one of the classical albedo features observed by Giovanni Schiaparelli , who named it after the Biblical land of Aram . Spectroscopic observation from orbit indicates the presence of the mineral hematite , likely a signature of a once aqueous environment . Aram Chaos measures about 280 kilometers ( 170 mi ) across , and lies in a region called Margaritifer Terra , where many water - carved channels show that floods poured out of the highlands onto the northern lowlands ages ago . The Thermal Emission Imaging System ( THEMIS ) on the orbiter Mars Odyssey found gray crystalline hematite on the floor of Aram . CRISM , the spectroscope on the MRO , found hyrdrated sulfates , jarosite , and hematite . Hematite is an iron - oxide mineral that can precipitate when ground water circulates through iron - rich rocks , whether at normal temperatures or in hot springs . The floor of Aram contains huge blocks of collapsed , or chaotic , terrain that formed when water or ice was catastrophically removed . Elsewhere on Mars , the release of groundwater produced massive floods that eroded the large channels seen in Ares Vallis and similar outflow valleys . In Aram Chaos , however , the released water stayed mostly within the crater 's ramparts , eroding only a small , shallow outlet channel in the eastern wall . Several minerals including hematite sulfate minerals , and water - altered silicates in Aram suggests that a lake probably once existed within the crater . Because forming hematite requires liquid water , which could not long exist without a thick atmosphere , Mars must have had a much thicker atmosphere at some time in the past .\\n\\n- Chryse Planitia (Greek, \\"\\"Golden Plain\\"\\") is a smooth circular plain in the northern equatorial region of Mars close to the Tharsis region to the west, centered at . Chryse Planitia lies partially in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, partially in the Oxia Palus quadrangle, partially in the Mare Acidalium quadrangle. It is 1600 km or 994 mi in diameter and with a floor 2.5 km below the average planetary surface altitude, and is thought to be an ancient impact basin; it has several features in common with lunar maria, such as wrinkle ridges. The density of impact craters in the range is close to half the average for lunar maria.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'location' with 'oxia palus quadrangle'.","target":"aram chaos","rationale":"Here's the rationale: \\"aram chaos\\".\\n\\"\\"Located in Oxia Palus quadrangle.\\""},{"source":"Given the Target and Argument texts detect the stance that the argument has towards the topic.

Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).\\n\\nTitle:","target":"Cotton","rationale":"The article describes the history of cotton, from its cultivation and processing to its eventual use in making textiles.

According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.

When the child regurgitates after meals and swallows it again without nausea or retching. It is a disorder that occurs mainly in children under 3 years of age, although it also occurs in older children, but in these cases it has been associated with mental retardation, autism or cerebral palsy. In most cases its onset begins shortly after birth (<12 hours) and symptoms appear at about 2 weeks of life. The main symptom is the regurgitation (more than once a day) after feeding for more than 1 month without any other apparent cause such as a medical problem or feeding difficulty. Although rumination can be very distressing for parents, this condition rarely causes significant health problems because the food comes out before being digested so there are no weight loss issues either. Rumination generally improves spontaneously between 6-12 months of age when children begin to develop voluntary control over their swallowing patterns; however, some cases may persist until 18 months old.\\""},{"source":"Context: Hoping to build on their win in Oakland, the Browns flew to Bank of America Stadium for a Week 5 match-up with the Carolina Panthers.

Opportunities for therapeutic intervention were limited to only a few applications such as herpesvirus infections, infl uenza, and HIV/AIDS; hence, once a bacterial or fungal infection was excluded, clinicians were limited to providing supportive care for what was presumed to be a viral syndrome. Public health organizations tracked the incidence of viral infections and the development of resistance to the few antiviral drugs in use and provided input to governments and the pharmaceutical industry regarding selection of vaccine targets. More recently, interest in viral diagnostics has burgeoned with the advent of new tools for detection and discovery, global recognition of pandemic risk, high-throughput drug screening, rational drug design, and immunotherapeutics. An additional impetus has been the implication of viruses in chronic illnesses not previously attributed to infection.

These effects can be permanent and, in some cases, life-threatening. The long-term effects of Valium include: Memory loss. Hallucinations. Difficulty breathing. Slowed pulse. Coma. Heart attack. The half-life of Valium is fairly long – it can take 20 hours or more for just half of the medication to be eliminated from your system. However, just because it’s not completely eliminated after 20 hours doesn’t mean it’s still effective. Valium Long-Term Effects Heavy use of Valium over an extended period of time can have powerful effects on the brain and body. These effects can be permanent and, in some cases, life-threatening. So you would actually have to account for the elimination of N-desmethyldiazepam. It takes 5.5 x elimination half lives (hours) for a medicine to be cleared from your system, therefore Valium or it's active metabolite will be in your system for 550 hours (5.5 x 100hrs) i.e. approximately 23 days. Both temazepam and oxazepam have a modest half-life of 8-9 hours. Due to the long half-life of diazepam it works for a significant period of time. Most of the effects last about 6-8 hours, after that time Valium and its active metabolites continue to exert very subtle and very mild effects that are often unnoticed. Valium affects the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, helping to slow down and stop abnormal brain activity. This results in a calming effect, and sometimes feelings of euphoria. It helps reduce anxiety, cause sleepiness, relax muscles, stop seizures, and more. Depends on the strength. A 10mg will kick in around 30 to 60 minutes after ingesting and last about 4-6 hrs. It stays in your system for over 100+ hours, although the effects …are gone after 6 hrs. It really took the edge off my fear (40 min in the machine) but there is not easy way to tell when it actually wears off. about 2 hours after i took it a had a nap which turned out to be a pretty deep 2 hour affair :-) when i got up i would say for sure there was nothing left of the Valium... How long a drug stays in your system depends mainly on it's elimination half life. For Valium (diazepam) the initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48 hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is, on average, 100 hours. Side Effects. When used properly, Valium does not produce the same effects as it does when abused/misused. Valium has side effects with proper use, but these are temporary and should go away after a few standard doses. The Dangers of Valium For 13 years, Valium was the most prescribed drug in America.

We had agreed that I would meet her at the corner when she returned and I finished my job.\\nAt four o'clock I rushed to the corner so I wouldn't be late for meeting Karen. Just as I arrived at the corner, I saw Karen crossing the street. In a second it happened. I saw Karen's body fly up in the sky. A car had hit her!\\nKaren was on life support for a week before it was decided that they would allow her to go in peace.

One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste.

Although his existence remains unclear and no writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day. Many of the tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics.\\n\\nThe name of Aesop is as widely known as any that has come down from Graeco-Roman antiquity [yet] it is far from certain whether a historical Aesop ever existed ... in the latter part of the fifth century something like a coherent Aesop legend appears, and Samos seems to be its home.  The earliest Greek sources, including Aristotle, indicate that Aesop was born around 620 BCE in Thrace at a site on the Black Sea coast which would later become the city Mesembria. A number of later writers from the Roman imperial period (including Phaedrus, who adapted the fables into Latin) say that he was born in Phrygia. The 3rd-century poet Callimachus called him \\"Aesop of Sardis,\\" and the later writer Maximus of Tyre called him \\"the sage of Lydia.\\"  From Aristotle and Herodotus we learn that Aesop was a slave in Samos and that his masters were first a man named Xanthus and then a man named Iadmon; that he must eventually have been freed, because he argued as an advocate for a wealthy Samian; and that he met his end in the city of Delphi. Plutarch tells us that Aesop had come to Delphi on a diplomatic mission from King Croesus of Lydia, that he insulted the Delphians, was sentenced to death on a trumped-up charge of temple theft, and was thrown from a cliff (after which the Delphians suffered pestilence and famine). Before this fatal episode, Aesop met with Periander of Corinth, where Plutarch has him dining with the Seven Sages of Greece, sitting beside his friend Solon, whom he had met in Sardis. (Leslie Kurke suggests that Aesop himself \\"was a popular contender for inclusion\\" in the list of Seven Sages.)  Problems of chronological reconciliation dating the death of Aesop and the reign of Croesus led the Aesop scholar (and compiler of the Perry Index) Ben Edwin Perry in 1965 to conclude that \\"everything in the ancient testimony about Aesop that pertains to his associations with either Croesus or with any of the so-called Seven Wise Men of Greece must be reckoned as literary fiction,\\" and Perry likewise dismissed Aesop's death in Delphi as legendary; but subsequent research has established that a possible diplomatic mission for Croesus and a visit to Periander \\"are consistent with the year of Aesop's death.\\" Still problematic is the story by Phaedrus which has Aesop in Athens, telling the fable of the frogs who asked for a king, during the reign of Peisistratos, which occurred decades after the presumed date of Aesop's death.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did he do?","target":"From Aristotle and Herodotus we learn that Aesop was a slave in Samos and that his masters were first a man named Xanthus and then a man named Iadmon;","rationale":"The first part of the quote states that Aesop was a slave and names his masters.

As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful action. He established the long-term political prominence of the Long family. A Democrat and an outspoken populist, Long denounced the wealthy elites and the banks.\\n\\nOnce in office as governor on May 21, 1928, Long moved quickly to consolidate his power, firing hundreds of opponents in the state bureaucracy, at all ranks from cabinet-level heads of departments and board members to rank-and-file civil servants and state road workers. Like previous governors, he filled the vacancies with patronage appointments from his own network of political supporters. Every state employee who depended on Long for a job was expected to pay a portion of his or her salary at election time directly into Long's political war-chest, which raised $50,000 to $75,000 (equivalent to about $700,000 to $1,000,000 in 2013 dollars) each election cycle. The funds were kept in a famous locked \\"deduct box\\" to be used at Long's discretion for political and personal purposes. The American historian David Kennedy wrote that the extremely authoritarian regime Long established in Louisiana was \\"... the closest thing to a dictatorship that America has ever known\\".  Once his control over the state's political apparatus was strengthened, Long pushed a number of bills through the 1929 session of the Louisiana State Legislature to fulfill campaign promises. These included a free textbook program for schoolchildren, an idea advanced by John Sparks Patton, the Claiborne Parish school superintendent, and the Long confidant, Representative Harley Bozeman of Winnfield. Long also supported night courses for adult literacy (which taught 100,000 adults to read by the end of his term), and a supply of cheap natural gas for the city of New Orleans.  Long began an unprecedented public works program, building roads, bridges, hospitals, and educational institutions. Huey P. Long's reign of legislation brought textbooks, a highway, natural gas heating to New Orleans, and buildings still standing at LSU. His bills met opposition from many legislators, wealthy citizens, and the media, but Long used aggressive tactics to ensure passage of the legislation he favored. He would show up unannounced on the floor of both the House and Senate or in House committees, corralling reluctant representatives and state senators and bullying opponents. These tactics were unprecedented, but they resulted in the passage of most of Long's legislative agenda. By delivering on his campaign promises, Long achieved hero status among the state's rural poor population.  When Long secured passage of his free textbook program, the school board of Caddo Parish, home of conservative Shreveport, sued to prevent the books from being distributed, saying it would not accept \\"charity\\" from the state. Long responded by withholding authorization for locating an Army Air Corps base nearby until the parish accepted the books.  In the 1930 legislative session, Long proposed another major road-building initiative as well as the construction of a new capitol building in Baton Rouge. The State Legislature defeated the bond issue necessary to build the roads, and his other initiatives failed as well.  Long responded by suddenly announcing his intention to run for the U.S. Senate in the Democratic primary of September 9, 1930. He portrayed his campaign as a referendum on his programs: if he won he would take it as a sign that the public supported his programs over the opposition of the legislature, and if he lost he promised to resign. Long defeated incumbent Senator Joseph E. Ransdell, an Alexandria native from Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish, by 149,640 (57.3 percent) to 111,451 (42.7 percent).  Although his Senate term began on March 4, 1931, Long completed most of his four-year term as governor, which did not end until May 1932. He declared that leaving the seat vacant for so long would not hurt Louisiana; \\"with Ransdell as Senator, the seat was vacant anyway.\\" By not leaving the governor's mansion until January 25, 1932, Long prevented Lieutenant Governor Paul N. Cyr, a former ally, from succeeding to the office. A dentist and geologist from Jeanerette in Iberia Parish, Cyr had subsequently broken with Long and been threatening to roll back his reforms if he succeeded to the governorship. In his autobiography, Long recalled:  On another occasion the greatest publicity was given to a charge made by Lieutenant Governor Cyr that I had performed a swindle worse than that of Teapot Dome in the execution of an oil lease ... The oil lease in question had been made by Governor Parker, and no act had been taken by me, except to permit the holder to enter into a drilling contract. Our reply was practically buried by most of the newspapers.  Long continued to maintain effective control of Louisiana while he was a senator, blurring the boundary between federal and state politics. Though he had no constitutional authority to do so, Long continued to draft and press bills through the Louisiana State Legislature, which remained in the hands of his allies. He made frequent trips to Baton Rouge to pressure the Legislature into enacting his legislation. The program included new consumer taxes, elimination of the poll tax, a homestead tax exemption, and increases in the number of state employees. While physically in Louisiana, Long customarily stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, where he was fond of the Sazerac Bar (see Peychaud's Bitters). According to Thomas M. Mahne in the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Long had a personal interest in seeing to the quick construction of Airline Highway (US 61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans as the new road cut 40 miles from the trip.  Long's loyal lieutenant, Governor Oscar K. Allen, dutifully enacted Long's policies. Long berated the governor in public and took over the governor's office in the State Capitol when visiting Baton Rouge. On occasion, he even entered the legislative chambers, going so far as to sit on representatives' and senators' desks and sternly lecture them on his positions. He also retaliated against those who voted against him and used patronage and state funding (especially highways) to maneuver Louisiana toward what opponents called a Long \\"dictatorship\\". Having broken a second time after earlier reconciliation with the Old Regulars and Mayor Walmsley in the fall of 1933, Long inserted himself into the New Orleans mayoral election of 1934. A second rift hence developed with the city government that lasted even until after Long's assassination.  In 1934, Long and James A. Noe, an independent oilman and member of the Louisiana Senate from Ouachita Parish, formed the controversial Win or Lose Oil Company. The firm was established to obtain leases on state-owned lands so that its directors might collect bonuses and sublease the mineral rights to the major oil companies. Although ruled legal, these activities were done in secret, and the stockholders were unknown to the public. Long made a profit on the bonuses and the resale of those state leases and used the funds primarily for political purposes.  By 1934, Long began a reorganization of the state government that reduced the authority of local governments in anti-Long strongholds New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Alexandria. It further gave the governor the power to appoint all state employees. Long passed what he called \\"a tax on lying\\" and a 2 percent tax on newspaper advertising revenue. He created the Bureau of Criminal Identification, a special force of plainclothes police answerable only to the governor. He also had the legislature enact the same tax on refined oil that in 1929 had nearly led to his impeachment, which he used as a bargaining chip to promote oil drilling in Louisiana. After Standard Oil agreed that 80 percent of the oil sent to its refineries would be drilled in Louisiana, Long's government refunded most of these tax revenues.

The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as Alexander Graham Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845-70) and Edward Charles Bell (1848-67), both of whom would die of tuberculosis. His father was Professor Alexander Melville Bell, a phonetician, and his mother was Eliza Grace (nee Symonds).\\n\\nHis father encouraged Bell's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique automaton developed by Sir Charles Wheatstone based on the earlier work of Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen. The rudimentary \\"mechanical man\\" simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a \\"big prize\\" if they were successful. While his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could \\"speak\\", albeit only a few words. The boys would carefully adjust the \\"lips\\" and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe, a very recognizable \\"Mama\\" ensued, to the delight of neighbours who came to see the Bell invention.  Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye Terrier, \\"Trouve\\". After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding \\"Ow ah oo ga ma ma\\". With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate \\"How are you, grandma?\\" Indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a \\"talking dog\\". These initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using tuning forks to explore resonance.  At age 19, Bell wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist Alexander Ellis, a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in Pygmalion). Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of Hermann von Helmholtz's work, The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music.  Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork \\"contraption\\", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: \\"Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech.\\" He also later remarked: \\"I thought that Helmholtz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity.

A detachment of 10th Cavalry would fight one of their last battles of the Apache Wars north of Globe at the Salt River during an expedition on 7 March 1890. After the battle Sergeant William McBryar, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the pursuit of the Apache warriors. After twenty years of service on posts in the southwest, the regiment, now under the command of Colonel John K.

Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or \\"desensitization\\" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine.","target":"Expression of fibrinogen receptors during activation and subsequent desensitization of human platelets by epinephrine","rationale":"The title should convey the key focus of the paper, which is to examine the effect of epinephrine on fibrinogen receptor expression and platelet aggregation.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

Passage 1:After the Nazis came to power, he emigrated to Switzerland in 1933 and to the United States later. He began his studies in Zurich and worked part-time as a house teacher. Meanwhile, he wrote articles and book reviews for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, using several pseudonyms because of prohibition of work. He earned his PhD and taught French and German Literature at various universities, including Princeton University and University of Wisconsin-Madison. During a journey to Europe, Vordtriede was surprised by the outbreak of the Second World War and interned as an Enemy alien in occupied France. By interventions, he became free months later and was allowed to go back to America. He met his mother in New York City late in 1941, who also emigrated to the USA. He received the American citizenship in 1946 and became a Guggenheim Fellow in 1957. His sister Fränze emigrated in 1947 and went to Philadelphia.\\n Passage 2:Johann Diederich Gries was born into a prosperous Hamburg family, the fourth of his parents' seven recorded sons. Franz Lorenz Gries (1731-1803), his father, was a merchant and city senator. His mother Johanna also came from a mercantile background. He undertook an apprenticeship in business with a Hamburg wholesale merchant for three years between 1793 and 1795 which, he let it be known, was a miserable thing to have to do. After his elder brother Ludwig had intervened with their father on his behalf he was permitted to embark on a period of study in Law, enrolling at the University of Jena in October 1795. At Jena his naturally affability, his abundance of inoffensive humour and his exceptional talent as a piano player all combined to gain him ready access to the homes and social circles of the professors. He also acquired an extensive network of lifelong friend among his student contemporaries, such as Johann Georg Rist, Johann Friedrich Herbart, , also including a couple of years later Georg Arnold Heise, August Ludwig Hülsen and . At the home of the anatomist Justus Christian Loder he got to know Goethe and Schiller, Herder and Fichte. It was nevertheless striking that while his literary awareness and social circle developed rapidly, he approached his studies in jurisprudence with a marked absence of diligence. Early in 1797 he returned to Hamburg for a visit during which he renewed his friendship with Johann Albert Heinrich Reimarus and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi. That summer he accompanied Caroline Schlegel and her daughter to Dresden where Schlegel was staying. That also gave him the opportunity to meet Schelling by whom he was much impressed. Around this time he also visited Freiberg where he was warmly received by . \\n Passage 3:After the political changes in 2000, Croatian cinema proved it could work in a completely free environment for the first time. As a result, at the beginning of this decade Croatian cinema flourishes again, and many critics write about \\"third golden era\\" (after the 1950s and 1960s). One of the most popular authors in the contemporary Croatian cinema is Vinko Brešan whose comedies Kako je počeo rat na mom otoku (How the War Started on My Island, 1997), and Maršal (Marshal Tito's Spirit, 1999) mix grotesque humor and political provocation. Brešan's war drama Svjedoci (Witnesses, based on a novel by Jurica Pavičić) was the first feature film from countries of former Yugoslavia which discussed the war crimes committed by \\"our guys\\", not the enemy. Film was screened in competition at the Berlin Film Festival in 2003. A Wonderful Night in Split (Ta divna splitska noć, 2004) by Arsen A.

Following his work as vocalist on Steve Vai's 1993 album Sex & Religion and its 1994 tour, Townsend believed he had been a \\"musical whore\\", spending \\"the first five years of [his] career working at the behest of other people\\". During a brief stint as touring guitarist for The Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from an A&R representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as \\"just noise\\". He faced further rejection by Relativity Records, the label behind Vai's Sex & Religion, who saw no commercial appeal in his music. Century Media Records subsequently contacted the musician, offering him a contract to \\"make us some extreme albums\\". Townsend agreed to a five-album deal with the record label.Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, under the moniker Strapping Young Lad.

Though it varies from person to person, on an average, 3 minutes is the maximum time where the person can stay alive without oxygen. Yoga and meditation experts may hold breath for longer than this, but these are very rare examples. In an absence of oxygen, brain cells begin to die and this effect is irreversible! The brain cannot go without oxygen for more than ten minutes. If oxygen is not able to get to the brain before this, then there is a possibility of irreversible brain damage. The brain cannot go without oxygen for more than ten minutes. If oxygen is not able to get to the brain before this, then there is a possibility of irreversible brain damage. How long can someone go without oxygen before there is brain damage ? If someone has been without oxygen for 15 minutes is there any hope that they can wake from a coma without any brain damage. If there is brain damage, is it always severe or does it depend on each patient ? Questions and Answers About Transplantation and Donation. Below are some frequently asked questions about brain death, how organ donation works, the need for donors, organ failure, and transplantation. 1. What do medical personnel do to save the life of a person with a head injury? 2. What kinds of injuries may lead to brain death? 3. How long can the brain go without oxygen before serious damage occurs? 4. What happens when your brain is injured? 5. What can be done if your brain is injured? 6. What is brain death? Doesn't the person's heart have to stop for them to be dead? 7. How can you tell if someone is brain dead? 8. What does a brain dead person look like? 9. If the person is brain dead how can the heart still be beating? 10. 3. How long can the brain go without oxygen before serious damage occurs? After five to ten minutes of not breathing, you are likely to develop serious and possibly irreversible brain damage. The one exception is when a younger person stops breathing and also becomes very cold at the same time. This can occur when a child is suddenly plunged into very cold water and drowns. In this situation, survival after more than 30 minutes has been known to occur. Return to the list of Frequently Asked Questions >> So expect a minute at most before permanent brain damage, and maybe 3 minutes at max before total death. And if you want to experience having overly oxygen-rich blood, take a few deep, meditative breaths. Humans are aerobic creatures, meaning we require oxygen to release energy and exist. Without oxygen, our cells wouldn’t be able to release the energy in the food we eat, and we would die. We take in oxygen through respiration — we move air in and out of the lungs, and blood takes oxygen to the cells of the body. Carbon dioxide, a waste product in our bodies, is moved out of the body by the same system. Breathing has always been synonymous with life. Our speech is permeated with idioms and phrases relying on the idea that taking a breath is the surest sign of vitality, and we constantly compare things we need to our body’s ultimate necessity: oxygen. Under relatively normal circumstances, we start struggling after a few minutes without oxygen. Without being able to convert energy and use it up, cells start to die. This happens throughout the entire body, but it is the brain’s lack of oxygen that is most urgent. “The brain is a highly metabolically active organ,” Tishler said. “It needs oxygen to generate the energy to function. Without the energy (without oxygen) it dies.” The brain normally takes up about 20 percent of the body’s oxygen. If it doesn’t get what it needs, cells begin dying off, putting a person at risk of permanent brain damage. If a person suffocates, or suffers another type of involuntary oxygen deprivation, they’ll ultimately suffer brain death: the utter, irreversible loss of brain function. It’s a pretty unavoidable succession of events. Between 30-180 seconds of oxygen deprivation, you may lose consciousness. At the one-minute mark, brain cells begin dying. At three minutes, neurons suffer more extensive damage, and lasting brain damage becomes more likely. At five minutes, death becomes imminent. At 10 minutes, even if the brain remains alive, a coma and lasting brain damage are almost inevitable. At 15 minutes, survival becomes nearly impossible. There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some training routines help the body make more efficient use of oxygen, enabling the brain to go longer periods without this vital element. Free divers routinely train to go long periods without oxygen, and the current record holder held his breath for 22 minutes without sustaining brain damage!

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers.\\nIf you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions.\\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\\nCentral to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

The author then refers back to his experience working with Professor Sir John Curtice who he worked with for several years and after 30 years in the business already knows all these people by name.

POST : Last night we had a party, some of my work friends, some of my fiancées work friends and my best buddy drove a few cousins and friends out here for the night. \\n\\nLast night was a blast. We had video games hooked up to 2 TVs in the living room, a table for card games, and drinking games in the kitchen. Everyone had a great time not an issue, not even much of a mess to clean up. \\n\\nToday everyone woke up happy not a issue. We all agree to head to Denny’s to get breakfast before we go to a small Star Wars convention being held in my town. This is where the real story starts. \\n\\nMy cousin (26F) we will call her Betty, she thought it would be funny to try to pants her boyfriend (31M) in the parking lot of the Denny’s. I was instantly annoyed that I had to even tell my 26 year old cousin not to try to pull down her boyfriends pants in a public parking lot of a restaurant in front of windows where family’s are eating breakfast with their kids. I told her “stop acting like a Jackass! I work in the community and I visit this Denny’s often while working. These people know me so just act like an adult.” She was obviously pissed that I said something to her in front of all our friends. \\n\\nWe finally get into the restaurant we’re sitting down ordering food. The waitress walks away and we’re all taking having a good time. There are 7 of us at the table. All feeling the pain from the night prior now they we all are over or close to 30. \\n\\nMy cousin Betty randomly reaches over and pinches her boyfriends nipple. This wasn’t a cute pinch. She grabbed ahold like her index finger and thumb was a alligator feeding on a snack. Her man let out a screech. It was unexpected and uncalled for. Instantly I’m enraged. I already had to ask her to not act like that outside and now she’s abusing her own boyfriend. I instantly started to aggressively talk at her. \\n\\nMe “What the fuck is wrong with you! Why can’t you fucking stop! Your 26 and I have to tell you to not pants your 31 year old boyfriend in the parking lot and now you’re doing this stupid shit” \\n\\nBetty” Your in your community stop talking to me like this!” \\n\\nMe “Yes we are in my community these people know me I visit here all the time and I don’t care any more your acting like a fucking bitch to your own boyfriend! Your tried to embarrass him outside and now you caused him pain to the point he screamed. If you were a man and doing that shit to a woman I would have beaten the fuck out of you! Your being a fucking cunt for no reason!” \\n\\nAt this point she storms out of the restaurant and doesn’t even eat her food. Everyone else stays and eats their food. We all pay the bill and leave. Betty goes up to my buddy and demands that they dive a hour and a half home right now and miss the convention they all originally came out for. My buddy not wanting to have any more conflict complied. We drive back to my house we all get out of the car and I can’t keep my silence anymore. I yelled.\\n\\nMe “I can’t believe we’re all the way back here what a fucking waste of time and gas to come back here because my cousin wanted to abuse her boyfriend” \\n\\nBetty: “This is your neighborhood don’t yell”\\n\\nMe: “This is my neighborhood! And I’m disgusted that my cousin treats her own boyfriend like that at 26 and doesn’t see a problem with her fucking actions! Now get your shit out of my fucking house and leave!” \\n\\nI walk in with Betty and my fiancée. I go upstairs to use the bathroom while Betty gets her things from the spare bedroom. I hear my front door slam closed and I go back outside. My buddy already left. No one even said good bye. \\n\\nSo Reddit, AITA for getting mad at my cousin?\\n\\n\\nTL;DR my cousin was abusing her bf and causing a scene so I said shit to her","target":"no","rationale":"The author of the post had a party at their house, which was fun and successful. However, the next day their cousin and boyfriend caused a scene at Denny's by pinching his nipple hard. The author was annoyed that they had to tell their cousin not to be inappropriate in public and called her out for acting like an asshole. Their cousin left Denny's early and then demanded that everyone else leave with her rather than go to a convention that they came for, so the group left early because no one wanted any further conflict. When they returned home, the author got angry again about how much time and gas money were wasted because of their cousin's behavior towards her boyfriend. They told them both to get out of the house when it became apparent that no one was going to say goodbye before leaving abruptly without saying anything in return.\\\\nThe author is not wrong here because they are upset with how poorly their cousin treated her own boyfriend both outside Denny's (by trying to pants him) and inside (by pinching his nipple). Their anger is understandable given how inappropriate their cousin acted around others, including children who may have witnessed these events while eating breakfast with their families inside Denny's windows.\\\\nIt is also understandable why the rest of the group decided it would be best if everyone went home early rather than stay for the convention since no one wanted any more conflict or unpleasantness after being embarrassed by your own family member can ruin an otherwise enjoyable outing.\\""},{"source":"Answer based on context:\\n\\nIn week 7, the Lions hosted the Atlanta Falcons.

Atlanta took the lead with a 1-yard quarterback sneak by Matt Ryan. In the second quarter, Jason Hanson kicked another field goal, this time from 38 yards out. Atlanta scored the final points of the first half when Roddy White caught an 18-yard touchdown pass. After halftime, Jason Hanson kicked his third field goal, this one from 29 yards.

One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the imbalance of ocean mass fluxes. After the volcano eruption, evaporation over ocean becomes lower, because it is largely determined by the ocean skin temperature change. The quick response of evaporation to the surface cooling and the delayed response of river runoff to the associated lower precipitation lead to an increased sea level. About 1~2 years later, river discharge becomes less due to the reduced precipitation and less sea ice melting, which cause sea level to drop.[9]\\n\\nand the situation: In the beginning of year 1000 mount Etna had a huge volcanic eruption. To test the effect of volcanic eruption on sea level scientists measured geological data through carbon dating. They measured the data for four different time point - for year 998, year 1000, year 1002, and year 1010. Scientists now need to compare and analyze these data.\\n\\nAnswer the following question: According to Grinsted, when would the sea level be higher, year 1000 or year 1002?","target":"1000","rationale":"The background explains that the sea level will rise 1-2 years after a volcanic eruption and then drop. Since 998 is two years before 1000, it can be deduced that in 1002 (two years later) there would have been less precipitation. This means evaporation over oceans was lower than at year 1000 because of the reduced river discharge due to high levels of precipitation. Therefore, Grinsted’s argument suggests year 1000 had higher sea levels than in year 1002."},{"source":"I cut all contact with him after that email and deleted my Facebook and MySpace accounts ( for various reasons - him just being one of them ) .

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. \\nQuestion: Which group that inhabited the Valley were the most advanced? \\nIs the correct answer The native Archaic Indians?","target":"No","rationale":"The Archaics were not the most advanced group to inhabit the Valley.
