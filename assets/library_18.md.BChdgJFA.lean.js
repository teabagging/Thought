As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter at a rate of ten percent every 1.1 billion years. In about 600 million years, the Sun brightness will have disrupted the Carbon Cycle to the point that trees and forests (C3 photosynthetic plant life) will no longer be able to survive and in around 800 million years, the Sun will have killed all complex life on the Earth's surface and in the oceans. In 1.1 billion years' time, the Sun's increased radiation output will cause its circumstellar habitable zone to move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life will be reduced to single celled organisms. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life.

Then he further pushed the gear to gear C, which brought him to 800 million years from now. Finally, he pushed the gear to gear D, which brought him to 1.1 billion years from now.

The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work. \\nThe 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\"\\nThe central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk. The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess, a noted linguist. The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers; much was completed after Burges's death and Girouard considers that the muralist, Lonsdale, \\"was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved.\\"The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase.

New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper. The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣) on Long Island (長島), as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island. A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu (Chinese: 朝鲜族) or Joseonjok (Hangul: 조선족)) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens. Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.

Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. He regained consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. His singing voice was improved to the degree in which it sounds identical to Frank Sinatra. However, Donald had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head, while in front of a table of other different suicidal methods, including a noose, a grenade, a bomb, a knife, and poison. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so. That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon.\\nAt the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or Daisy regains Donald but the world loses him. Posed with the question \\"her or the world\\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - \\"Me! Me! Me! MEEE!!\\". Soon, Donald returns to his old self and forgets about his singing career and Daisy regains her lover.","target":"psychologist","rationale":"The psychologist warns that Donald may lose his singing voice and career.\\nSo the answer is \\"psychologist\\""},{"source":"I am interested in seeing a movie for US\\nthat works for me, what city or location?\\nthe movie theatre up on 8th and 10th street\\nthat works for me, i can set this up for you\\nokay great thank you\\nwhat times are you looking for to go?\\ni am looking to go any where between 5:30pm and 8:30 PM\\nokay i will check those dates for you\\nlet me know asap\\nunfortunately they don't really have those times available for you\\nwhat other times may they have?\\nthey only have 1:45 PM and then 11:45 PM\\nthat is too late for me\\nyes I can understand that \\nso they have no tickets left?\\nno they unfortunately have no tickets left for you at all\\nthat is very unfortunate","target":"yes it is","rationale":"The customer is expressing that it is unfortunate that the theater doesn't have any tickets left.

When asked on television \\"Can a guy who's five-foot-nine, 175 pounds make it in the pros?\\", he answered \\"Yes, he can. But it's a matter of ability and not size. I feel I can play; I don't know for sure, and those questions will be answered in the future.\\"  Flutie was seen as extremely attractive to the USFL, which was desperate for a star to reinvigorate the league as it was in financial difficulty. Meanwhile, the Buffalo Bills, who had the first pick of the 1985 NFL Draft, still had the rights to Jim Kelly (who had earlier spurned them to go to the USFL) and also had concerns about Flutie's height. He was selected by the USFL's New Jersey Generals (owned by Donald Trump) in the 1985 territorial draft, which took place in January, months before the 1985 NFL Draft. Flutie went through negotiations with Trump and agreed on a deal that would make him the highest paid pro football player and highest paid rookie in any sport with $7 million over 5 years; Flutie was officially signed on February 4, 1985. Having already signed with the USFL, Flutie was not selected in the NFL Draft until the 11th round, and the 285th overall pick by the Los Angeles Rams.  Flutie entered the USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many began to wonder if the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, as his first two professional passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, for a total of 174 yards, while running for 51 yards. Flutie completed 134 of 281 passes for 2,109 yards and 13 touchdowns with the Generals in 1985 in 15 games. He suffered an injury late in the season that saw him turn over the reins to reserve quarterback Ron Reeves. The Generals went on to sport an 11-7 record and a 2nd-place finish in the USFL's Eastern Conference. The USFL folded in 1986, and Flutie and punter Sean Landeta were the league's last active players in the NFL.\\n\\nAnswer this question \\"did he quit?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","target":"Flutie and punter Sean Landeta were the league's last active players in the NFL.","rationale":"The context talks about Flutie's decision to play in the USFL instead of the NFL, and then later joining the NFL.

Thus, it is clear from this information that although he did not start out as a player on an official NFL team (he first played for a different league), he eventually joined one after leaving said other league. \\nSince there is no evidence or mention anywhere else in this passage of him quitting any sport or football-related activity altogether, we can safely conclude that answer to our question is false (\\"did"},{"source":"In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.\\n\\nI am facing a new situation today: Ted had two farmlands.

Passage 1:The Fleur de Lys (initially Les Fleur de Lys [sic]) were a British band originally formed in late 1964, in Southampton, Hampshire, England. They recorded singles beginning in 1965 in the transitional Beat to psychedelic music genre, later known as freakbeat. The band had varied line-ups; only drummer Keith Guster was a member throughout their history. They finally disbanded in 1969. Keyboardist Pete Sears went on to play with Sam Gopal Dream, and recorded on four early Rod Stewart albums including \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\", and was a founding member of Jefferson Starship, going on to playing with Hot Tuna for ten years, and working with artists like John Lee Hooker, Dr. John, and Harvey Mandel, . Bassist Gordon Haskell would eventually replace Greg Lake in King Crimson before going on a successful solo career. Guitarist Bryn Haworth would move to the States and record an unreleased album under the name Wolfgang with a band including acclaimed bassist Leland Sklar. He would record solo albums in the 1970s for Island Records and A&M Records, before continuing his solo career on Contemporary Christian Music labels. \\n Passage 2:The value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the Age of Discovery, when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the Cape of Good Hope. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 bombardment by Louis XIV’s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the Piedmontese and Austrian armies when these two states came into conflict with France. Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the Habsburg troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the Ligurian Republic, modelled on the French Republic. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the French Empire (1805) and divided by Napoleon into three departments: Montenotte (department), with capital Savona, Gênes, with capital Genoa and the department of the Apennines, with the capital Chiavari.\\n Passage 3:During the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of Réunion and Mauritius. Many East India ships were seized by the French based on these islands during the Napoleonic Wars. They were taken by the British in a hard fought campaign by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the 1st Earl of Minto wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned Spice islands famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including Banda Neira, Ambon and Ternate fell to a British invasion with little loss. The following year Java fell to the British which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for transplantation throughout the British Empire. By the 1790's the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in Penang; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.","target":"2","rationale":"The question asks which department was larger and is specifically looking for information about a size of a geographical region, not about individuals or the East India Trading Company.

There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, cationic and anionic. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road.

Possibly the best I have ever seen in quite a while.The movie is pure originality and filled with grade A dialouge that only Tarantino can give.  The movie in all ways totaly lived up to my expectations and I still cant stop thinking about this masterpiece.  I think kb vol 2 stand on its own compared to vol 1.  The ending was quite suprising.  Not what I expected.  I love it!  The ending was beautiful and filled with tensions between the bride(...)The movie is more on the love side than blood dringing battles that took place in vol 1.Vol1 had more action and less dialoug but when you watch vol 2 you will be like \\"What vol 1?\\".  This film is so(...) good I might see it again.Bride is back for her final cut as she has to kill her way until that last person is BILL.  She will encounter new enemies such as bud(Bills brother)who was once an assasin for the DivAs.  But now is a drunk who lives in a trailer.  The movie is also longer than vol 1.  Thats really a good thing..  The movie is filled with action that you wont be able to blink one eye....Ok yeah you can..  You also take a stroll around the park as you see how The Bride(...) Learned her techneek.  From her master who is very dissaplint at what he teaches, the bride will stop at nothing to get what she came to do.  The movies dialouge is the most important one of all.  So pure.  So good only Tarantino can give us this!  I won't spoil anything for you but I can assure you this.  Kill Bill volume 2 is a masterpiece.  It is very underated and for those who think its over rated get your hw and come back when you realize what you've been missing out on.  Original, Pure, The best.  I choose this as my 2004 film of the year!Final note......DO NOT!  I REPEAT!  DO NOT GET Vol 1 or vol 2 on dvd.  If alot of people know how Tarantino is you know one damn thing....There will always be some Collecters edition crap with lots of added footage and great behind the scene footage.  What I'm trying to say is there will probably be some 3 disc  collecters edition with the unrated/Directors cut filled with all the color and gore you can feed on.  And it will probably have some great footage.  Though I dont think vol 2 didn't have any violent things taken out since it's main purpose wasn't violence in vol 2.  Even though there is 200$ special edition box set in japan just wait for some collecters edition to hit US probably around the end of 2004 or sometime in 2005.

This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert.

A microarray system is described for an unbiased detection of plant viruses using both short (30 nt) and long (50 and 70 nt) oligonucleotide probes. The assay involves amplification of target nucleic acid using random primers followed by in vitro transcription whose cRNA product is labeled chemically, fragmented and used as target for hybridization. Initial optimization tests with Turnip vein clearing virus and Cauliflower mosaic virus showed increased hybridization efficiency with shorter cDNA targets (100 bp) and longer probes (50 and 70 nt). The system was validated in pure and mixed samples by detection of three Tymovirus species: Asclepias asymptomatic virus, Kennedya yellow mosaic virus and Turnip yellow mosaic virus. The method could detect sequence variants with 70-75% or higher sequence identity, indicating the possible utility of the approach for virus discovery. Array performance comparison of long probes demonstrated the competence of 50-mers to provide a satisfactory balance between detection sensitivity and specificity. The work described is a significant step towards a method to assess, in one assay, the presence of a large diversity of relatives of known viruses of plants. \\n Title: Oligonucleotide-based microarray for detection of plant viruses employing sequence-independent amplification of targets","target":"False","rationale":"The paragraph describes a microarray system for unbiased detection of plant viruses using both short (30 nt) and long (50 and 70 nt) oligonucleotide probes.

The paragraph indicates that the method could detect sequence variants with 70-75% or higher sequence identity, indicating its potential utility for virus discovery. Overall, it provides a detailed description of how this microarray system works to detect plant viruses in pure and mixed samples. However, while the title is informative about some aspects of this method (e.g., it involves amplification using oligonucleotides), it fails to provide key details about how the assay works or what type of virus detection this method is designed for (i.e., plant viruses).

The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories.

In 1548, riots break out in Angoumois and Saintonge demanding the release of the smugglers . The de Pitauds revolt grew to 20,000 members, led by a lord and joined by priests. Castles were plundered and salt-tax collectors killed. The revolt spread to Bordeaux where 20 salt tax collectors were killed, including the lieutenant governor, on August 21, 1548. King Henry II blockaded Bordeaux and launched his repression. Bordeaux lost its privileges. It was disarmed, paid a fine, saw its parliament suspended, and 1,401 people were sentenced to death.

After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Brian, his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine.\\n\\nRecording sessions for the band's first album took place in Capitol's basement studios in the famous tower building in August 1962, but early on Brian lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Brian's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Brian fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production - though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.  In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's United Western Recorders on Sunset Boulevard. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use double tracking on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. The Surfin' U.S.A. album was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.  Brian was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the Surfer Girl album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Brian decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, Little Deuce Coupe, which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the Surfer Girl LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Brian was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.  For much of the decade, Brian attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists. On July 20, 1963, \\"Surf City\\", which he co-wrote with Jan Berry of Jan and Dean, was his first composition to reach the top of the US charts. The resulting success pleased Brian, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean. Brian's other non-Beach Boy work in this period included tracks by the Castells, Donna Loren, Sharon Marie, the Timers, and the Survivors. The most notable group to which Wilson would attach himself in this era would be the Honeys, which Wilson intended as the female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and as an attempt to compete with Phil Spector-led girl groups such as the Crystals and the Ronettes. He continued juggling between recording with the Beach Boys and producing records for other artists, but with less success at the latter--except for Jan and Dean.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Brian Wilson","rationale":"The title of the text is \\"Brian Wilson\\", and it talks about Brian's life story.

And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from.

His position at work is tenuous as he departs for London to attend his daughter Susan's wedding. Upon arrival at Heathrow Airport, he encounters Kate Walker, a single Londoner who collects statistics from passengers as they pass through the terminals. Tired and anxious to get to his hotel, Harvey brusquely dismisses her when she approaches him to ask questions.\\nHarvey is upset to discover his ex-wife Jean rented a house to accommodate family and friends from the States but failed to include him. At the rehearsal dinner on the night preceding the wedding, it becomes increasingly clear Harvey is systematically being excluded from the clan around his ex-wife's new husband Brian and is treated as a mere guest. They fake their politeness towards him and make him feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. When Harvey tells Susan, with whom he has shared a strained relationship since his divorce, that he will be attending the ceremony but not the subsequent reception because he needs to return to the States for an important meeting, she informs him she has asked her stepfather Brian to give her away.\\nMeanwhile, Kate is on a blind date that is not going well. When she returns to the table after taking yet another call from her neurotic mother Maggie, who is certain her Polish neighbor is burying bodies in a shed in his yard, she discovers her date has invited friends to join them. Feeling unwanted and excluded from the conversation, she eventually excuses herself and goes home.\\nThe following morning Harvey attends the wedding but quickly leaves for the airport without congratulating the married couple. But due to heavy traffic delays he misses his flight at Heathrow. When he calls his boss Marvin to advise him he will be returning a day later than planned, he is fired. Determined to drown his sorrows, Harvey goes to an airport bar and sees Kate. Recognizing her from the day before, he apologizes for his rude behavior. She initially resists the attention he is paying her but soon they're both glad to finally have an honest conversation about what they're feeling and thinking.\\nHarvey follows Kate to the Heathrow Express and, upon arrival at Paddington station, asks if he can walk her to her writing class on the South Bank. She accepts his offer and is pleased when he offers to meet her after class. As they stroll along the River Thames, Harvey mentions he is missing Susan's wedding reception, and Kate urges him to go. He finally relents, but only if she will accompany him. When Kate insists she is not properly dressed for such an occasion, Harvey buys her a dress and the two head to the Grosvenor House Hotel, where they are welcomed coolly by Susan and get two places at the children's table. When the father of the bride is called upon to make a toast, Brian rises and begins to speak until Harvey interrupts. He then delivers an eloquent speech that redeems him with his daughter and endears him to Kate.\\nImmediately following the first dance of the bride and groom, the groom calls Harvey up to dance with his daughter for the Father-Daughter Dance. He happily does so, and then all the guests join them on the floor for the rumba, tango and other dances, with Harvey enjoying himself on the dance floor, alone. Kate is left at the table, once again in the same position as when she was on her blind date. Her smile becomes more strained as she looks about and sees herself alone at the table in a room of strangers for several dances, Harvey having apparently forgotten she was there. When she surmises he will not be coming to ask her to dance, her smile disappears and she quietly leaves the room and stands in front of the elevator, preparing to leave.\\nHarvey, now looking for Kate, goes into the corridor and seeing her waiting for the elevator, he disappears into a side annex with a piano and begins to softly play one of his own jazz compositions for her. She hears the music and follows it, finding Harvey smiling and waiting for her. He asks her to return to the reception to dance and stay with him. She smiles and agrees.\\nFollowing the reception, Harvey and Kate walk and talk until dawn. They exchange a single, gentle kiss and agree to meet at noon. At his hotel, Harvey experiences serious heart palpitations and is rushed to the hospital, where he receives a call from Marvin who, having discovered his employee is more indispensable than he thought, urges him to return to work as soon as possible. Harvey decides he prefers to remain in London and explore the possibility of a relationship with Kate. He tracks her down at her writing class and reveals why he missed their rendezvous. Overcautious about romance because of so many past disappointments, Kate initially resists his suggestion that they see what the future might bring them, but finally agrees to give things a chance.\\nAs they slowly stroll away, Harvey invites Kate to ask him the questions she would have asked him at the airport terminal, and this time, he happily answers, telling her his place of residence \\"...is in transition.\\"","target":"Where is the wedding reception being held?","rationale":"Here's a question that can be answered based on the summary: Where is the wedding reception being held?

Therefore we tested ESS/ESVI together with standard hemodynamic variables as possible predictors of outcome in 39 patients with various valvular lesions who underwent valve replacement. Thirteen patients had preoperative mitral regurgitation, 16 had aortic stenosis, nine had aortic regurgitation, and one had mitral stenosis. Twenty-seven patients (group S) had a satisfactory outcome as defined by a return to NYHA class I or II together with a normal postoperative ejection fraction. Twelve patients who died, remained in class III or IV, or had a subnormal postoperative ejection fraction were deemed to have an unsatisfactory result (group U). Mean right atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index (ESVI), and end-systolic wall stress were all greater in group U, whereas ESS/ESVI and ejection fraction were lower in group U. When these and other factors were submitted to stepwise discriminant multivariate analysis, ESS/ESVI and ESVI were the only independent predictors of outcome. However, when patients with mitral regurgitation (who might have biased the study) were excluded, discriminant analysis showed ESVI as the only independent predictive variable. We conclude that end-systolic indicators of ventricular function are superior to other standard hemodynamic variables in predicting outcome of valve replacement. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes several numerical values, such as \\"13 patients\\", \\"16 patients\\", \\"9 patients\\", and \\"1 patient\\".

Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes. The heart is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.\\nIn humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right ventricles. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the \\"right heart\\" and their left counterparts as the \\"left heart\\". Fish in contrast have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.\\nThe heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulationwhere the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.\\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30%...\\n\\n- A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\".\\n\\n- Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.\\n\\n- The ostrich or common ostrich (\\"Struthio camelus\\") is either one or two species of large flightless birds native to Africa, the only living member(s) of the genus \\"Struthio\\", which is in the ratite family. In 2014, the Somali ostrich (\\"Struthio molybdophanes\\") was recognized as a distinct species.\\n\\n- Hummingbirds are birds from the Americas that constitute the family Trochilidae. They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring . Indeed, the smallest extant bird species is a hummingbird, the 5-cm bee hummingbird weighing less than a U.S. penny (2.5 g).\\n\\n- Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.\\n\\n- A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).\\nThe passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.\\n\\n- A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin \\"oscen\\", \\"a songbird\\". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song.\\n\\n- Ornithischia ( / rnski / or - ni - THISS - kee -  ) or Predentata is an extinct clade of beaked , herbivorous dinosaurs . The name ornithischia is derived from the Greek ornitheos (  ) meaning ' of a bird ' and ischion (  ) meaning ' hip joint ' . They are known as the ' bird - hipped ' dinosaurs because of their bird - like hip structure , even though birds actually belong to the ' lizard - hipped ' dinosaurs ( the saurischians ) . Some commonly known Ornithischians include the horned dinosaurs ( ceratopsians ) , armored dinosaurs ( stegosaurs and ankylosaurs ) , Iguanodon , and the \`\` duck - billed '' dinosaurs ( hadrosaurids ) . Being herbivores that sometimes lived in herds , they were more numerous than the saurischians . Many were prey animals for the theropods and were usually smaller than the sauropods .\\n\\n- Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\\n\\n- The bee hummingbird, zunzuncito or Helena hummingbird (\\"Mellisuga helenae\\") is a species of hummingbird.\\n\\n- The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.\\n\\n- Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. \\n\\n- Feathers are epidermal growths that form the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds. They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates, and indeed a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

A phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. Scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, a “tree of life” can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms (Figure 20.2). Unlike a taxonomic classification diagram, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history. Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. Scientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains— Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya—diverge from a single point and branch off. The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms.

Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

In 1933 the team qualified for the new regional first division Gauliga Ostpreußen , one of 16 new regional circuits formed in the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich that year . They played another season there before the league was split into two divisions making Viktoria part of the Gauliga Allenstein for the next three campaigns . In 1939 -- 40 they failed in an attempt to win their way back to the division in their own right when they lost a playoff 0:7 to Preußen Mlawa . Instead , playing alongside SV Allenstein , the team became part of Sportgemeinde Allenstein which played a single season in the Gauliga Ostpreußen .

Or more likely when the secondlast person who speaks it dies because then there is no one left to talk to. According to linguists   there is nothing unusual about a single language dying out. But what is happening today is quite remarkable. According to the recent statistics, there are approximately 6,000 languages in the world as we speak. Of these, about half are going to die out in the next century.\\nThere are several reasons as to why a language can eventually die out. These range from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, to sociological factors, like cultural assimilation, in which the culture of a minority group is gradually replaced by a stronger one. The former can cause tribes to leave their natural habitat  and therefore become fewer and fewer in number. However, it doesn't happen very frequently. In fact, the latter is a much bigger threat and it is responsible for the extinction of a lot of languages in countries like the USA and Australia. For instance, Chemehuevi is one of the languages which is really close to dying out since its sole speaker is an old, yet healthy, man named Johnny Hill, Jr.\\nIt is very important for as many languages as possible to be preserved. Scientists have been trying to raise people's awareness on how certain tribes have specific words which cannot be expressed in let's say English simply because there is no equal meaning. Namely, the Yupik of Alaska have 99 names to describe different layers of ice formation, or how the Tofa of Siberia classify reindeer  . In other words, when languages die out, mankind's wisdom reduces.\\nOn a happier note, there are many famous cases which show what can be done to preserve languages in danger of extinction. In particular, the Maori in New Zealand have created socalled \\"language nests\\": organizations which help children under five learn the language. They provide them with a setting where they are exposed to the language...\\nQuestion: The author believes that   _  .\\nOptions: A: all languages are finally going to die out\\nB: human wisdom can be reflected in languages\\nC: the protective approaches have proved ineffective\\nD: the current situation of languages hardly requires attention","target":"B","rationale":"The author believes that human wisdom can be reflected in languages.

Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.\\n\\n- Carmen is an opera in four acts by French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years. \\"Carmen\\" has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon; the \\"Habanera\\" from act 1 and the \\"Toreador Song\\" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.\\n\\n- Samba is a Brazilian musical genre and dance style, with its roots in Africa via the West African slave trade and African religious traditions, particularly of Angola and the Congo, through the samba de roda genre of the northeastern state of Bahia, from which it derived.

Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his...","target":"Cooke","rationale":"The quote \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\" is in the paragraph about Mahler's middle period.

Analysis of the early phenotypes and molecular events following β-Catenin activation is therefore essential for better understanding HCC pathogenesis. The AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is a putative β-Catenin target gene and promotes hepatocyte survival, proliferation, and liver tumorigenesis, suggesting that c-Jun may be a key target of β-Catenin signaling in the liver.', 'To address this issue, the immediate hepatic phenotypes following deletion of the tumor suppressor Apc and subsequent β-Catenin activation were analyzed in mice. The contribution of c-Jun to these phenotypes was dissected in double mutant animals lacking both, Apc and c-Jun. β-Catenin was rapidly activated in virtually all Apc mutant hepatocytes while c-Jun was induced only after several days, suggesting that its expression was rather a secondary event following Apc deletion in the liver. Loss of Apc resulted in increased hepatocyte proliferation, hepatomegaly, deregulated protein metabolism, and premature death. Interestingly, additional deletion of c-Jun did not affect hepatocyte proliferation but resulted in increased liver damage and mortality.

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, \\"Treme.\\" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series \\"The Wire\\" and the miniseries \\"The Pacific.\\" Read an excerpt from \\"The Cut\\" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel.

On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray.\\nContext: In 1831 a runaway convict named George Clarke, who had lived with Aborigines in the area for several years, claimed that a large river called Kindur flowed north-west from the Liverpool ranges in New South Wales to the sea. Charles Sturt believed that the Murray-Darling system formed the main river system of New South Wales and Mitchell wanted to prove Sturt wrong. Mitchell formed an expedition consisting of himself, assistant surveyor George Boyle White and 15 convicts who were promised remission for good conduct. Mitchell took 20 bullocks, three heavy drays, three light carts and nine horses to carry supplies, and set out on 24 November 1831 to investigate the claim. On reaching Wollombi in the Hunter Valley, the local assistant surveyor, Heneage Finch, expressed a desire to join the expedition. He had established his credentials by surveying a route from Sydney to Wollombi, so Mitchell approved his request, provided he obtained extra supplies and men, and he followed along later.  The expedition continued northward, climbed the Liverpool Range on 5 December, and made Quirindi on 8 December. Shortly afterwards Finch arrived but inexplicably had not brought provisions, so Mitchell immediately sent him back to get them. By 11 December the expedition had reached Wallamoul Station near Tamworth, the northern extent of white settlement at the time.  Mitchell continued his northward push into new territory, taking local Kamilaroi people to assist in finding water and to express his peaceful intentions. By early January 1832 he was in the vicinity of the present town of Narrabri, reached the Gwydir River in mid-January, and found the Barwon by the end of the month, where he set up camp. Mitchell left the main party and made a reconnaissance down the Barwon until he found its junction with the Gwydir. After Mitchell returned to the main camp, Finch arrived with tragic news. He had been travelling with three convicts and provisions but, because of a shortage of water, the group had separated. He left two men behind while he attempted to locate the main expedition. Having failed to do that, on the second day he returned to the campsite to discover that it had been ransacked. Supplies were scattered and beneath the wreckage were two dead men. The immediate effect was that Mitchell decided to abandon the expedition and return south. The party reached the Gwydir on 8 February and was near the site of the attack on 17 February. Mitchell buried the two bodies and salvaged some equipment. Once back at Wallamoul, Mitchell placed White in charge of the main party, while he returned hastily to Sydney. He was satisfied that there was no truth about the river Kindur claimed by Clarke. Fourteen years after the attack, Mitchell revealed that the convicts had indulged in sexual relations with Aboriginal women.\\nQuestion: Was he correct in his belief?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"The immediate effect was that Mitchell decided to abandon the expedition and return south.","rationale":"The answer is correct.

According to John Allen Giles, in the preface to his own edition published by the Caxton Society in 1845, the Chronicon was attributed by both Simon Patrick and Henry Wharton to John of Caleto (or \\"Caux\\"), who was an abbot of Peterborough (1250–1262). Giles reported a marginal note in the manuscript making a similar attribution, besides a similar note at the beginning of the manuscript stating that it belonged to Peterborough Abbey. However, Giles observed that this manuscript attribution was \\"comparatively modern\\", and regarded the chronicle's author as unknown. In Giles's view, the Chronicon is \\"extremely valuable both on account of the numerous facts which it contains, and for the [700 years] which it embraces.\\"","target":"b","rationale":"The passage provides information about the location of Peterborough Abbey, but does not provide any information about the birthplace of the man who called the manuscript \\"comparatively modern\\".

The swap proved decisive as the Briton clawed back a 20-second advantage Contador had built up earlier in the stage. The Spaniard now moves up to second overall, four minutes 34 seconds behind Froome with just four stages remaining.

Aliens are currently studying the two planets to see if either of them are suitable for habitation. While studying the planets, they discover that both planets have the same type of atmosphere. However, there is one key difference. The difference is that the current species of animals on Blimpton emit much more chlorofluorocarbons than Jarmel's animals do. The aliens take note of this so they can report back to their bosses on what they have found.\\n\\nand a hint : There is a large area of low ozone concentration or \\"ozone hole\\" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December. The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the ozone into other gases.Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.\\n\\nPlease answer this question : Which planet's stratosphere is warmer?","target":"Jarmel","rationale":"The aliens in this situation observed that Blimpton's animals are emitting more chlorofluorocarbons than Jarmel's.

This systematic review of interventions for carers of patients using home cancer and palliative care services searched Medline, CancerLit, Psycinfo and Cinahl databases. The terms used were carer(s), caregiver(s), palliative and cancer. Papers that reported interventions for adults actively providing informal care for noninstitutionalized cancer and palliative care patients were reviewed. Twenty-two interventions were identified, comprising home nursing care (four), respite services (three), social networks and activity enhancement (two), problem solving and education (three) and group work (10). Of these, nine were delivered solely to carers (i.e., were targeted services). Only six of the carers' interventions had been evaluated, two of these had used a randomized control trial (RCT; grades IB), three employed a single group methodology (two prospective grades IIIC and one retrospective grade IIIC) and one was evaluated using facilitator feedback. There was a lack of outcome evaluation designs, small sample sizes and a reliance on intervention descriptions and formative evaluations. Methodological challenges may mean alternatives to 'pure' RCTs should be considered. The current evidence contributes more to understanding feasibility and acceptability than to effectiveness.

The band was initially co-led by the Austrian-born keyboard player Joe Zawinul, the American saxophonist Wayne Shorter and Czech bassist Miroslav Vitous. Due to creative and financial disagreements, Vitous left the band after a few years. Zawinul took increasing control and steered the band towards a more funk, R&B oriented sound.\\n\\nWeather Report's debut album Weather Report (1971) caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival, due to the various talents of the group's members and their unorthodox approach to their music. The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years, predominantly using acoustic bass, with Shorter exclusively playing soprano saxophone. It built on the avant-garde experiments which Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on Bitches Brew, including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favor of continuous rhythm and movement. Down Beat magazine described the album as \\"music beyond category\\". Although Airto Moreira completed the recording of the debut Weather Report album, his existing commitments to Miles Davis prevented him from performing live with the group. Barbara Burton performed at Weather Report's first residency (a week of performances at Paul's Mall in Boston, prior to the album release), but could not come to business terms with Zawinul over tour plans. Zawinul subsequently removed both her album credit and that of Alias, leaving Moreira as the only percussionist credited. For the upcoming concerts, former Brazil '66 member Dom Um Romao was recruited as the group's new percussionist on Moreira's own recommendation.  After further gigs in Philadelphia, Weather Report went on to a tour of Europe. Following disagreements on tour, Mouzon was replaced by another former McCoy Tyner drummer, Eric Gravatt.  In 1972, Weather Report released its second album, I Sing the Body Electric. The first side featured new studio recordings, while the second side was taken from live recordings of a concert in Tokyo, featuring the full-band lineup of Zawinul, Shorter, Vitous, Gravatt, and Um Romao (and later available in full as the Japan-only double album Live in Tokyo). The studio side used extended versions of the band including various guest performers, suggesting that Weather Report was not necessarily an integral jazz band, but might possibly work as an expandable project set up to realise the music of its three composers. The album also featured Zawinul's first use of a synthesizer (an instrument with which he would become synonymous within jazz) and of sound effects.  I Sing the Body Electric also showed the first signs of a shift in the balance of control within the band, away from the more collective approach of the debut album. During the following year, this tendency would develop further.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: describe the article in one word","target":"continuous","rationale":"The text states that Weather Report's debut album built on the avant-garde experiments which Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis, including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favor of continuous rhythm and movement. \\nThis shows that one word to describe a characteristic feature of Weather Report is \\"continuous\\"."},{"source":"Article: The most famous reformer of Estonian, Johannes Aavik (1880–1973), used creations ex nihilo (cf. ‘free constructions’, Tauli 1977), along with other sources of lexical enrichment such as derivations, compositions and loanwords (often from Finnish; cf.

Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875.\\nThe company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford.

Their debut album, One Touch, was released in the UK through London Records on 27 November 2000. The album achieved moderate success, peaking at number 26 in April 2001 and eventually being certified Gold. In 2001, Donaghy departed the group amid rumours of a rift with Buchanan and the group were dropped by their record label.\\n\\nThe Sugababes were formed in 1998 by All Saints manager Ron Tom. Siobhan Donaghy and Mutya Buena, both aged just 13, had been signed as solo artists, but decided to work together after performing at the same showcase. While working in the studio, Buena invited her best friend Keisha Buchanan to watch them. Manager Tom decided the three girls were to be a trio, likening their different appearances to the United Colors of Benetton campaign. Originally dubbed the Sugababies, the group's name was tweaked to Sugababes when they were signed by London Records to give the group a more mature image.  The group's debut single, \\"Overload\\", peaked at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart in 2000 and was nominated for a BRIT Award for Best Single. The group co-wrote most of the tracks on debut album One Touch with the help of All Saints producer Cameron McVey. One Touch peaked at number 26 on the UK Albums Chart. The album produced three more top 40 hits--\\"New Year\\", \\"Run for Cover\\" and \\"Soul Sound\\". The sales of One Touch did not meet London Records' expectations, and they dropped the group in 2001. It was later certified gold by the BPI and had sold 220,000 copies in the UK by 2008 according to Music Week.  During a Japanese promotional tour in August 2001, Donaghy left the group. She stated initially that she wanted to pursue a fashion career, but was eventually diagnosed with clinical depression amid reports of in-fighting amongst the group's members. Donaghy later stated that she was forced out of the group by Buchanan and called Buchanan the \\"first bully\\" in her life. Former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range was announced as Donaghy's replacement.  Having already started work on a second album with new member Range, the trio looked for a new record label, eventually signing to Island Records. Their first single on the new label, \\"Freak like Me\\" scored the group their first UK number 1 single. Follow-up single \\"Round Round\\" also debuted on top of the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Both singles were certified silver by the BPI. On the back of the success of the singles, the group's second album, Angels with Dirty Faces, debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and was later certified triple platinum, selling almost a million copies in the UK alone. It is to date their highest-selling album. In the UK, the third single from the album, a ballad titled \\"Stronger\\", gained the girls their third consecutive top ten hit in their native country. The track was released as a double-A side with \\"Angels with Dirty Faces\\" in the UK, the latter song chosen as the theme tune to The Powerpuff Girls Movie. A fourth single, the Sting-sampling \\"Shape\\", made the top ten in the Netherlands and Ireland in early 2003.  The group's third album, Three, was released in late 2003 and reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, earning the group a BRIT Award nomination for Best Album. Certified double platinum, it has sold 855,000 copies to date. The album was preceded by lead single \\"Hole in the Head\\", which became the group's third UK number 1 single. It also reached number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway, and became the Sugababes' first (and to date only) single to chart in the United States, reaching number 96 on the Billboard Hot 100. Follow-up single \\"Too Lost in You\\" appeared on the soundtrack to the film Love Actually and went top ten in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK. The album's third single, \\"In the Middle\\", was released in 2004 and garnered the group another BRIT Award nomination for Best Single; like its successor, the ballad \\"Caught in a Moment\\", it went to number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, the trio sang on the Band Aid 20 remake of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\", which went to number 1 in the UK in December.  Around this time, the group's perceived \\"moodiness\\", alleged backstage catfights, and press junket tantrums were tabloid fodder in Britain. They were surrounded by continuous rumours of in-fighting within the group and constant split reports. Rumours suggested that Buchanan and Buena had bullied Range, although Range herself repeatedly denied such allegations; Buena later admitted that she \\"just didn't talk to her\\" when she first joined. Buchanan claimed there was only one serious fallout between herself and Range during a 2004 gig in Dublin, regarding Britney Spears' \\"Toxic\\".  After a hiatus, the Sugababes released their thirteenth single, \\"Push the Button\\" in October 2005. The song debuted at number 1 in the UK and remained in the position for three consecutive weeks. It also peaked at number one in Ireland, Austria and New Zealand, and reached the top three across Europe and in Australia. Certified silver in the UK, it was later nominated at the BRIT Awards for Best Single. Parent album Taller in More Ways became the group's first UK number 1 album. The group was number 1 on the singles, album, airplay and download charts simultaneously, making them the first girl group to achieve such a feat. Taller in More Ways was certified double platinum in the UK.  Following an apparent illness that prevented Buena from promoting follow-up single \\"Ugly\\", it was announced on 21 December 2005 that Buena had left the Sugababes. According to an announcement on their official website, Buena's decision was based purely on personal reasons following the birth of her daughter. Amelle Berrabah joined the Sugababes in late December 2005, having been chosen by the group's management to replace Buena.  The third single from Taller in More Ways was a re-recorded version of \\"Red Dress\\", which was released in early 2006, and gave the Sugababes their third consecutive top five hit from the album, entering the UK Singles Chart at number 4. Berrabah re-recorded three of the album's twelve tracks and co-wrote a new song with Buchanan and Range named \\"Now You're Gone\\". The tracks appeared on a re-release of Taller in More Ways that reached number 18 on the UK Albums Chart. The fourth and final single from Taller in More Ways was \\"Follow Me Home\\", released only in the UK in June, where it charted at number 32.  In mid-2006, the group returned to the studio to record two new tracks for their first greatest hits collection, titled Overloaded: The Singles Collection. The lead single from the compilation, \\"Easy\\" peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst the compilation album, released in November 2006, peaked at number 3.

Lacking an adult in her life that she feels close to, she frequently goes into phone booths to speak with her mother, who never appears in the film. Stella has no interest in schoolwork and her uncle, who sees a theatrical career as being her only alternative to working behind the counter at Woolworths, signs her up for speech lessons and pulls the strings to get her involved at a regional playhouse. After an unsuccessful audition, Stella gets a job gofering for Meredith Potter (Hugh Grant), the troupe's sleazy, eccentric director.The impressionable Stella develops a crush on the worldly, self-absorbed Potter, whose homosexuality completely eludes her. Potter reveals himself to be a cruel, apathetic man who treats Stella and everyone else around him with scorn and condescension and has a long history of exploiting young men. His latest dalliance is with Geoffrey (Alan Cox), another teenage apprentice.

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed.\\nA very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future.\\nA small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science.\\nTwenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks.

Originally a synth-pop outfit, Ministry shifted its style to become one of the pioneers of industrial metal in the mid-to-late 1980s. The band's lineup has gone through many changes throughout its history, with Jourgensen remaining the only constant as the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist. Notable musicians who have contributed to the band's studio or live activities include Paul Barker, Martin Atkins, Bill Rieflin, Chris Connelly, Nivek Ogre, Mike Scaccia, Rey Washam, Paul Raven, Tommy Victor, Jason Christopher, Tony Campos, Burton C. Bell and DJ Swamp.\\n\\nMinistry's origins date to 1978, when Al Jourgensen went from Denver to Chicago, in order to study in University of Illinois. Jourgensen was introduced to the local underground scene by his then-girlfriend Shannon Rose Riley, and soon after joined a post-punk/new wave band Special Affect, replacing Tom Hoffman on a guitar and accompanying to vocalist Frank Nardiello (Groovie Mann of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult), drummer Harry Rushakoff (Concrete Blonde) and bassist Marty Sorenson. Following Special Affect's split, Jourgensen formed The Carmichaels, the short-lived band which featured Ben Krug, Tom Krug and Tom Wall (all of The Imports), and did numerous shows, including the one performed on April 30, 1981 with the local experimental band ONO as an opening act.  In this time Jourgensen had also met Jim Nash and Danny Flesher, the co-founders and the co-owners of the indie record label Wax Trax! Records who recommended him as a touring guitarist for a drag performer Divine. After playing a few concerts with the latter, Jourgensen--then living within an African-American neighborhood--had begun to write and record the songs in his apartment, using a newly-bought ARP Omni synthesizer, a drum machine, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder. At one point, he had presented a demo to Jim Nash, who had favored it and offered Jourgensen to record a single, as well as to form a touring band, certainly titled Ministry.  The first line-up of Ministry, assembled by Jourgensen, consisted of keyboardists Robert Roberts and John Davis, bassist Sorenson, and drummer Stephen George; initially, Jourgensen didn't want to perform vocals, but embarked on after he had auditioned twelve singers \\"who all sucked.\\" Nash had paid a recording session for the band at Hedden West studios, with the help of an English-born sound engineer Iain Burgess. According to former Dead Kennedys singer and Alternative Tentacles owner Jello Biafra, Ministry's debut record was intended to be seven-inch single featuring the song \\"Overkill\\" with B-side \\"I'm Falling\\"; eventually, a twelve-inch single with \\"I'm Falling\\" and instrumental track \\"Primental\\" on A-side, backed with song \\"Cold Life\\" on B-side, came out in late 1981 on Wax Trax! in the US. In March of the following year, the single was licensed by a British label Situation Two, with \\"Cold Life\\" as A-side.  Ministry had performed their debut concert on the New Year Eve of 1982 in a Chicago-based club Misfits, and commenced a tour through the East Coast and the mid-West, supporting on occasions for the English bands Medium Medium, A Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, and Depeche Mode. Meanwhile, \\"I'm Falling / Cold Life\\" single had found success in the UK and the US, reaching No. 45 in the Billboard Hot Dance/Disco chart with approximately 10,000 copies as of September 1982, and thus scoring Wax Trax!' first hit.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did that do","target":"Records who recommended him as a touring guitarist for a drag performer Divine.

The ratio (6:5) represents a fraction (6/11), so when you divide 262.8 by 11, you get 23.9~cm for both sides of the rectangle because if one side has 23.9~cm then the other side will have 23.9*(6/5) = 28,68 ~cm\\nThus, if each side has 23,9~cm then multiplying together we get a total area that equals 564 square centimeters which divided by pi gives us 180 square centimeters .

With nine seconds remaining in the half, Washington quarterback Jason Campbell passed to Chris Cooley in the end zone for a touchdown and Redskin lead.

Before they retire, they wanted to release a bonus track album from leftovers from seventies and eighties just for the fans. After playing the final show in Munich in December, 2012, band planned to take a break and go on vacation. In January, 2013, MTV contacted the band and asked if they are interested in doing the MTV Unplugged album. They agreed on doing that project and turned out to be successful. That whole thing pushed back the bonus track project. As soon as they have finished the MTV Unplugged project, band immediately went back to studio to work on bonus track project. Band was listening the recordings they have already prepared for the project. They were happy with the result and Rudolf Schenker said that he has a tape with some songs that they could also use for this project. While searching for the tape, Schenker found an old ledger in which his mother enumerated the loans that his father provided to him, so he could buy all the equipment and establish the band. He looked into the book and it said: \\"September, 1965\\". He went back to the studio and told the band what he found and their manager said that it would be great idea to celebrate 50th Anniversary since they are the only German band who is 50 years in music and one of the few in the world along with The Rolling Stones, The Who, Beach Boys and Pink Floyd. Manager suggested to the band that they contact the promoters and see if they are interested in band doing the 50th Anniversary Tour. Then Schenker suggested that if band is going to do a 50th Anniversary Tour, then band needs to release brand new studio album. So the band went again into the listening process of bonus track material that they have already prepare and see if they can improve something, like choruses and riffs. After that, they re-recorded the old stuff and started to write new songs with the producers Mikael Nord Andersson and Martin Hansen. The result was the album Return to Forever.\\n Passage 2:The northern segment of the fault runs from Hollister, through the Santa Cruz Mountains, epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, then up the San Francisco Peninsula, where it was first identified by Professor Lawson in 1895, then offshore at Daly City near Mussel Rock. This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County. It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland, runs just east of Bodega Head through Bodega Bay and back underwater, returning onshore at Fort Ross. (In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant \\"sister faults\\" run more-or-less parallel, and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes.) From Fort Ross, the northern segment continues overland, forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows. It goes back offshore at Point Arena. After that, it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino, where it begins to bend to the west, terminating at the Mendocino Triple Junction.\\n Passage 3:The first archaeological investigation of the site was carried out in 1964. In that year, the site was noted during an archaeological survey of the region directed by Maurits N. van Loon of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, and a small sounding was made. In 1965, a more extensive excavation was carried out, again under the direction of Van Loon. Between 1971 and 1974, work on the site was resumed by a team of the French Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) directed by Jacques Cauvin. All excavations were part of the larger international – and eventually UNESCO-coordinated – effort to investigate as many archaeological sites as possible in the area that would be flooded by Lake Assad, the reservoir of the Tabqa Dam, which was being built at that time. The filling of Lake Assad eventually led to the flooding of Mureybet in 1976. Although the site is now submerged and no longer accessible, the material that has been retrieved during the excavations continues to generate new research. This material is currently stored at the National Museum of Aleppo and the Institute de Préhistoire Orientale in Jalès-Berrias in France.","target":"2","rationale":"The question asks for the length of the Gualala River and passage 2 contains information about its location."},{"source":"Given the following passage\\n\\n\\"If the Governor General of Canada is unable to give assent, it can be done by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.”\\nLarisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...\\nQuestion: What is most likely going to be Larisa's next job?\\nOptions:\\n- studying depictions of India\\n- working on medieval tradition\\n- not enough information\\n- working with other manuscripts","target":"working with other manuscripts","rationale":"The context states that the Getty Museum's Mirror of History contains unique illuminations, and the researcher is focusing on the evolution of depictions of India across these various volumes.

Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.","target":"Greenland","rationale":"Since the given context mentions that Greenland increased their productivity and became wealthy, becoming wealthier likely led to higher SWB for its citizens.

Additionally, it is mentioned that when people become wealthier over time, there tends be more optimism within society.

From early childhood, his mother inspired a love of stories in him. He attended Hungarian-language primary school and gymnasium in Baia Mare from 1864 to 1871, earning top marks, and went to high school in the same town from 1872. In 1876, he graduated from high school in Cluj, where he studied for two years. He attended Franz Joseph University in the latter city, earning a doctorate in philosophy in 1881. His thesis, written in Hungarian, dealt with the work of Vasile Alecsandri, surveyed the Romanian literary context and included a dozen poems translated by Dulfu. After graduation, he moved to the Romanian Old Kingdom and worked as a teacher. After a brief stint in the capital Bucharest, he directed and taught at a school in Turnu Severin for the 1881-1882 year. Beginning in 1882, he again taught philosophy and later Romanian in Bucharest; one of the two schools where he worked was for girls. He came to know faculty colleague Ioan Slavici, as well as Mihail Eminescu, Alexandru Vlahuță and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu. In 1886, he married Elena Mateescu, with whom he had four children and who encouraged his work as a writer. He obtained Romanian citizenship in 1891. During World War I, he worked as a postal censor in the temporary capital of Iași, where an illness claimed one of his daughters. Although normally a disciplined teacher, he lost his composure on December 1, 1918, the day the union of Transylvania with Romania was proclaimed; cutting short the lesson and visibly moved, he explained the significance of the event to his pupils. In 1921, he retired from the girls' school, as the pupils daily reminded him of his deceased daughter.\\n Link Information: Vasile Alecsandri (; July 21, 1821August 22, 1890) Answer: 1821","target":"What is the birth year of the man whose works Dulfu's thesis dealt with?","rationale":"The given information provides a birth year and the work of a person, and the answer is asking for this person's birth year.

We achieve this by (i) first learning vector embeddings of single graph nodes and (ii) then composing them to compactly represent node sequences. Specifically, we propose SENSE-S (Semantically Enhanced Node Sequence Embedding - for Single nodes), a skip-gram based novel embedding mechanism, for single graph nodes that co-learns graph structure as well as their textual descriptions. We demonstrate that SENSE-S vectors increase the accuracy of multi-label classification tasks by up to 50% and link-prediction tasks by up to 78% under a variety of scenarios using real datasets. Based on SENSE-S, we next propose generic SENSE to compute composite vectors that represent a sequence of nodes, where preserving the node order is important. We prove that this approach is efficient in embedding node sequences, and our experiments on real data confirm its high accuracy in node order decoding.","target":"Node sequence embedding mechanism that captures both graph and text properties","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nNode sequence embedding mechanism that captures both graph and text properties."},{"source":"Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A dog walking on a beach\\", is the sentence \\"A dog is on a beach.\\" a true sentence?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"yes","rationale":"The word \\"dog\\" is repeated in both sentences, so we can safely assume that the two dogs are one and the same.

In the first group of seven studies, AII in a mean dose of 12.7 ng/kg/min was administered i.v. to water loaded dogs. The infusion induced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP, 99 to 118 mm Hg, P less than 0.001), and significant reductions in both glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 67 to 57 ml/min, P less than 0.05) and para-aminohippurate clearance (CPAH, 280 to 212 ml/min, P less than 0.005) occurred. Despite this decrement in renal hemodynamics, urine remained maximally dilute (Uosm, 58 to 61 mOsm/kg H2O, NS). Furthermore, plasma ADH was suppressed maximally after water load and did not increase after i.v. AII infusion. The IC infusion of AII (mean dose 5.8 ng/kg/min) produced similar changes in hemodynamics; plasma ADH remained undetectable. When AII was administered i.v. to hydropenic animals (mean dose 8.3 ng/kg/min), MAP again increased (86 to 111 mm Hg, P less than 0.001) as GFR (81.3 to 68.6 ml/min, NS) and CPAH (291 to 223 ml/min, P less than 0.05) declined modestly.

He is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers. He is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, although he rejected the term, preferring to be called a realist. He was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his rendition of dancers, racecourse subjects and female nudes. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation.\\n\\n- The National Gallery is an art museum in Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, in Central London.

Much to the dismay of many residents of the town, the weather in Smallville is often windy and cloudy. Citizens of Klangton are much happier since they rarely experience heavy winds and generally only have a couple clouds in the sky. Their weather is almost always sunny with almost clear skies.\\n\\nDo the clouds in Smallville have more or less electrons than the clouds in Klangton?\\n\\nHint: Electrons can be removed from some objects using friction, simply by rubbing one substance against another substance. There are many examples of objects becoming charged by friction, including a rubber comb through hair, and a balloon on a sweater. In both these instances, the electrons move from the second object to the first, causing the first object to become negatively charged and the second one positively charged. Friction between the tires on a moving car and the road cause the tires to become charged, and wind causes friction between clouds and air which causes clouds to become charged and can result in tremendous bolts of lightning.","target":"more","rationale":"The answer is that the clouds in Smallville have more electrons than those in Klangton.

Savory mousse may be flavored with hard boiled egg, herbs, fish or liver.\\n\\n- Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction.\\n\\n- A barrel, cask, or tun is a hollow cylindrical container, traditionally made of wooden staves bound by wooden or metal hoops.

Under 100 words is a good title length.\\n\\nCoronaviruses and arteriviruses, members of the order Nidovirales, are positive strand RNA viruses that encode large replicase polyproteins that are processed by viral proteases to generate the nonstructural proteins which mediate viral RNA synthesis. The viral papain-like proteases (PLPs) are critical for processing the amino-terminal end of the replicase and are attractive targets for antiviral therapies. With the analysis of the papain-like protease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), came the realization of the multifunctional nature of these enzymes. Structural and enzymatic studies revealed that SARS-CoV PLpro can act as both a protease to cleave peptide bonds and also as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme to cleave the isopeptide bonds found in polyubiquitin chains. Furthermore, viral DUBs can also remove the protective effect of conjugated ubiquitin-like molecules such as interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). Extension of these studies to other coronaviruses and arteriviruses led to the realization that viral protease/DUB activity is conserved in many family members. Overexpression studies revealed that viral protease/DUB activity can modulate or block activation of the innate immune response pathway. Importantly, mutations that alter DUB activity but not viral protease activity have been identified and arteriviruses expressing DUB mutants stimulated higher levels of acute inflammatory cytokines after infection. Further understanding of the multifunctional nature of the Nidovirus PLP/DUBs may facilitate vaccine development. Here, we review studies describing the PLPs' enzymatic activity and their role in virus pathogenesis.","target":"Nidovirus papain-like proteases: multifunctional enzymes with protease, deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities","rationale":"My suggestion for an appropriate title is \\"Nidovirus papain-like proteases: multifunctional enzymes with protease, deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities\\".

Throughout Chinese history, old dynasties had always been replaced by new dynasties. The Xinhai Revolution, however, was the first to overthrow a monarchy completely and attempt to establish a republic to spread democratic ideas throughout China. Though in 1911 at the provisional government welcome ceremony, Sun Yat-sen said, \\"The revolution is not yet successful, the comrades still need to strive for the future.\\" . Since the 1920s, the two dominant parties-the KMT and PRC-see the Xinhai Revolution quite differently. Both sides recognize Sun Yat-sen as the Father of the Nation, but in Taiwan, they mean \\"Father of the Republic of China\\". On the mainland, Sun Yat-sen was seen as the man who helped bring down the Qing, a pre-condition for the Communist state founded in 1949. The PRC views Sun's work as the first step towards the real revolution in 1949, when the communists set up a truly independent state that expelled foreigners and built a military and industrial power. The father of New China is seen as Mao Zedong. In 1954, Liu Shaoqi was quoted as saying that the \\"Xinhai Revolution inserted the concept of a republic into common people\\". Zhou Enlai pointed out that the \\"Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing rule, ended 2000 years of monarchy, and liberated the mind of people to a great extent, and opened up the path for the development of future revolution.

A contractile vacuole is a type of vacuole that removes excess water from a cell. Freshwater protists, such as the paramecia shown in Figure below , have a contractile vacuole. The vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole. When the vacuole is full, it pushes the water out of the cell through a pore.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.","target":"mangoes","rationale":"The question is asking about the sugar content of mangoes and raspberries.

My wife is 46.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \\"make it work\\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhich leads me to today.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI don't like being with my wife.

We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI know I do. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online.

In this study, we investigated the role of 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) in the induction and development of intestinal inflammation using a mouse model of acute and chronic colitis and human patients with Crohn's disease (CD).\\", 'Acute colitis was induced through administration of dextran sodium sulfate to wild-type, 5-HT7R-deficient mice and hematopoietic bone marrow chimera. Chronic colitis was induced in interleukin 10-deficient mice. The role of 5-HT7R in gut inflammation was assessed using agonist/antagonist treatment. We investigated expression and distribution of 5-HT7R, extent of gut inflammation with magnetic resonance imaging and histological analysis, survival rate, and disease activity index. Finally, biopsies from the large intestine of patients with CD were analyzed.', 'Under basal conditions, 5-HT7R is expressed both in enteric neurons and CD11c cells of the large intestine. Expression of 5-HT7R significantly increased after induction of colitis in mice and in inflamed intestinal regions of patients with CD in CD11c/CD86 double-positive cells. Pharmacological blockade or genetic ablation of 5-HT7R resulted in increased severity of both acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, whereas receptor stimulation showed an anti-inflammatory effect. Analysis of bone marrow chimera indicated importance of 5-HT7R expressed by hematopoietic cells in intestinal inflammation.\\nAnswer: The 5-HT7R expressed on CD11c/CD86-positive myeloid cells modulates the severity of intestinal inflammation in an acute and chronic colitis and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as CD.","target":"Is serotonin 5-HT7 receptor critically involved in acute and chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract?","rationale":"The passage suggests that serotonin 5-HT7 receptor may be involved in acute and chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.

Pirro is currently the host of Fox News Channel's Justice with Judge Jeanine. She was the first female judge elected to the Westchester County Court prior to her election as the first female District Attorney of Westchester County. As District Attorney, Pirro gained considerable visibility in cases of domestic abuse and crimes against the elderly.\\n\\nIn November 1993, Pirro was elected Westchester County District Attorney; she was the first woman to hold that position. She was re-elected in 1997 and 2001. On May 23, 2005, Pirro announced that she would not seek re-election to a fourth term as Westchester County District Attorney.  On December 31, 1993--within hours of Pirro's midnight inauguration as District Attorney--Scripps newspaper heiress Anne Scripps Douglas was savagely bludgeoned in the head with a skull hammer by her estranged husband, Scott Douglas (who subsequently committed suicide by jumping off the Tappan Zee Bridge), as she slept in their Bronxville home. By the time police arrived, Scott Douglas had fled the scene, and Anne Scripps Douglas died in hospital on January 6. Pirro, already known as a passionate prosecutor of domestic violence cases, was a frequent presence in the media during the period between the murder and when Scott Douglas's body washed ashore in Riverdale in early March 1994. This increase in Pirro's national profile led to her surfacing as a frequent guest on network and cable television news in June 1994, when O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his ex-wife, appearing frequently as a talking head for Nightline, Larry King Live, and Geraldo.  Within months of taking office, Pirro undertook a costly renovation to the district attorney's facilities and expanded to an additional floor of the county courthouse. The largest expenses were a new kitchenette and a media room, costing $20,000, to assist Pirro's growing profile; additional expenditures also came to remodel her personal office with mahogany.  Pirro was the first female president of the New York State District Attorneys Association. Also while district attorney, she was appointed by then Governor George Pataki to chair the New York State Commission on Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board. Its report and recommendations resulted in legislation passing that enhanced protections of, and safeguards for, the victims of domestic abuse.  Pirro made her biggest procedural mistake as district attorney when she repeatedly refused to reopen the murder case of Jeffrey Deskovic. In 1990, Deskovic was falsely convicted of killing a 15-year-old girl and spent 16 years in prison before he was exonerated by DNA evidence. Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\\n\\nWhat state was she in when she was district attorney?","target":"New York State District Attorneys","rationale":"The answer to this question is actually \\"New York\\".

A summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing: triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions, and last not but not least, primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer. Consistent evidence is available indicating that HPV-triage with the Hybrid Capture(®) 2 assay (Qiagen Gaithersburg, Inc., MD, USA [previously Digene Corp.] (HC2) is more accurate (higher sensitivity, similar specificity) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal Pap smear results. Several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mRNA testing with the APTIMA(®) (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to HC2. In triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), HC2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology. The APTIMA(®) test is more specific than HC2 without showing a loss in sensitivity. Identification of DNA of HPV types 16 and/or 18, or RNA from the five most carcinogenic HPV types allow selecting women at highest risk for CIN3+ but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing. After conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer, HPV testing picks up more quickly, with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity, residual or recurrent high-grade CIN than follow-up cytology. Primary screening for hrHPV generally detects more CIN2, CIN3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or LSIL, but is less specific. Combined HPV and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy, in comparison with HPV testing only. Randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of CIN3+ and even of cancer, in women aged 30 years or older, who were at enrollment hrHPV DNA negative compared to those who were cytologically negative. The difference in cumulative risk of CIN3+ or cancer for double negative (cytology & HPV) versus only HPV-negative women is small. HC2, GP5+/6+ PCR (polymerase chain reaction), cobas(®) 4800 PCR (Roche Molecular Systems Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) and Real Time PCR (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening. The loss in specificity associated with primary HPV-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or HPV genotyping for HPV16 or 18. There exists a substantial evidence base to support that HPV testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology, in surveillance after treatment of CIN lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older. However, the possible advantages offered by HPV-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies.

Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts.\\" Both sides of the album begin with three shorter, hook-driven songs, which Stylus Magazine's Evan Chakroff said veer between progressive rock and post-punk styles.

Verlaine's guitar establishes the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd is heard playing dissonant melodies.

Here  the internal narrative is simply layered onto a new medium. It doesn’t work (although Emma Thompson’s performance makes it watchable).  Fiona Maye (Ms Thompson)  is a well-respected judge  arrives at home to  her  husband Jack (Stanley Tucci) telling  her  that he would like to have an affair  and that Fiona  if  she  cares about him  will tolerate it. This leads to the film’s single flashback: as  she  lays awake at night   her  imagination reaches back to happier times and to a moment of pure joy when he surprised  her  with a new piano. Unlike in “On Chesil Beach”  the flashback here adds little to illuminate their predicament: the viewer is still left guessing as to how  she  ended up married to an American professor  or what their love was like at its peak.\\nThe marriage crisis exacerbates another one  this time in  Fiona ’s working life.  She  specialises in extraordinarily hard cases involving children  often with a religious element.  Her  newest case is an urgent one: Adam  a 17-year-old Jehovah’s Witness with leukaemia  is refusing a blood transfusion that could save his life.  Fiona  must decide his corporeal and perhaps spiritual fate.  She  has been able to dispassionately dispatch such cases in the past  but since  her  husband’s disruption of their marriage   her  confidence is faltering.\\n Her  interest in the boy then  so steadfast in his own faith  is both professional and personal.  Fiona  takes the unusual step of visiting him in the hospital  and under Richard Eyre’s thoughtful direction  the camera offers extreme close-ups of both characters  allowing the audience to search their eyes for meaning.  Fiona  is looking for cracks in Adam’s guarded wall of faith. The viewer is looking for the real motive behind  hers .\\nUnfortunately  it never quite appears.  Her  judicial ruling comes suddenly  ending its fascinating inquiry into the nature of faith and connection before it has even begun. Adam lives but becomes disillusioned with his faith and begins stalking Fiona  trading one obsession for another. Mr Eyre seems to be looking for some of the same notes that worked so well for him in “Notes of a Scandal” (2006)  but this is not a lurid tale  and efforts to make it one—with wistful glances and tense  longing strings on the soundtrack—seem out of place.

That includes a $200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from $900,000 to $1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was $374,062, the report states. Newman also has a $5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing.

This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world.

In the first quarter, San Diego got off to a fast start with QB Philip Rivers getting a 2-yard TD run.  Immediately afterwards on the ensuing kickoff, rookie LB Brandon Siler returned a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, the Chargers increased its lead with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 26-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Broncos got their only score of the game with kicker Jason Elam getting a 30-yard field goal.  San Diego would end the half with Kaeding nailing 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Chargers continued their offensive revival with Rivers completing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates and a 15-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson.  In the fourth quarter, RB Michael Turner helped San Diego seal their easy victory with a 74-yard TD run. With the win, the Chargers improved to 2-3.

The Bears moved ahead by double digits later on when Mike Glennon found Adam Shaheen on a 2-yard pass to make it 14-7. This would be followed up by Connor Barth's 24-yard field goal to make it 17-7 at halftime.

It is defined as a constrained optimization problem which maximizes the information the representation has about the task, I(T;Y), while ensuring that a minimum level of compression r is achieved (i.e., I(X;T) <= r). For practical reasons the problem is usually solved by maximizing the IB Lagrangian for many values of the Lagrange multiplier, therefore drawing the IB curve (i.e., the curve of maximal I(T;Y) for a given I(X;Y)) and selecting the representation of desired predictability and compression. It is known when Y is a deterministic function of X, the IB curve cannot be explored and other Lagrangians have been proposed to tackle this problem (e.g., the squared IB Lagrangian). In this paper we (i) present a general family of Lagrangians which allow for the exploration of the IB curve in all scenarios; (ii) prove that if these Lagrangians are used, there is a one-to-one mapping between the Lagrange multiplier and the desired compression rate r for known IB curve shapes, hence, freeing from the burden of solving the optimization problem for many values of the Lagrange multiplier.","target":"We introduce a general family of Lagrangians that allow exploring the IB curve in all scenarios.

Cilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in unison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it helps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that sweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about $30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about $1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise...\\n\\nDecide whether \\"They moved , spent , and stored their money in irregular ways\\" is a valid answer to the following question: How did the attack plotters avoid detection?\\nAnswer yes or no.","target":"No","rationale":"The passage doesn't directly mention how the attack plotters avoided detection.
