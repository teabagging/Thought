Passage 1:Elphin has historically been an important market town and the diocesan centre for the Diocese of Elphin. St Patrick is believed to have visited Elphin, consecrated its first church and ordained its first bishop, Asicus (subsequently the patron saint of Elphin). Information supporting the visitation of St Patrick is to be found in two important memorials of early Irish hagiography, the Vita Tripartita of St Patrick, and the \\"Patrician Documents\\" in the Book of Armagh. On his missionary tour through Connacht in 434 or 435, St Patrick came to the territory of Corcoghlan, present day Elphin. The chief of that territory, a noble Druid named Ono, gave land and afterwards his castle or fort to St Patrick to found a church and monastery. The place, which had hitherto been called Emlagh-Ono (a derivation of its owners name) received the designation of Ail Finn, which means \\"rock of the clear spring\\". It derives from a story of St Patrick raising a large stone from a well opened by him in the land of Ono and placed on its margin. A copious stream of crystal water flowed from the well and continues to flow through Elphin to this day. St Patrick built a church called Tempull Phadruig (Patrick's church) and established an Episcopal See in Elphin. St Asicus remained as bishop of Elphin. St Patrick also founded an episcopal monastery or college at Elphin, believed to be one of the first monasteries founded by him. In pre-Reformation times, Elphin was host to a large number of religious orders and was a religious centre of international significance. This is supported by the appearance of Elphin in a number of pan-European maps in the Middle Ages. \\n Passage 2:Born in 1909 in the family of Orthodox princes Obolensky, from 1925 in exile in France, where, together with his father Nikolai Leonidovich Obolensky adopted Catholicism. He went to the Benedictines, where studied philosophy, and in 1943 he defended his doctoral degree from Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm in Rome. From 1935 he studied at Russicum. Ordained priest in 1940, Obolensky was sent to Paris, where he taught at Saint George Boarding in Meudon. He was also a member of the Congress of Russian Catholics in 1950 in Rome. Obolensky taught courses on the history of Russian literature and philosophy in Rome, Meudon and Bergamo. He worked as an expert on the Soviet Union in NATO. He was also author of books on the Soviet economy, translated the correspondence of Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, and the memoirs of Georgy Zhukov and was engaged in the Soviet dissident literature. He died in 1992 in Belgium, the home of his sister.\\n Passage 3:On 22 June 2018, Miller signed for League Two club Port Vale on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Manager Neil Aspin had previously tried to sign him at F.C. Halifax Town and Gateshead. He was unable to play in the club's 2018–19 pre-season friendlies because of an unresolved disciplinary issue with The Football Association. He scored a goal and won a penalty on his debut on the opening day of the new season on 4 August, helping the \\"Valiants\\" to record a 3–0 victory over Cambridge United at Vale Park. His strike – a direct free-kick which he also won himself – was listed in the Daily Mail as the League Two goal of the weekend. However he was dropped after failing to score in the rest of the month, though impressed coach Lee Nogan with his performances off the bench, who said Miller just needed to rebuild his confidence following the goal drought. Aspin then switched to a 3–4–3 / 5–4–1 formation, leaving Miller to compete with Ben Whitfield for a place at wide midfield. Miller fell out of first-team contention by November, leaving Aspin to comment that \\"you have to be perfectly honest, he has not done the job at the moment that I brought him to do and, like I say, he has to do better.\\" He was recalled to the first-team on 19 January, following an injury to Tom Pope, and scored his second league goal for the club to secure a 1–0 win at Crawley Town. However he was shown a straight red card in a 1–0 home defeat to Carlisle United seven days later. An injury to Pope saw new manager John Askey return Miller to the starting eleven on 9 March, and he doubled his league tally for the season with both Vale goals in a 2–1 win over promotion-chasing Mansfield Town; his performance saw him named on the EFL team of the week. He ended the campaign with six goals in 22 starts and 13 substitute appearances. His contract was terminated by mutual consent on 27 June, and the club refused to comment on the reasons behind his departure. Miller wrote on Twitter that he was \\"Sorry I didn't fulfill my potential but I've found the last two years very difficult. I hope I leave you with some good memories.\\"","target":"2","rationale":"Obolensky was born in the family of Orthodox princes Obolensky, which indicates that his family had been royalty of a country.

Born in New York City to Japanese parents, record producer Utada Teruzane and enka singer Abe Junko, Utada began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to Tokyo, as a result of her father's job. Eventually, a recording contract with Toshiba-EMI was signed and, under the stage name \\"Cubic U\\", Utada released her English-language debut album Precious in early 1998, but was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, her Japanese-language debut First Love was released and became an instant success.\\n\\nHer first singles compilation album Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 was released on March 31, 2004. It became the best-selling album of 2004 in Japan, making her the only solo or group artist to reach number 1 four times on the yearly charts. It was the first compilation album to reach number 1 in six years on the yearly charts, and the first compilation album to reach number 1 in twenty-six years by a female artist. Despite its success, the album received little promotion and no new material; moreover, it charted longer on the Oricon Albums chart longer than any other Utada release to date (over 2 years). The album sold over 2.575 million units in Japan, making it the 34th best-selling album ever in the country. A month later, on April 21, she released her only Japanese single in 2004, \\"Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro,\\" which topped the singles chart for two consecutive weeks and sold 365,000 units by the year's end and was also the main theme song for Casshern, directed by her then husband Kazuaki Kiriya.  In mid-2004, Utada moved back to New York, and began work on a new recording contract with Island Def Jam Music Group. On October 5, 2004, she released her North American English-language debut album, Exodus, under the name \\"Utada,\\" which was her new American-given artist title at the Universal Convention. It was released on September 9 in Japan, with a special booklet and housed in a cardboard slipcase. In an MTV interview, Utada said: \\"I don't think it's the music that I'm concerned about. It's obviously that I look really different and there really aren't any completely Asian people [who are popular singers in the U.S.] right now.\\" Exodus became Utada's fourth consecutive release to debut at number 1 and boast 500,000 copies in its first-week sales in Japan. American sales were not as successful, it reached number 160 in the US Billboard 200 chart; it however peaked at number 5 in the Heatseekers chart. \\"Easy Breezy\\" was released as the lead single in early August 2004, followed up by \\"Devil Inside\\" a month and two weeks later. And Utada became the cover of the Interview magazine June 2005 issue.  \\"Exodus '04\\" was released at the end of June 2005 and featured remixes from The Scumfrog, Richard Vission, JJ Flores and Peter Bailey. In the UK, Mercury added another 2 remixes for \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\" in the original album Exodus 04, titled \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man [Bloodshy & Avant Mix]\\" and \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man [Junior Jack Mix].\\" By the end of the year Utada was voted \\"Number 1 Favorite Artist of 2004\\" by Oricon's annual readers poll.  The fourth single from Exodus, \\"You Make Me Want to Be a Man\\", was released in October 2005 in the UK. \\"Devil Inside\\" became a club hit in the U.S. and topped the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Airplay charts.

He was one of the most popular American rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, with the Belmonts or with the Del Satins. He is best remembered for the singles \\"Runaround Sue\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", \\"Ruby Baby\\" and \\"Lovers Who Wander\\", among his other hits.\\n\\nBy the end of 1960, Dion had released his first solo album on Laurie, Alone with Dion, and the single \\"Lonely Teenager,\\" which rose to No. 12 in the US charts. The name on his solo releases was simply \\"Dion.\\" Follow-ups \\"Havin' Fun\\" and \\"Kissin' Game\\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with a new vocal group, the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \\"Runaround Sue,\\" stormed up the U.S. charts, reaching No. 1 in October 1961, and No. 11 in the UK, where he also toured. \\"Runaround Sue\\" sold over a million copies, achieving gold disc status.  For the next single, Laurie promoted the A-side, \\"The Majestic,\\" but it was the B-side, Maresca's \\"The Wanderer,\\" which received more radio play and climbed swiftly up the charts to reach No. 2 in the U.S. in February 1962 and No. 10 in the UK (the 1976 re-release made the UK Top 20). \\"The Wanderer\\" has been used in the post-apocalyptic role-playing game Fallout 4, both in-game and in a trailer of the same name released in 2015.  By the end of 1961, Dion had become a major star, touring worldwide and making an appearance in the Columbia Pictures musical film Twist Around the Clock. He followed with a string of singles - \\"Lovers Who Wander\\" (No. 3), \\"Little Diane\\" (No. 8), \\"Love Came to Me\\" (No. 10) - in 1962, several of which he wrote or co-wrote. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander.  At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records; he was the first rock and roll artist signed to the label, which was an anomaly considering that its then-A&R director, Mitch Miller, passionately loathed that particular genre of music. The first Columbia single, Leiber and Stoller's \\"Ruby Baby\\" (originally a hit for the Drifters) reached No. 2, while \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" and \\"Drip Drop\\" (another remake of a Drifters hit) both reached No. 6 in late 1963. (Dion also recorded an Italian version of \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" using the identical backup vocals.)

We performed a diagnostic meta-analysis to evaluate current evidence on the use of miRNA assays to diagnose BCa.   \\n METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published before March 31, 2015. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the overall test performance. Subgroup analyses were used to explore the between-study heterogeneity. Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test was used to test publication bias. We applied the software of RevMan 5.2 and Stata 11.0 to the meta-analysis.   \\n RESULTS A total of 23 studies from nine articles were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 719 patients and 494 controls. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.80) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.80), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 3.03 (95% CI, 2.50-3.67); negative likelihood ratio was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.27-0.42); and diagnostic odds ratio was 9.07 (95% CI, 6.35-12.95). The pooled AUC was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78-0.85). Subgroup analyses indicated that the multiple miRNAs assays and urine supernatant assays showed high accuracies in diagnosing BCa.   \\n CONCLUSION The miRNA assays may serve as potential noninvasive diagnostic tool for the detection of BCa. However, the clinical application of miRNA assays for BCa diagnosis still needs further validation by large prospective studies..

The purpose of their study was to evaluate current evidence regarding microRNA assays as diagnostic tools for bladder cancer (BCa).

He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, political, and economic theory. In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s and 80s while at Harvard Law School as part of the Critical Legal Studies movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015.\\n\\nThe beginning of Unger's academic career began with the books Knowledge and Politics and Law in Modern Society, published in 1975 and 1976 respectively. These works led to the co-founding of Critical Legal Studies (CLS) with Duncan Kennedy and Morton Horwitz. The movement stirred up controversy in legal schools across America as it challenged standard legal scholarship and made radical proposals for legal education. By the early 1980s, the CLS movement touched off a heated internal debate at Harvard, pitting the CLS scholars against the older, more traditional scholars.  Throughout much of the 1980s, Unger worked on his magnum opus, Politics: A Work In Constructive Social Theory, a three volume work that assessed classical social theory and developed a political, social, and economic alternative. The series is based on the premise of society as an artifact, and rejects the necessity of certain institutional arrangements. Published in 1987, Politics was foremost a critique of contemporary social theory and politics; it developed a theory of structural and ideological change, and gave an alternative account of world history. By first attacking the idea that there is a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another, e.g. feudalism to capitalism, it then built an anti-necessitarian theory of social change, theorizing the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another.  Unger devoted much of the following decades to further elaborating on the insights developed in Politics by working out the political and social alternatives. What Should Legal Analysis Become? (Verso, 1996) developed tools to reimagine the organization of social life. Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative (Verso, 1998) and What Should the Left Propose? (Verso, 2005) put forth alternative institutional proposals.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Roberto Mangabeira Unger","rationale":"The entity in the text should be Roberto Mangabeira Unger.

The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes. \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Psychiatric illness in diabetes mellitus.

Passage:Roosevelt came to office in 1929 as a reform Democrat, but with no overall plan. He tackled official corruption by dismissing Smith's cronies and renamed the New York Public Service Commission. He addressed New York's growing need for power through the development of hydroelectricity on the St. Lawrence River. He reformed the state's prison administration and built a new state prison at Attica. He had a long feud with Robert Moses, the state's most powerful public servant, whom he removed as Secretary of State but kept on as Parks Commissioner and head of urban planning. Moses was replaced with the Bronx's Democratic Boss Edward J. Flynn. When the Wall Street crash in October 1929 ushered in the Great Depression, Roosevelt started a relief system that later became the model for the New Deal's Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). Roosevelt followed President Herbert Hoover's advice and asked the state legislature for $20 million in relief funds, which he spent mainly on public works in the hope of stimulating demand and providing employment. Aid to the unemployed, he said, \\"must be extended by Government, not as a matter of charity, but as a matter of social duty.\\" In his first term, Roosevelt famously said, \\"The United States Constitution has proved itself the most marvelously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written.\\" He was referring to the belief he had that the Federal government would need to use more power in order to bring the country out of the Depression.","target":"b","rationale":"The question only asks for the date of birth of the \\"person\\" who had a long feud with FDR.

Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces,...","target":"Bacon","rationale":"In the above text, Francis Bacon is mentioned as a painter.\\n\\"\\"Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality,\\"\\" indicates that what comes next was done by him earlier on during his career.

Probability density functions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic models and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general stochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval decreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a \\"race\\" to infect him or her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors. Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition. Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive number in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for epidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis, opening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease epidemiology.","target":"Generation interval contraction and epidemic data analysis","rationale":"The title should be concise and capture the key ideas of the paper.

His corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), pressures Hopper to choose his handpicked stooge, while popular committees want a reformer, Henry Hill. The governor's children want him to select Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), the head of the Boy Rangers. Unable to make up his mind between Taylor's stooge and the reformer, Hopper decides to flip a coin. When it lands on edge and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith's accomplishments he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will please the people while his naivete will make him easy to manipulate. Junior Senator Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains), who was Smith's late father's friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan (Astrid Allwyn). At Senator Paine's home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith's naive and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith's reputation with ridiculous front page pictures and headlines branding him a bumpkin. To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who was the aide to Smith's predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building graft scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor political machine and supported by Senator Paine. Unwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor's influence. Through Paine, the machine in his state accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked by Paine's betrayal to defend himself, and runs away. Saunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a filibuster to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 24 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the true motives of the dam scheme. Yet none of the Senators are convinced. The constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor's machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith's home state, on Taylor's orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. An effort by the Boy Rangers to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor's minions. Although all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith's home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate (Harry Carey). Smith vows to press on until people believe him, but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with guilt, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide, but is stopped by other senators. When he is stopped, he bursts back into the Senate chamber, loudly confessing to the whole scheme; \\n Question: What was the designation of Sam Foley?","target":"u.s. senator","rationale":"There are two potential answers to the question: \\"u.s. senator\\" and \\"senator.\\" The latter is a shorter span, so it should be chosen as the answer."},{"source":"In this task you are given an anecdote.

A virtue is a trait or quality deemed to be morally good and thus is valued as a foundation of principle and good moral being. Personal virtues are characteristics valued as promoting collective and individual greatness. The opposite of virtue is vice.\\n\\n- Psychology is the study of behavior and mind, embracing all aspects of conscious and unconscious experience as well as thought. It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\\nPsychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy.\\nWhile psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range...\\n\\n- Feeling is the nominalization of the verb \\"to feel\\". The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch, such as \\"a feeling of warmth\\" and of sentience in general. In Latin, \\"sentire\\" meant to feel, hear or smell.\\nIn psychology, the word is usually reserved for the conscious subjective experience of emotion. Phenomenology and heterophenomenology are philosophical approaches that provide some basis for knowledge of feelings. Many schools of psychotherapy depend on the therapist achieving some kind of understanding of the client's feelings, for which methodologies exist. \\n\\n- Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people. Friendship is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an association. Friendship has been studied in academic fields such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles. A World Happiness Database study found that people with close friendships are happier.\\n\\n- Love is a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes that ranges from interpersonal affection (\\"I love my mother\\") to pleasure (\\"I loved that meal\\"). It can refer to an emotion of a strong attraction and personal attachment. It can also be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection\\"the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another\\". It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.\\n\\n- Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?\\n\\n- Emotion, in everyday speech, is any relatively brief conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure. Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition. Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation. In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events. For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid. Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition.\\n\\n- A disposition is an artificial habit, a preparation, a state of readiness, or a tendency to act in a specified way that may be learned.\\n\\n- Unrequited love or one - sided love is love that is not openly reciprocated or understood as such by the beloved . The beloved may not be aware of the admirer 's deep and strong romantic affection or consciously reject it . The Merriam Webster Online Dictionary defines unrequited as \`\` not reciprocated or returned in kind . '' Psychiatrist Eric Berne states in his book Sex in Human Loving that \`\` Some say that one - sided love is better than none , but like half a loaf of bread , it is likely to grow hard and moldy sooner . '' Others , however , like the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , considered that \`\` indispensable ... to the lover is his unrequited love , which he would at no price relinquish for a state of indifference . '' It can also be contrasted with redamancy or the act of reciprocal love .\\n\\n- Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. The term \\"ethics\\" derives from the Ancient Greek word  \\"ethikos\\", which is derived from the word  \\"ethos\\" (habit, \\"custom\\"). The branch of philosophy axiology comprises the sub-branches of ethics and aesthetics, each concerned with values.\\n\\n- Affection, attraction, infatuation, or fondness is a \\"disposition or state of mind or body\\" that is often associated with a feeling or type of love. It has given rise to a number of branches of philosophy and psychology concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being. \\"Affection\\" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of love, amounting to more than goodwill or friendship. Writers on ethics generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with \\"passion\\" as being free from the distinctively sensual element.\\n\\n- Kindness is a behavior marked by ethical characteristics, a pleasant disposition, and concern for others. It is known as a virtue, and recognized as a value in many cultures and religions (see ethics in religion). Aristotle, in Book II of his \\"Rhetoric\\", defines it as being \\"helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the person helped\\". Nietzsche argued that kindness and love are the \\"most curative herbs and agents in human intercourse\\". Kindness is considered to be one of the Knightly Virtues. In Meher Baba's teachings, God is synonymous with kindness: \\"God is so kind that it is impossible to imagine His unbounded kindness!\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'unrequited love'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- academic discipline\\n - acting\\n - addition\\n - anthropology\\n - argument\\n - association\\n - behavior\\n - bond\\n - book\\n - branch\\n - collective\\n - concern\\n - custom\\n - database\\n - degree\\n - emotion\\n - ethics\\n - good\\n - habit\\n - health\\n - human\\n - integral\\n - language\\n - learned\\n - may\\n - meal\\n - mother\\n - muscle\\n - number\\n - people\\n - perception\\n - person\\n - personality\\n - philosophy\\n - preparation\\n - psychotherapy\\n - quality\\n - range\\n - rapid\\n - reason\\n - relationship\\n - rhetoric\\n - social behavior\\n - speech\\n - state\\n - study\\n - term\\n - theory\\n - trait\\n - value\\n - variety\\n - verb\\n - virtue\\n - work","target":"emotion","rationale":"'Unrequited love' is 'a deep and strong romantic affection that is not openly reciprocated or understood as such by the beloved'.

They took Palermo on 7 July and then divided their army in two. De Lede followed the coast to besiege Messina between 18 July and 30 September, while the Duke of Montemar conquered the rest of the island. The French, Austrians, and British now demanded Spanish withdrawal from Sicily and Sardinia. The attitude of Victor Amadeus II of Savoy was ambiguous, as he agreed to negotiate with Cardinal Alberoni to form an anti-Austrian alliance. On 2 August 1718, Britain, France and Austria joined with the United Provinces of the Netherlands to form the Quadruple Alliance in the Treaty of London. On 11 August, at the Battle of Cape Passaro, a British fleet, led by Sir George Byng, effectively eliminated the Spanish fleet stationed off Sicily. This was followed in the autumn by the landing of a small Austrian army, assembled in Naples by the Austrian Viceroy Count Wirich Philipp von Daun, near Messina to lift the siege by the Spanish forces. The Austrians were defeated in the First Battle of Milazzo on 15 October, and only held a small bridgehead around Milazzo. In 1718, Cardinal Alberoni began plotting to replace the Duc d'Orléans, regent to the 5-year old King Louis XV of France, with Philip V. This plot became known as the Cellamare Conspiracy. After the plot was discovered, Alberoni was expelled from France, which declared war on Spain. By 17 December 1718, the French, British, and Austrians had all officially entered the war against Spain.

Most regularization techniques are conceptualized and implemented in the space of parameters. However, it is also possible to regularize in the space of functions. Here, we propose to measure networks in an $L^2$ Hilbert space, and test a learning rule that regularizes the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space each update.   This approach is inspired by the slow movement of gradient descent through parameter space as well as by the natural gradient, which can be derived from a regularization term upon functional change. The resulting learning rule, which we call Hilbert-constrained gradient descent (HCGD), is thus closely related to the natural gradient but regularizes a different and more calculable metric over the space of functions. Experiments show that the HCGD is efficient and leads to considerably better generalization.","target":"It's important to consider optimization in function space, not just parameter space.

GÃ©rard saw his sister kissing d'Artagnan goodbye or as d'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\" At Musketeer Headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the Cardinal's Guards have disbanded the Musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England.

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form.\\n\\nOf course, questions of how long do hard boiled eggs last in the fridge and how long are boiled eggs good for depend upon proper storage. But remember, eggs, like a lot of other dairy products (actually eggs are technically classified as animal products… but, since they are purchased in the dairy section of stores we listed them under dairy), usually have a sell by date and not a use by date. Hard boiling eggs can make eggs transportable as a snack on the go or part of a packed lunch. Storing either raw or hard boiled eggs properly is important for food quality and safety concerns. Both raw and hard boiled eggs should be stored in the refrigerator. How long raw and hard boiled eggs last in the fridge Even though some refrigerators have built in egg shelves on the refrigerator door, eggs should be kept inside the refrigerator. Eggs should be kept at 40 degrees or lower, so if they are stored in the inside of the refrigerator they are more likely to stay at a constant temperature. Interesting Facts about Hard Boiled Egg Shelf Life: 1  The term hard boiled eggs is actually misleading because eggs should never be subjected to a hard rigorous boil, it should be a soft gentle boil. 2  Salmonella is killed by the heat of cooking (once the yolk and white are both firm). 3  Boiling removes the protective coating on the egg shell. Refrigerator Storage: Refrigerate eggs at 40°F or less. Store them in their original carton on an inside shelf and away from pungent foods. The temperature on an inside shelf remains more constant than one on the door, which is opened and closed frequently. After hard boiling eggs, they should be stored in the refrigerator as well. According to the American Egg Board, hard boiled shelled eggs can last up to one week if they have been kept in the refrigerator. If hard boiled eggs are peeled, eat them the same day as when they are peeled. Interesting Facts about Hard Boiled Egg Shelf Life: 1  The term hard boiled eggs is actually misleading because eggs should never be subjected to a hard rigorous boil, it should be a soft gentle boil. A more proper term for hard boiled eggs is hard cooked eggs, although that is less common. Raw eggs that have been removed from their shells should be refrigerated in a tightly covered container. Refrigerated whole egg yolks should be covered with water to prevent them from drying out; drain before using. The following chart shows how long hard-boiled eggs and raw eggs last when stored in the refrigerator. Defrost frozen eggs overnight in the refrigerator. Egg yolks thicken (or gel) when frozen. To hinder gel formation, beat in either 1/8 teaspoon salt or 1-1/2 teaspoons sugar or corn syrup per ¼ cup yolks (4 Large) before freezing. Indicate “with salt” (main dishes) or “with sugar” (desserts) on the label. The following chart shows how long hard-boiled eggs and raw eggs last when stored in the freezer. Eggs: Refrigerator (35°F to 40°F) Raw whole eggs (in shell) 4 to 5 weeks beyond the pack date or about 3 weeks after purchase: Raw whole eggs (slightly beaten) Up to 2 days: Raw egg whites: Up to 4 days: Raw egg yolks: Up to 2 days: Hard-boiled eggs (in shell) Up to 1 week: Hard-boiled eggs (peeled) Use the same day for best quality Freezer Storage: If you have more eggs than you can use within a few weeks, you can freeze them, out of their shells. How Long Do Hard Boiled Eggs Last? How long do hard boiled eggs last? Hard boiled eggs last about 7 days in the fridge, but can spoil quicker if not handled properly. Hard boiled eggs are fresh whole eggs that have been boiled for about 10 minutes. Chicken eggs are the most commonly used choice for hard boiling. Because of their relatively low-cost, high protein, versatility and portability hard boiled eggs are a popular protein choice.

The high variance problem is particularly exasperated in problems with long horizons or high-dimensional action spaces. To mitigate this issue, we derive a bias-free action-dependent baseline for variance reduction which fully exploits the structural form of the stochastic policy itself and does not make any additional assumptions about the MDP. We demonstrate and quantify the benefit of the action-dependent baseline through both theoretical analysis as well as numerical results, including an analysis of the suboptimality of the optimal state-dependent baseline. The result is a computationally efficient policy gradient algorithm, which scales to high-dimensional control problems, as demonstrated by a synthetic 2000-dimensional target matching task. Our experimental results indicate that action-dependent baselines allow for faster learning on standard reinforcement learning benchmarks and high-dimensional hand manipulation and synthetic tasks. Finally, we show that the general idea of including additional information in baselines for improved variance reduction can be extended to partially observed and multi-agent tasks.","target":"Action-dependent baselines can be bias-free and yield greater variance reduction than state-only dependent baselines for policy gradient methods","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nAction-dependent baselines can be bias-free and yield greater variance reduction than state-only dependent baselines for policy gradient methods."},{"source":"DIALOG:\\nWhat was the result of the 2013 film adaptation of the Ukrainian film Skolky i znas'?\\n- Air date: 29 June 2013 For coming last on the previous leg, Alexey & Olena had to gather 50 people in the market square and have them perform the wave.\\n- What is a highlight of the film adaptation of Velyki Perehony?\\n- In this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to snow tube down a hill, memorizing a series of flags from the countries they visited on the way down.\\n- What did the teams do next after the film adaptation?\\n- At the bottom, they would have to arrange them in the correct order to receive their next clue.\\n- Did the detour change from the original plan?\\n- In the Detour, teams chose between (\\"Hlechyk\\" – Pot) and (\\"Harbuz\\" – Pumpkin).\\n- What did the teams do in the detour?\\n-","target":"In Hlechyk, teams had to knock down six clay pots using a whip.","rationale":"The second sentence in the DIALOG refers to a detour.

Although her mother was Egyptian, Diana considers herself part of the British upper class. At the station, she is noticed by Jamil El Shehab, a handsome good-natured Egyptian dragoman who enjoys romancing women tourists and freeing them from some of their jewelry. Jamil is immediately captivated by Diana and soon talks his way into becoming her official guide and driver in Egypt.\\nWhile touring the Pyramids, Jamil manages to be alone with Diana and romances her with love songs. Meanwhile, Diana is also being wooed by Pasha Achmed, her fiancé's unscrupulous Egyptian business associate. In order to arrange to be alone with Diana, Pasha persuades Gerald to leave Cairo and inspect the aqueduct they are building together. When Jamil learns of the deception, he blackmails his countryman to remain silent. Later Jamil uses his position as a servant to enter Diana's hotel bedroom, and kisses her in a moment of passion. Although she briefly returns his kiss, Diana angrily fires him.\\nSoon after, she and Gerald set out on a caravan across the desert with a new guide. Undaunted by Diana's rejection, Jamil follows and soon replaces the new guide. That night, Jamil's romantic singing has its effect on Diana, who is drawn into his arms again. When she realizes what is happening, she is outraged and strikes Jamil with a whip. On their way back to Cairo, however, Jamil sends the rest of the caravan on one route and tricks Diana into riding to Pasha's oasis retreat, where she is treated like royalty.

His next single \\"Wishing on a Star\\" peaked at number 13 in UK being his highest peak on the chart until Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem). The next single \\"The City Is Mine was the most successful single of In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and it received positive reviews from critics. In 1998 he released the smash hit singles \\"Can I Get A...\\" and \\"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\\" which peaked at number 19 and 15 on the Hot 100 and had wide success worldwide, too. The singles helped the album Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life to debut at number 1 on the Albums chart and selling over 5 million copies. Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter had hits like \\"Jigga My Nigga\\" which peaked at number 1 on the Rap chart and #28 on the Hot 100. Hits like \\"Girl's Best Friend\\" and \\"Big Pimpin'\\" were released and the later peaked at #18 on the Hot 100 earning a platinum certification by the RIAA.

We conducted a series of phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses to study the evolution dynamics of MERS-CoV among different host species with genomic data. Our analyses show: 1) 28 potential recombinant sequences were detected and they can be classified into seven potential recombinant types; 2) The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV was under strong positive selection when Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel beta-coronavirus with high pathogenicity, which imposes a serious threat to human health 1 . Substantial evidence has showed that MERS-CoVs have existed in central and east Africa for decades 2,3 , and have many natural hosts including two species of bats (Neoromicia capensis and Vespertilio superans), dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius), and European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) 4-7 . Yet it seemed that human MERS-CoV first isolated in Saudi Arabian in 2012, and then spread among humans worldwide 8 . Studies of prototype human MERS-CoV also suggested that the tMRCA (the time of most recent common ancestor) of human MERS-CoV can be traced back to about 2011 9 . Because the genome sequence of bat MERS-CoV is highly identical to that of human MERS-CoV, it has been indicated that human MERS-CoV might have a bat origin 10 , while there is also some evidence of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission 11,12 . Together, these studies proposed that zoonotic event may play a nontrivial part in MERS-CoV evolution and transmission. Previous studies showed that recombination was common among the members of beta-coronavirus 13,14 . By joining the previously unlinked DNA, recombination event can create new viral strains which may be capable of infecting new hosts and evading host's immuno-responses. The phylogenetic analysis showed that there were two main MERS-CoV clades-clade A and B, and clade B can be further divided into five phylogenetic groups 15 . There is evidence that recombination event had happened between group III and group V 15 . However, whether there was potential recombination event happened between the other groups or among multiple phylogenetic groups remains unclear. The genome of MERS-CoV is over 30,000 nucleotides (nt) in length, which contains seven predicted open reading frames (ORFs) and four structural genes-spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) 16 (supplementary Fig. 1c ). The surface located spike (S) protein of beta-coronaviruses is one of the major determinants in their cross-species transmission because it mediates the virus-receptor recognition and thereby activates viral infection process 17 . Additionally, the receptor binding domain (RBD) on S protein's N-terminal is the key element for beta-coronavirus entering into host cells and the mutations in coronavirus's RBD affects its infection and cross-species capability 18, 19 . For example, the study of the spike protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), another beta-coronavirus with high pathogenicity, revealed four amino","target":"Evolutionary Dynamics of MERS- CoV: Potential Recombination, Positive Selection and Transmission OPEN","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nEvolutionary Dynamics of MERS- CoV: Potential Recombination, Positive Selection and Transmission OPEN"},{"source":"Information:\\n\\n- Kentucky Route 686 ( KY 686 ) is a 6.333 - mile ( 10.192 km ) state highway around the city of Mount Sterling , Kentucky .

Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States.\\n\\n- Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.\\n\\n- A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'kentucky route 686' with the relationship of 'owned by'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- city\\n - connecticut\\n - hampshire\\n - kentucky\\n - kentucky transportation cabinet\\n - new york city\\n - rhode island\\n - united states of america\\n - virginia","target":"kentucky transportation cabinet","rationale":"The question asks about the entity that is related to 'kentucky route 686' with the relationship of 'owned by'.

Interaction with other students allows students to have better social approaches when interacting.

Some cultures have developed entire belief systems around favored animals. Even in cultures with less formal belief systems, connections between people and animals still lead to commonly accepted opinions about animals.\\nThese belief systems usually develop around the animals that interact   with humans most frequently. Therefore, it should not be surprising that so many stories surround the most common of animals: rats. Rats live side by side with humans all over the world and regularly interact with people. Human-rat coexistence may be common all around the world, but different cultures respond to that closeness in different ways.\\nIn the United States and Europe, one typical attitude is that the rat is a pest. This could be due to the common belief that rats spread disease. Actually, they don't, at least not directly, but many people don't know that. The Pied Piper of Hamlin, a well-known children's story, is one example of how rats have been described in Western literature: in that story, rats cause such a problem that a town has to hire a piper to call them all away.\\nIn many Latin American countries, the rat is described in a very different way. The story of the tooth fairy (a fairy believed by children to leave money while they sleep in exchange for a tooth that has come out) is common all over the world, but in Latin America, the \\"fairy\\" is a rat! Rats do have very strong teeth, which could explain the association. Clearly, this shows another attitude toward rats that is much more positive.\\nYet another attitude toward the rat can be seen in the Chinese Zodiac  . The Rat is one of the animals of the Zodiac. Like the other zodiac animals, the Rat is neither entirely good nor entirely bad. It's described as clever and friendly, but also tricky and not entirely honest. That may be the most accurate description of the rat so far.

Sultan Murad I took Adrianople from the Byzantines in 1362; Sofia fell in 1382, followed by Shumen in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. The Russian Empire also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774.\\nThe Western European Enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of Bulgaria.

He once made a new hire, an 18 year old kid, quit his first job, on the first day, by screaming at him for what seemed like forever, but was probably only a couple of minutes. I’m talking spit flying, jabbing him in the chest with his fingers, like if Gordon Ramsay looked like Guy Fieri, and acted like Leona Helmsley. \\n\\nHe once got on a fork lift and in a fit of rage rammed into a pallet at speed, sending its contents flying, then demanded that my coworker clean it up, alone, because he “shouldn’t have left this lift there.” It wasn’t his lift, and he’s not even a lift operator. \\n\\nHe’s temperamental, rude, angry, selfish, and a bully. He’s a bad boss, and a terrible person. He demanded to be added to our work’s group chat, and then started flooding it with messages bragging about all the “super young pussy” he gets. Someone once made the mistake of telling him that none of us believed him. So instead he started sending us nude pictures of the girls that he takes home. Most of the time the girls in question are clearly sleeping in the photos, meaning they probably have no idea these pictures have been taken. Furthermore, I’m 29 and I would go nowhere near these girls. If they’re 20 years old I’d be surprised. Did I mention that he’s a 50 something year old married man.

I have saved every shitty vulgar text message he has ever sent me, and after about a year working there I started keeping a journal of all the times he flipped out.

This, I don’t feel bad about, I honestly doubt anything will happen to him in terms of losing his job or being disciplined.\\n\\nI have also thought about sending a collection of his text messages to his wife. This is what I’m iffy about. I told a close friend my plan and he called me an ass hole. He said it’s not my business, and for all I know that’s their arrangement.

The members of the Polar Bear Club at Coney Island , New York are usually about the age of 60. Members must satisfy two requirements.

Some are worried about the dangers of a condition in which the body's temperature drops so low that finally the heart stops. Other doctors, however, point out that there is more danger of a heart attack during summer swimming because the difference between the air temperature and water temperature is much greater in summer than in winter.\\nThe Polar Bears themselves are satisfied with the benefits(or advantages) of cold-water swimming. They say that their favorite form of exercise is very good for the circulatory system  because it forces the blood to move fast to keep the body warm.

And it becomes worse when they answer you back. Scientists tell us that children should be treated with care. Yes, sure they should respect their elders.\\nWe are partly responsible  for this. At an early age we encourage children to behave like adults, just because we find it funny. The kids on the other hand consider this same behavior as normal and get used to it. And when it is not funny for us any more, we expect them to stop it, but by then it is already too late.

Thus Władysław began redirecting his reinforcements to that theater. Later that year, the Commonwealth forces under Stanisław Koniecpolski scored a victory in the south, ending a war against the Ottomans. Both sides introduced new tactics, units and equipment based on Western models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors that kept the Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War . After the war, Władysław gave the Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping to persuade the Tsar to join in an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the king was ultimately unable to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, unable to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing. The war cost the Commonwealth treasury about 4,300,000 zloties.

It's not that crowded either because it was past the lunch rush at around 2.\\n\\nI was standing in line, minding my own business with 3 people ahead of me. Of course, like any civilized and polite member of society, I was leaving a bit of breathing room between me and the person in front of me. To be fair, I usually leave an extra 6 inches or foot, just because I don't want to invade anyone's bubble of personal space and vice versa.\\n\\nIf it's crowded, sure, I'll bite the bullet and squeeze in, but like I said, there was plenty of room. No banisters or barriers or anything, just a checkout and about 30-40 feet in all directions, bordered by a cafeteria line behind, and two seating areas to the sides.\\n\\nAnd I could sense a basket come up behind me. It was a little too close and not directly behind me, but to the side, so that I could see it in my peripheral vision without moving my head. I didn't pay any attention because I am just reading on my phone and patiently waiting.\\n\\nSo the first guy is checked out and leaves and the next one is up, with a lady in front of me waiting. So I shuffled my feet a bit forward, but not really too much, just to sort of get away from the basket who was directly behind me.\\n\\nAnd that is when I heard it. Right behind me, *very* loudly and rudely, an older man (70ish) says to me, \\"Are you in this lane?\\" His tone and volume really just struck me the wrong way.

Released in 2001, the POWER4 succeeded the POWER3 and RS64 microprocessors, and was used in RS/6000 and AS/400 computers, ending a separate development of PowerPC microprocessors for the AS/400. The POWER4 was a multicore microprocessor, with two cores on a single die, the first non-embedded microprocessor to do so. POWER4 Chip was first commercially available multiprocessor chip. The original POWER4 had a clock speed of 1.1 and 1.3 GHz, while an enhanced version, the POWER4+, reached a clock speed of 1.9 GHz. The PowerPC 970 is a derivative of the POWER4.\\n\\n- The POWER5 is a microprocessor developed and fabricated by IBM. It is an improved version of the POWER4. The principal improvements are support for simultaneous multithreading (SMT) and an on-die memory controller. The POWER5 is a dual-core microprocessor, with each core supporting one physical thread and two logical threads, for a total of two physical threads and four logical threads.\\n\\n- A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.\\n\\n- The memory controller is a digital circuit that manages the flow of data going to and from the computer's main memory. A memory controller can be a separate chip or integrated into another chip, such as being placed on the same die or as an integral part of a microprocessor; in the latter case, it is usually called an integrated memory controller (IMC). A memory controller is sometimes also called a memory chip controller (MCC) or a memory controller unit (MCU).\\n\\n- Ravi Arimilli ( born 1963 ) is an IBM Fellow and Chief Architect .

Booth visited the boarding house many times over the next few months, sometimes at Mary's request.  George Atzerodt and Lewis Powell boarded at the townhouse for short periods.

Peak values at 24-48 hours following the last class ranged from 90 to 3473 U/liter, or 1.55 to 34.71 times resting values.

The image provided no citations to substantiate the information it presented, and the notion that opossums were a possible tool in the epidemiological battle against Lyme disease seemed implausible to some. As it turned out, there is at least some truth to the opossum-as-tick-slayer rumors. On 18 April 2014, the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and NewsTimes published an article that focused on the role of opossums in the spread of Lyme disease with respect to their role in the ecosystem: [N]ow ecologists have learned something else about opossums. They’re a sort of magnet when it comes to riding the world of black-legged ticks, which spread Lyme disease. “Don’t hit opossums if they’ve playing dead in the road,” said Richard Ostfeld, of the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. Ostfeld is forest ecologist and an expert on the environmental elements of infectious diseases like Lyme disease. Several years ago, scientists … tested six species — white-footed mice, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums and veerys and catbirds — by capturing and caging them, and then exposing each test subject to 100 ticks … [O]f the six, the opossums were remarkably good at getting rid of the ticks — much more so that any of the others. [A]mong other opossum traits, there is this: They groom themselves fastidiously, like cats. If they find a tick, they lick it off and swallow it … Extrapolating from their findings, Ostfeld said, the team estimated that in one season, an opossum can kill about 5,000 ticks … Some ticks end up getting their blood meal from the possum. But more than 90 percent of them ended up being groomed away and swallowed. “They’re net destroyers of ticks,” Ostfeld said. Ostfeld had previously discouraged disruption of opossum populations for this reason. In July 2012, he said in a podcast: Because many ticks try to feed on opossums and few of them survive the experience. Opossums are extraordinarily good groomers it turns out — we never would have thought that ahead of time — but they kill the vast majority — more than 95% percent of the ticks that try to feed on them. So these opossums are walking around the forest floor, hoovering up ticks right and left, killing over 90% of these things, and so they are really protecting our health. Ostfeld was also named as one author of a September 2009 study in Proceedings of the Royal Society which examined animal kingdom hosts “as ecological traps for the vector of Lyme disease” and asserted that: By subjecting field-caught hosts to parasitism by larval blacklegged ticks, we found that some host species (e.g. opossums, squirrels) that are abundantly parasitized in nature kill 83–96% of the ticks that attempt to attach and feed, while other species are more permissive of tick feeding. [T]he vast majority (96.5%) of larval ticks that encounter an opossum and attempt to feed are apparently consumed. Working backwards, [we calculate that] during any given week in the larval activity peak, each opossum must host more than 5500 larval ticks to produce 199 that successfully feed. By this logic, during the larval peak, each mouse encounters approximately 50 larval ticks per week, almost half of which feed to repletion and become nymphs. As far as “amazing facts” images go, the opossum/Lyme disease one was very well researched, with numbers that matched up with what ecologists have learned about opossums, deer ticks, and the spread of Lyme disease in recent years (although those studies surmised opossums kill approximately 5,000 ticks per season, not per week). Claim: Opossums kill thousands of ticks each week, inhibiting the spread of Lyme Disease to humans.","target":"2","rationale":"The entire passage talks about how opossums inhibit the spread of Lyme disease.

The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown (\\"Scary Spice\\"), Melanie Chisholm (\\"Sporty Spice\\"), Emma Bunton (\\"Baby Spice\\"), Geri Halliwell (\\"Ginger Spice\\"), and Victoria Beckham, nee Adams (\\"Posh Spice\\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history.\\n\\nThe phrase \\"girl power\\" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase itself had also appeared in a few songs by British girl groups and bands since at least 1987; most notably, it was the name of British pop duo Shampoo's 1996 single and album, later credited by Halliwell as the inspiration for the Spice Girls' mantra.  However, it was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with \\"Wannabe\\", that the concept of \\"girl power\\" exploded onto the common consciousness. The phrase was regularly uttered by all five members--although most closely associated with Halliwell--and was often delivered with a peace sign. The slogan also featured on official Spice Girls merchandise and on some of the outfits the group members wore. The Spice Girls' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women, and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females.  In all, the focused, consistent presentation of \\"girl power\\" formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism--popularized as \\"girl power\\"--in the 1990s, with their mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans. On the other hand, some critics dismissed it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters. Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the Oxford English Dictionary. In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, \\"The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.\\"  The Spice Girls' debut single \\"Wannabe\\" has been hailed as an \\"iconic girl power anthem\\". In 2016, the United Nations' Global Goals \\"#WhatIReallyReallyWant\\" campaign filmed a global remake of the original music video for \\"Wannabe\\" to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which was launched on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally, featured British girl group M.O, Canadian \\"viral sensation\\" Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world. In response to the remake, Beckham said, \\"How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls' girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?\\"  At the 43rd People's Choice Awards in January 2017, American actress Blake Lively dedicated her \\"Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress\\" award to \\"girl power\\" in her acceptance speech, and credited the Spice Girls, saying: \\"What was so neat about them was that they're all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power.\\"\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Spice Girls","rationale":"The entire passage is about the Spice Girls.

Passage 1:Jenkins was born in Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan on 30 January 1828. His father, William David Jenkins, could allegedly trace his ancestry back to Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last Prince of Morgannwg. After attending Taliesin Williams's school in Merthyr Tydfil and Cowbridge Grammar School, Jenkins studied at Oxford University, matriculating at Jesus College in 1846 with the benefit of the Sir Leoline Jenkins scholarship. He studied Literae Humaniores, obtaining a third-class BA degree in 1850. He subsequently obtained further degrees: M.A. in 1852, BD in 1859 and DD in 1871. He became a good classical and oriental scholar whilst at Oxford, developing a fluency in modern languages in later life. Whilst an undergraduate, he tried and failed on several occasions for the Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew Scholarship; after his final failure, Dr Pusey presented him with some books to acknowledge his abilities in Hebrew.\\n Passage 2:The Sweden national football team has traditionally been a strong team in international football, with eleven World Cup appearances—collecting one silver and two bronze medals—and three medals in the Olympics, including one gold. Sweden played its first international game against Norway in 1908 and competed in an international tournament, the Summer Olympics, for the first time the same year. Since then, Sweden has regularly qualified for the World Cup and the Olympics as well as the European Championships. The best results in the World Cup are a second place (as hosts) in the 1958 and two third places in 1950 and 1994. In the Olympics, Sweden has won the gold medal in 1948 as well as two bronze medals in 1924 and 1952.

He finished fourth in his group at the round-robin stage, and although he did not progress to the next round, he did beat former world champion and world number one Stephen Hendry 3–0. At the UK Championship, he lost in the second round of qualifying to Jamie Burnett 7–9. In the following ranking event, the Malta Cup, he lost to Joe Jogia 3–5, again in the second round of qualifying.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \\nHow many people are being freed? \\nI was going to say \\"More than 2,900\\".

She has won several awards, including seven Filmfare Awards. Her film roles have been cited as a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in Hindi cinema. Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film.\\n\\nRani Mukerji was born in Mumbai on 21 March 1978. Her father, Ram Mukherjee (born to the Mukherjee-Samarth family), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios. Her mother, Krishna Mukherjee, is a former playback singer. Her elder brother, Raja Mukherjee, is a film producer and director. Her maternal aunt, Debashree Roy, is a Bengali film actress and her paternal cousin, Kajol, is a Hindi film actress and her contemporary. Another paternal cousin, Ayan Mukerji, is a scriptwriter and film director. Despite her parents and most of her relatives being members of the Indian film industry, Mukerji was uninterested in pursuing a career in film. She said, \\"There were already too many actresses at home and I wanted to be someone different\\".  Mukerji received her education at Maneckji Cooper High School in Juhu and graduated with a degree in Home Science from SNDT Women's University. She is a trained Odissi dancer and began learning the dance form while in the tenth grade. As part of an annual tradition, the Mukherjee family celebrates the festival of Durga Puja in the suburban neighbourhood of Santacruz every year. Mukerji, a practising Hindu, takes part in the festivities with her entire family.  In 1994, director Salim Khan approached her to play the lead female role in his directorial, Aa Gale Lag Jaa. Her father disapproved of a full-time career in film at such a young age, so she rejected the offer. At the age of eighteen, Mukerji experimented with acting by portraying a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film Biyer Phool (1996). The film starred Prosenjit and Indrani Haldar in lead roles and narrates the story of two sisters; Mukerji played the younger sibling of Haldar's character. Soon after, Khan approached her with another film offer to play the protagonist of the social drama Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, Mukerji accepted the role due to her mother's insistence that she continue to pursue acting on an experimental basis. Before she began work on the film, Mukerji trained at Roshan Taneja's acting institute.\\n\\nWhat year did she begin acting with her father?","target":"1996","rationale":"The passage mentions that Mukerji's first appearance was in her father's Bengali language film Biyer Phool.

The city was the centre of rangaku, the study of Western science, and it was here that physicians Jan Karel van den Broek and J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort were instrumental in teaching their Japanese students not only medicine but also chemistry and photography. Neither Van den Broek nor Pompe van Meerdervoort was an experienced photographer, and their attempts to produce photographs were largely failures. Nevertheless, in turn they taught wet-collodion process photography to Keisai Yoshio, Furukawa Shumpei, Kawano Teizō, Maeda Genzō, Ueno Hikoma, and Horie Kuwajirō, among others.On his arrival in Japan, Rossier presumably introduced himself as a photographer despatched to Japan by Negretti and Zambra, perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception, for while he remained in the country he was often referred to as an \\"English\\" photographer. In Nagasaki, Rossier was assisted in his work by Maeda Genzō, who had been instructed to accompany the \\"Englishman\\" and to further learn photography. With Maeda and other students escorting him around the city, Rossier took photographs of priests, beggars, the audience of a sumo match, the foreign settlement, and the group portrait of Alexander von Siebold and samurai. Rossier believed that Pompe van Meerdervoort's failures in photography were due to a lack of the necessary chemicals and so he provided Maeda with a letter of recommendation to procure photographic apparatus and chemicals from a source in Shanghai. Both Maeda and Furukawa bought lenses, chemicals and albumen paper through Rossier.At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also received photographic instruction from Rossier.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\\n\\nContext: Both you and the speck of dust consist of atoms of matter. So does the ground beneath your feet. In fact, everything you can see and touch is made of matter. The only things that arent matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume. Mass is the amount of matter in a substance or object. Mass is commonly measured with a balance. A simple mechanical balance is shown in Figure 3.1. It allows an object to be matched with other objects of known mass. SI units for mass are the kilogram, but for smaller masses grams are often used instead. The more matter an object contains, generally the more it weighs. However, weight is not the same thing as mass. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling on an object. It is measured with a scale, like the kitchen- scale in Figure 3.2. The scale detects how forcefully objects in the pan are being pulled downward by the force of gravity. The SI unit for weight is the newton (N). The common English unit is the pound (lb). With Earths gravity, a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N (2.2 lb). Problem Solving Problem: At Earths gravity, what is the weight in newtons of an object with a mass of 10 kg? Solution: At Earths gravity, 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N. Therefore, 10 kg has a weight of (10 9.8 N) = 98 N. You Try It! Problem: If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force, so mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes, even while the mass of the object remains constant. Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon, in Figure 3.3. An astronaut weighed less on the moon than he did on Earth because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. Thats because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An \\"empty\\" liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an \\"empty\\" room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l w h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used to measure volume. You can see how it works in Figure 3.4 and in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements. Matter has many properties. Some are physical properties. Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to a different substance. For example, whether a given substance normally exists as a solid, liquid, or gas is a physical property. Consider water. It is a liquid at room temperature, but if it freezes and \\n Question: amount of space taken up by matter","target":"volume","rationale":"The answer is \\"volume\\"."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences where the second sentence is missing.

The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials.

This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.\\n\\nParagraph: Big town and Fair town both used petroleum products. Big town used them to make plastics and related materials, but didn't use it for gas, because they were environmentally conscious and used only electric vehicles for transportation.

The iPhone 6S incorporates a second-generation Touch ID sensor that is up to twice as fast as the first-generation sensor found in the 5S, 6, and SE phones. As of October 2018, the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus, 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro, iPad Pro 10.5 and 12.9 (second generation), and 2018 MacBook Air are the Apple devices which use the second generation sensor. The new Touch ID unlocks almost instantly and posed an issue as it unlocks too fast to read notifications on the lock screen. This is remedied with the iOS 10 update in which a user must press the home button to have the home screen appear, however this can be changed in the iOS settings to where users can just rest their finger on the sensor to unlock the user's device and go directly to the home screen, similar to previous versions of iOS. Solely placing a finger on the sensor will only unlock the iPhone unless said setting is enabled, and no notifications are currently being displayed on the lock screen. \\n\\nHaving read that, could you tell me does the iphone 8 plus have touch id?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The paragraph states that the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, and 8 Plus have Touch ID.

Senior employees at the Survey found his behavioral oddities unsettling. Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO's budget and contemplate closing the station. He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.From 1989 to 1991, Glicken continued his volcanological studies in Japan as a postdoctoral fellow at the Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Later, while a research professor and translator at Tokyo Metropolitan University, Glicken became involved with research at Mount Unzen. The volcano had recently resumed eruptive activity in November 1990, after being dormant for 198 years. In the months after its first activity, it erupted sporadically, and the government evacuated its vicinity near the end of May 1991. On June 2, 1991, Glicken visited the mountain with Katia and Maurice Krafft. The three entered a danger zone near the base of the volcano the following day, assuming that any potentially hazardous pyroclastic flows would follow a turn in the landscape and safely bypass them. Later that day, a lava dome collapsed, sending a large flow down the valley at 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). The current reached the turn before separating into two parts, and the upper, hotter part swiftly overcame the volcanologists' post, killing them upon impact. In total, 41 or 42 people died in the incident, including press members who had been watching the volcanologists. The volcano burned down 390 houses, and the remains of the flow extended 2.5 miles (4 km) in length. Glicken's remains were found four days later, and were cremated according to his parents' wishes.

Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\\n\\nQuery: SELECT count(*) WHERE {\\n?x0 ns:film.film.sequel M0 .\\nM1 ns:film.cinematographer.film ?x0\\n} Question: Was a cinematographer of a prequel of M0 M1","target":"1","rationale":"The given query will not find the answer to the given question.

Natural resources may be renewable or non-renewable. Non-renewable resources cannot be replaced. When they're gone, they're gone. Renewable resources can be replaced. They can supply human activities forever. Fossil fuels are crucial for modern human society. Fossil fuels are essential for transportation, industry and agriculture. Renewable energy resources tend to be clean. They emit fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. Renewable resources often have other problems. They are more costly and less efficient than fossil fuels. Still, they have many advantages. Research is going into developing renewable resources.

The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...","target":"Mary","rationale":"The text explains that Mary is a Marian apparition and the monumental size of her stature reflects an older tradition. The question asks for the first name of this subject whose height represents a long-standing custom.

At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]\\n\\nThe continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]\\n\\nParagraph: Greg's grandma is a culinary expert.

The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes. The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.\\n\\n\\nQ: The single circular dna chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in what, but instead occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell?\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- atom\\n\\n- molecules\\n\\n- protons\\n\\n- nucleus\\n\\nA:","target":"nucleus","rationale":"The paragraph is describing the process of binary fission in prokaryotes.

The role of altered sialylation in multiple myeloma (MM) cell trafficking has not been previously investigated. In the present study we identified high expression of β-galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase, ST3GAL6, in MM cell lines and patients. This gene plays a key role in selectin ligand synthesis in humans through the generation of functional sialyl Lewis X. In MRC IX patients, high expression of this gene is associated with inferior overall survival. In this study we demonstrate that knockdown of ST3GAL6 results in a significant reduction in levels of α-2,3-linked sialic acid on the surface of MM cells with an associated significant reduction in adhesion to MM bone marrow stromal cells and fibronectin along with reduced transendothelial migration in vitro. In support of our in vitro findings, we demonstrate significantly reduced homing and engraftment of ST3GAL6 knockdown MM cells to the bone marrow niche in vivo, along with decreased tumor burden and prolonged survival.

The OMCC is one of the best-known star formation regions and the closest sector of the Milky Way to our Solar System where high-mass stars are born. The nebula is named after its main star, λ Orionis, a blue giant responsible for the ionization of the surrounding material.

One of the more famous examples is Playboy's inaugural December 1953 issue that featured photos of Marilyn Monroe from a 1949 photo session as its first Playmate of the Month. The commercialization, promotion, and organized supply of nude celebrity images can be traced to another men's magazine, High Society, and the efforts of its first female Editor, Gloria Leonard. This began as a feature that showcased risqué photos of celebrities like Jodie Foster and Goldie Hawn, usually lifted from film stills, and became a spin-off venture of High Society called Celebrity Skin magazine in 1986. Over its twenty-five year run Margot Kidder, Ann-Margret and Barbra Streisand unsuccessfully attempted to sue the magazine after it published nude photos of them. Yet another magazine earned additional notoriety for its publication of nude photographs of models who at the time were not celebrities, but later attained fame. Penthouse magazine published nude photos in its September 1984 issue of a young adult film actress, Traci Lords (later found to be underage at the time), and Vanessa Williams, then-Miss America, that caused her to be stripped of her crown.\\n Passage 3:Running rigging is the cordage used to control the shape and position of the sails. Materials have evolved from the use of Manilla rope to synthetic fibers, which include dacron, nylon and kevlar. Running rigging varies between fore-and-aft rigged vessels and square-rigged vessels. They have common functions between them for supporting, shaping and orienting sails, which employ different mechanisms. For supporting sails, halyards (sometimes haulyards), are used to raise sails and control luff tension. On gaff-rigged vessels, topping lifts hold the yards across the top of the sail aloft. Sail shape is usually controlled by lines that pull at the corners of the sail, including the outhaul at the clew and the downhaul at the tack on fore-and-aft rigs. The orientation of sails to the wind is controlled primarily by sheets, but also by braces, which position the yard arms with respect to the wind on square-rigged vessels.","target":"2","rationale":"The question asks which magazines have continued to publish nude images of celebrities.

During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.\\n\\n- A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.\\nA metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.\\n\\n- The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.\\n\\n- Three and One - half Fathom Ledge in Massachusetts , is a small barren rock in Massachusetts Bay , located within the city limits of Boston , USA . The rock is northeast of Martin Ledge and far east of the Roaring Bulls .\\n\\n- Biotechnology is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or \\"any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use\\" (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Art. 2). Depending on the tools and applications, it often overlaps with the (related) fields of bioengineering, biomedical engineering, biomanufacturing, molecular engineering, etc.\\n\\n- Greater Boston is the metropolitan region of New England encompassing the municipality of Boston, the capital of the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England, as well as its surrounding areas. The region forms the northern arc of the U.S. northeast megalopolis and as such, Greater Boston can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The MSA consists of most of the eastern third of Massachusetts, excluding the South Coast region and Cape Cod; while the CSA additionally includes the municipalities of Manchester (the largest city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire), Providence (the capital of the U.S. state of Rhode Island), Worcester, Massachusetts (the second largest city in New England), as well as the South Coast region and Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Greater Boston's most impactful contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education institutions and sports culture. Greater Boston also constitutes a region influential upon American history and industry. The region and the state of Massachusetts are global leaders in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.\\n\\n- The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States. The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics. The Census Bureau-defined region has a total area of with of that being land mass. Though lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally diverse region. Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent.\\n\\n- Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York.\\n\\n- Massachusetts Bay is a bay on the Atlantic Ocean that forms part of the coastline of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\\n\\n- Boston (pronounced ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. Boston is also the seat of Suffolk County, although the county government was disbanded on July 1, 1999. The city proper covers with an estimated population of 667,137 in 2015, making it the largest city in New England and the 23rd most populous city in the United States. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.7 million people in 2014 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. Alternately, as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest as such in the United States.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States. It borders the other U.S. states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of New York and the Green Mountains run north-south the length of the state.\\n\\n- The Massachusett are a Native American people who historically lived in areas surrounding Massachusetts Bay, as well as northeast and southern Massachusetts in what is now the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including present-day Greater Boston. Tribal members spoke the Massachusett language, which is part of the Algonquian language family. The present-day U.S state of Massachusetts is named after the tribe.\\n\\n- New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'three and one-half fathom ledge' and 'island'?","target":"instance of","rationale":"The answer is instance of.\\nThe fact that \\"three and one-half fathom ledge\\" being a part or type of rock means it's an instance of island, the same way 'shower' may be considered to be an instance of bathroom for example."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a date in \\"mm/dd/yyyy\\" format.

Methods: Case-study methodology was used to examine and contextualise the analysis of the Republic of Kiribati's adoption of the IPCP from 2003 to 2010. Data were collected from multiple sources including semi-structured interviews, IPCP documentation, program evaluation and a healthcare worker survey. Data were subjected to thematic analysis and descriptive statistics where relevant to the study design. Results: It was found that the self-initiated progression of activities and stimuli has resulted in the successful adoption of a comprehensive IPCP. The process followed the staged model of the classic Diffusion of Innovations process in organisations described by Everett Rogers. Conclusion: This case study provides an illustration of how a comprehensive IPCP can be adopted in a LMI country setting with little involvement from external agencies. It identifies key stimuli, opportunities and activities which could be similarly adopted and implemented by other LMI countries. \\n Title: Success in the South Pacific: a case study of successful diffusion of an infection prevention and control program","target":"False","rationale":"The title is not appropriate because it does not highlight the main findings of this particular case study, which is that an infection prevention and control program (IPCP) was successfully adopted in Kiribati with little external support.

Obsessed by the world of pool, Johnny could be one of the best. But his mentor Joe, a shady stakehorse, trains Johnny as a hustler, and decides how and who Johnny plays. Unbeknownst to Johnny, Joe has been holding him back from his dream: playing in the legitimate pro tour.  When Johnny finally learns that Joe intercepted and threw away an invitation for Johnny to join the pro tour, he breaks from Joe, throwing a game with a large pot.  Losing both that stake money and his hustler income source sparks Joe to violence, and he breaks Johnny's bridge hand outside the pool hall (an homage to a similar scene in the classic pool film The Hustler).  Joe is later beaten up by some of Johnny's friends as a warning to leave him alone.\\nAfter an ultimatum from his girlfriend Tara, Johnny largely leaves the world of pool hustling, and finally commits to a \\"real\\" job in the construction business, but is soon miserable there.

Both IGF-I and IGF-II are potent stimulators of amino acid uptake, cell proliferation, and differentiation; they also suppress protein degradation in these cells. In all measurements, the relative potencies are IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin. Two recombinant DNA-produced analogs of IGF-I, (Thr59)IGF-I and (N-Met)IGF-I, were as active as native IGF-I in all four assays. However, when 125I-labeled hormones were used for studies of binding to IGF receptors, there was a striking difference between the native and recombinant IGF-I molecules. Both were bound significantly by the type I receptor (a 350K molecule that is dissociated upon sulfhydryl reduction), but the recombinant analogs exhibited little cross-reactivity with the type II receptor (a 220K molecule that is not dissociated by reduction).

Residents of various specialties attended a mandatory short course on clinical teaching skills in the middle of their first year of postgraduate medical training. Three types of evaluation data were collected at three times during a two-year period: self-ratings by the residents, questionnaires completed by the residents, and ratings completed by students taught by the residents. Complete data for 18 residents indicated that the residents rated their teaching skills significantly higher after the course (at the end of both the first year and the second year) than before it. At the end of the second year, 94 percent of the residents stated that the course was helpful, 67 percent could recall and explain specific principles of teaching, and 61 percent reported using principles from the course in their teaching. Students' ratings of these 18 residents were too scanty to be interpreted validly. The study suggests that residents of varying specialties can profit from an introductory course on teaching skills and that the effects endure for at least one and a half years. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical values that show the rate of improvement in residents' teaching skills over time, and it also quantifies the percentage of residents who could recall and explain teaching principles after taking the course.

The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines.

The hCG injection given to the patients 36 hours before laparoscopy caused partial desensitization of adenylate cyclase of these cells to gonadotropins. Preincubation of the cells in hormone free medium for 2 to 3 days significantly increased their cAMP responsiveness to hCG. P production was stimulated initially by hCG and showed no desensitization. In the cells preincubated for 72 hours without hCG, a subsequent stimulus of 50 ng/ml of hCG elicited maximal cAMP response, whereas 1 ng/ml of hCG was sufficient to bring about maximal P secretion. Time-course studies indicated that maximal cAMP response to hCG was obtained in 1 to 3 hours. Both basal and hCG-stimulated P accumulation continued to rise for up to 24 hours. Preincubation of granulosa-luteal cells from hyperstimulated follicles improves the cells' cAMP responsiveness to hCG, whereas P response remains unaltered.","target":"Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate","rationale":"This abstract describes a study of the production of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and progesterone (P) in human granulosa-luteal cells following exposure to purified human chorionic gonadotropin.

It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation.

After the death of the king the Leprechauns returned to their places of origin, all except one (Warwick Davis) who remained in the mortal world and through the ages slowly became corrupted and obsessed with the treasure he still guarded. In the present Father Jacob (Willie C. Carpenter) is chased through the construction site of the youth center he had planned on building by the Leprechaun, whose gold Jacob had taken to fund the building project. Using four-leaf clover laced holy water Jacob manages to banish the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after drops dead of injuries inflicted by the Leprechaun during the fight.One year later two down on their luck friends Emily Woodrow (Tangi Miller) and Lisa Duncan (Sherrie Jackson) have their fortune told when the clairvoyant Esmeralda (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil. While having a barbecue at the abandoned youth center construction site with Lisa, their stoner friend Jamie Davis (Page Kennedy) and her ex-boyfriend turned drug dealer Rory Jackson (Laz Alonso) Emily falls through a hole and discovers the Leprechaun's gold in an old tunnel where it was hidden by Father Jacob. Splitting up the gold (which is produced in a never ending amount by the chest it was contained in) evenly the quartet of friends use it to fulfill their fantasies, unaware that by taking the gold they have released the Leprechaun, who begins stalking the group (killing a guest who takes one of his coins at a party held by Jamie, prompting the police to temporarily arrest him). At the salon where Emily works the Leprechaun sneaks in and, after killing a regular customer, Doria, on the massage table by breaking her neck, attacks Emily, who barely escapes and warns Rory and the recently released Jamie, who rush to get to Lisa's. In her house Lisa is attacked by the Leprechaun and manages to fight him off for a short while, but is killed when the Leprechaun claws her in the stomach, with her friends finding her body moments later.While Emily and Jamie want to return the gold Rory does not and takes off with it; shortly after realizing Rory is gone Emily is attacked and chased outside by the Leprechaun, but is saved when Rory has a change of heart and comes back for her. Searching for Rory the Leprechaun stops by his house and kills Rory's profligate girlfriend Chanel (Keesha Sharp) by tearing out her upper jaw, reclaiming the gold she used to make a tooth while Rory and Emily are stopped and harassed by Officers Thompson (Beau Billingslea) and Whitaker (Chris Murray). After the Leprechaun appears and kills the two officers Emily and Rory escape and regroup with Jamie, only to be confronted by a machine gun wielding group of Rory's drug dealing rivals, led by Watson (Shiek Mahmud-Bey) and Cedric (Sticky Fingaz). Planning on executing Rory for infringing on their territory Watson and his gang are all disposed of by the Leprechaun, (who kills Watson and Cedric while the other two members run off) while Emily, Rory and Jamie drive off in Watson's car (which the Leprechaun latches to the bottom of for a short while) and go looking for help from Esmeralda.Advised to use four-leaf clovers against the Leprechaun by Esmeralda, Rory laces the hollow-point bullets of his gun with clovers Jamie finds in the marijuana Rory had earlier sold him. When the Leprechaun arrives Rory shoots him several times with the clover bullets, only for his gun to jam before he can finish the Leprechaun off.

A multivariate analysis of 1,116 adenocarcinomas containing these 71 kinase-fusion–positive adenocarcinomas identified four independent factors that are indicators of poor prognosis: age ≥50 years, male sex, high pathological stage and negative kinase-fusion status..

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a $100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a $250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding...\\nQuestion: What kind of message is being sent to those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? \\nIs it More than a $250 fine?","target":"No","rationale":"The article states that a woman would receive the same fine for being beaten as someone who beats their dog, and implies this is not enough of a punishment.

Treatment of rats with calcium channel blockers before ethanol or indomethacin administration resulted in a significant decline in the mean number of lesions per glandular stomach, the damaged area of the glandular stomach, and the severity of lesions. Calcium channel blockers also caused a significant decline in the incidence of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions, but had no effect on the incidence of ethanol-induced gastric lesions. These results offer the first evidence that calcium channel blockers may play an important role in the protection against chemically induced gastric lesions and thereby offer insight into the mechanism of gastric ulcer formation.

Passage:In 1996, Smith began his coaching career as an assistant at Hempfield High School. From there Smith spent the next four seasons as the passing coordinator for the Duquesne Dukes. In 2001, Smith returned to his high school alma mater the Gateway Gators where he served as the offensive coordinator. The following season Smith was named as the Gators Head Coach and over the next eleven seasons Smith led Gateway to a 101-30 mark and four WPIAL runner-up finishes.. In that time Smith sent 23 players to NCAA FBS (I-A) colleges and 17 more to FCS(I-AA) colleges, and coached in three U.S. Army All-America and Semper Fidelis All-America games. He has mentored six NFL players, including former Nittany Lions Trevor Williams, Jordan Lucas, Justin King and Lydell Sargeant. Smith, who also served as the athletic director, departed Gateway following the 2012 football season when his athletic director position was reduced to part-time. His salary was also cut in half and the district instituted a new rule that no administrator could coach. Following a January recruiting visit in 2013, the Temple Owls coach and fellow Penn State alum Matt Rhule offered Smith a coaching position as his wide receivers coach. Smith accepted and helped the Owls’ passing game reach new heights during the 2013 season. In 2014 James Franklin hired Smith as the Penn State Nittany Lions’ defensive recruiting coordinator and cornerbacks coach, positions he currently maintains.

Fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies. These 50 victims were classified into two groups, the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet, indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers. The remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect. It is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived, whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived. The result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body, the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent. The conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally, imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them. The rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point, and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak. In contrast, the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds, and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape. It has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival.","target":"Lightning injury caused by discharges accompanying flashovers--a clinical and experimental study of death and survival","rationale":"This paper investigated lightning injuries caused by 44 thunderbolts.

It was over ten years ago now… I was diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder but presenting with symptoms of Bi Polar Mania.

I do not have the education to elaborate on say, Pharmaceuticals or Cognitive Science (other than a few college courses on Behavioral Psychology) nor can I comprehend these fields of reference as clearly as I’d like to, but what I experienced was… GETTING THE WRONG MEDICATION!! for my presenting psychological manifestations.\\nI was put on Seroquil; too sedating even in minute doses. Prozac. Sent me over the edge, and a complete 180 to the point where I was extremely delusional and dangerously suicidal. These mind-altering medications can be fatal. It was scary and literally ruined my life for a time…\\nI was worse than minorly-depressed or hypo-manic (conditions much more manageable than what I previously described) for a long time when I first started a regime with Zoloft, but it did wind up being the best drug to manage my depressive state and enable me to function in a more socially adaptive manner.

It was the first of what the Chinese later called the \\"unequal treaties\\" on the ground that Britain had no obligations in return.\\n\\n- The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the head and representative of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and head of the Government of Hong Kong. The position was created to replace the Governor of Hong Kong, the representative of the Monarch of the United Kingdom during British rule. The office, stipulated by the Hong Kong Basic Law, formally came into being on 1 July 1997 when the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China.\\n\\n- Central (also Central District) is the central business district of Hong Kong. It is located in Central and Western District, on the north shore of Hong Kong Island, across Victoria Harbour from Tsim Sha Tsui, the southernmost point of Kowloon Peninsula. The area was the heart of Victoria City, although that name is rarely used today.\\n\\n- The term basic law is used in some places as an alternative to \\"constitution\\", implying it is a \\"temporary but necessary measure\\" without formal enactment of constitution. A basic law is either a codified constitution, or in countries with uncodified constitutions, a law given to have constitution powers and effect. The name is usually used to imply an interim or transitory nature, or avoid attempting a claim to being \\"the highest law\\", often for religious reasons. In West Germany the term \\"Basic Law\\" (\\"Grundgesetz\\") was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate reunification of Germany. But in 1990 no new constitution was adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory. Basic law is entrenched in that it overrides ordinary 'statute law' passed by the legislature.\\n\\n- The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- The First Opium War (, 183942), also known as the Opium War and the Anglo-Chinese War, was fought between the United Kingdom and the Qing dynasty over their conflicting viewpoints on diplomatic relations, trade, and the administration of justice for foreign nationals in China.\\n\\n- Hong Kong Island is an island in the southern part of Hong Kong. It has a population of 1,289,500 and its population density is 16,390/km², . The island had a population of about 3,000 inhabitants scattered in a dozen fishing villages when it was occupied by the United Kingdom in the First Opium War. In 1842, the island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the UK under the Treaty of Nanking and the City of Victoria was then established on the island by the British Force in honour of Queen Victoria.\\n\\n- The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.\\n\\n- Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.\\n\\n- Government House ( Chinese :  ; formerly  /  /  ) , located on Government Hill in the Central District of Hong Kong Island , is the official residence of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong . The building was constructed in 1855 as a Colonial Renaissance style , but was significantly remodelled during Japanese occupation , resulting in the current hybrid Japanese - neoclassical form . Government House was the official residence of the Governor from 1855 to 1997 , when the city was under British rule . 25 governors of Hong Kong , out of total 28 , used this building as official residence .\\n\\n- Upper Albert Road is a road on the Government Hill in the Central area of Hong Kong.

From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India.\\n\\n- Government House is the name of many of the residences of Governors-General, Governors and Lieutenant-Governors in the Commonwealth and the remaining colonies of the British Empire. It serves as the venue for the Governor's official business, as well as the many receptions and functions hosted by the occupant. Sometimes, \\"Government House\\" is used as a metonym for the Governor or his office.\\n\\n- An official residence is the residence at which a nation's head of state, head of government, governor or other senior figure officially resides. It may or may not be the same location where the individual conducts work-related functions, or actually lives.\\n\\n- A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.\\n\\n- The Government Hill is a hill in Central, Hong Kong, bounded by upper section of Upper Albert Road on the south, Queen's Road Central north, Garden Road east, and Glenealy, west of Hong Kong Island.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'government house' and 'government of hong kong'?","target":"owned by","rationale":"The answer is Government House was the official residence of the Governor from 1855 to 1997, when the city was under British rule (line 7), and line 8: Upper Albert Road is a road on the Government Hill in Central.\\n\\nThen line 5 says Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in executive branch who often presides over cabinet...

The legality of secession was hotly debated in the 19th century, with Southerners often claiming and Northerners generally denying that states have a legal right to unilaterally secede. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the Constitution to be an \`\`indestructible'' union. There is no legal basis a state can point to for unilaterally seceding. Many scholars hold that the Confederate secession was blatantly illegal. The Articles of Confederation explicitly state the Union is \`\`perpetual''; the U.S. Constitution declares itself an even \`\`more perfect union'' than the Articles of Confederation. Other scholars, while not necessarily disagreeing that the secession was illegal, point out that sovereignty is often de facto an \`\`extralegal'' question. Had the Confederacy won, any illegality of its actions under U.S. law would have been rendered irrelevant, just as the undisputed illegality of American rebellion under the British law of 1775 was rendered irrelevant. Thus, these scholars argue, the illegality of unilateral secession was not firmly de facto established until the Union won the Civil War; in this view, the legal question was resolved at Appomattox.\\nQuestion: can a state secede from the united states of america?","target":"No","rationale":"The constitution does not directly mention secession.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.\\n\\nBubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil.

The Captaincy had its capital in Cebu from 1565 to 1595, and in Manila from 1595 until 1898. As part of the extensive governmental reforms during the early Bourbon period throughout the overseas possessions, an Intendencia was established in Manila by Royal Decree of July 17, 1784 that handled issues regarding the government finances and to promote the economy. Ciriaco González Carbajal was appointed as Oidor of the Audiencia of Manila and was instructed to abide by the Royal Ordinance of Mayors of 1782, that had been enacted in Rio de la Plata. Carbajal proposed the establishment of more Intendencias in Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo and Cebu, and although they were created on November 24, 1786, they were later abolished by the Royal Decree of November 20, 1787.

An elevated ACE level is suggestive of sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. This is supported by the presence of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy. Treatment generally depends on the severity and extent of organ involvement, but first-line treatment for pulmonary disease consists of oral prednisone or corticosteroids to control the acute inflammatory response. Therefore, option (1) would be an appropriate choice if pulmonary involvement was severe enough to require immediate intervention with steroids; however, given that no symptoms are present besides skin lesions and hilar adenopathies, it would be reasonable to continue monitoring at this time without starting corticosteroids or any other medication.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. He was also named to the all-time All-Pro team selected in 1968 and to the National Football League (NFL) 1950s All-Decade Team. A native of Wausau, Wisconsin, Hirsch played college football as a halfback at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan, helping to lead both the 1942 Badgers and the 1943 Wolverines to No. 3 rankings in the final AP Polls.\\nContext: In January 1945, the Cleveland Rams selected Hirsch in the first round (fifth overall pick) of the 1945 NFL Draft. In May, he announced that he would not sign a contract with the Rams, stating that he intended to return to the University of Wisconsin after his discharge from the military.  He ultimately opted not to play in the NFL, instead playing for the Chicago Rockets of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Hirsch chose the Rockets because they were coached by Dick Hanley, who had been Hirsch's coach with the El Toro Marines team. Hirsch played three seasons with the Rockets from 1946 to 1948. During those three years, the Rockets compiled a 7-32 record and won only one game in each of the 1947 and 1948 seasons. Hirsch later said the decision to sign with the Rockets was the worst decision he ever made.  In a remarkable display of versatility, Hirsch appeared in all 14 games for the Rockets in 1946, contributing 1,445 yards: 384 kickoff return yards and one touchdown; 347 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns; 235 punt return yards and one touchdown; 226 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown; 156 passing yards and one passing touchdown; and 97 return yards on six interceptions.  In September 1947, Hirsch caught a 76-yard touchdown pass for an AAFC record. However, injuries limited Hirsch to five games in 1947. He was described in December 1947 as probably \\"the highest paid waterboy in pro football.\\"  In the fifth game of the 1948 season, Hirsch sustained a fracture on the right side of his skull after being kicked in the head during a game against the Cleveland Browns. Hirsch did not return to action during the 1948 season, totaling 101 receiving yards and 93 rushing yards in five games.\\nQuestion: Did Elroy win any championships with the Chicago Rockets?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"During those three years, the Rockets compiled a 7-32 record and won only one game in each of the 1947 and 1948 seasons.","rationale":"The context tells us that Hirsch played three seasons with the Rockets from 1946 to 1948.

After graduating from Michigan State University (from which, five decades later, he would receive an honorary doctorate), he became the pianist and arranger for the vocal group the Hi-Lo's in the late 1950s. Fischer went on to work with Donald Byrd and Dizzy Gillespie, and became known for his Latin and bossa nova recordings in the 1960s. He composed the Latin jazz standard \\"Morning\\", and the jazz standard \\"Pensativa\\".\\n\\nIn 1975, after ten years of studiowork and artistically successful yet obscure solo records, Fischer found a new direction. Just like Hancock and Chick Corea he was a pioneer on the electric keyboard, and in that capacity he joined vibraphonist Cal Tjader's group. The reunion with Tjader gave a new impulse to Fischer's love of Latin-American music. He started his own group with Latino musicians, \\"Salsa Picante\\", which showed great eclecticism in musical styles. Later he expanded to include four vocalists billed separately as \\"2 + 2\\".  The album 2+2 won a Grammy in 1981. After that he recorded And Sometimes Voices and Free Fall with the vocal group. Free Fall was nominated in three categories for the Grammy Awards and won under the category of \\"Best Jazz Album By A Vocal Duo Or Group\\". Crazy Bird was with the instrumental group and Alone Together, a solo piano album recorded on a Hamburg Steinway. It was recorded for Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer and the German company MPS Records.  In the seventies, Fischer began doing orchestral sweeteners for R&B groups. His nephew, Andre Fischer, was the drummer of the band Rufus, featuring Chaka Khan. \\"Apparently the arrangements I made for their early records were appreciated, for in the following years I was hired almost exclusively by black artists.\\" Among the artists Fischer worked for are The Jacksons, Earl Klugh, Switch, Debarge, Shotgun (a late 70s offshoot of 24-Carat Black) and Atlantic Starr. His walls are now covered with gold and platinum records from these recordings, Grammy Award Nominations, and several NARAS MVP Awards, culminating in an MVP-emeritus in 1985.  Once his fame as an arranger was established, Fischer also worked with pop musicians like Paul McCartney, Prince, Celine Dion and Robert Palmer. \\"I am surprised that my arrangements are now considered one of the prerequisites for a hit album. People feel that they make a song sound almost classical.\\"  Classical concert artist Richard Stoltzman commissioned him in 1983 to write a symphonic work using Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn themes.

Furthermore, sphingosine 1-phosphate did not affect the adenylate cyclase activity of the membrane preparations made from the canine right atrium and right ventricle, indicating the involvement of a novel signaling pathway in sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced cardiac effects.\\\\Question: Does sphingosine 1-phosphate induce sinus tachycardia and coronary vasoconstriction in the canine heart?","target":"These results may provide a clue to better understanding the physiological as well as the pathophysiological regulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate in the heart","rationale":"The given passage ends with the statement \\"These results may provide a clue to better understanding the physiological as well as the pathophysiological regulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate in the heart\\".

On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family.

Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\\nThat’s right, you STOP!\\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all.

There are no lush rugs or stylish furniture. The large table in the conference room is simple varnished wood. Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space. Brewer, who has been at the agency 20 years, said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor. \\"The private bar could meet more of the need through pro bono work, but there are still cases that involve the systemic problems for low-income people that we would need to do,\\" said Brewer. \\"The legal system marketplace just doesn't serve low-income people too well, except in fee-generat-ing type cases,\\" Brewer said. \\"If a poor person gets run over by a bus, an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage award as attorney fees. But so many of the cases we handle have to do with basic rights and a decent life. There is just no profit motive.\\" Larry Pivnick, law professor at the University of Memphis Law School and director of political programs at MALS, said Legal Services is a great learning laboratory for law students. \\"There are thousands and thousands of people who have problems that never get an opportunity to appear in court,\\" Pivnick said. \\"Some people may not be particularly articulate.

Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work. According to The Times: \\"Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from Bowie\\". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \\"parting gift\\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \\"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day. On 15 January, Blackstar debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart.

Their atoms join together to form molecules, crystals, or other structures. The atoms are held together by chemical bonds. A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. It occurs when atoms share or transfer valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom. You can learn more about chemical bonds in this video: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Look at the example of water in Figure 7.1. A water molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. The oxygen atom has six valence electrons. In a water molecule, two hydrogen atoms share their two electrons with the six valence electrons of one oxygen atom. By sharing electrons, each atom has electrons available to fill its sole or outer energy level. This gives it a more stable arrangement of electrons that takes less energy to maintain. Water (H2 O) is an example of a chemical compound. Water molecules always consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Like water, all other chemical compounds consist of a fixed ratio of elements. It doesnt matter how much or how little of a compound there is. It always has the same composition. Elements are represented by chemical symbols. Examples are H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Compounds are represented by chemical formulas. Youve already seen the chemical formula for water. Its H2 O. The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in a molecule of water. The O for oxygen has no subscript. When there is just one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used. Table 7.1 shows some other examples of compounds and their chemical formulas. Name of Compound Electron Dot Diagram Numbers of Atoms Chemical Formula Name of Compound Hydrogen chloride Electron Dot Diagram Numbers of Atoms H=1 Cl = 1 Chemical Formula HCl Methane C=1 H=4 CH4 Hydrogen peroxide H=2 O=2 H2 O2 Carbon dioxide C=1 O=2 CO2 Problem Solving Problem: A molecule of ammonia consists of one atom of nitrogen (N) and three atoms of hydrogen (H). What is its chemical formula? Solution: The chemical formula is NH3 . You Try It! Problem: A molecule of nitrogen dioxide consists of one atom of nitrogen (N) and two atoms of oxygen (O). What is its chemical formula? The same elements may combine in different ratios. If they do, they form different compounds. Figure 7.2 shows some examples. Both water (H2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) consist of hydrogen and oxygen. However, they have different ratios of the two elements. As a result, water and hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties. If youve ever used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a cut, then you know that it is very different from water! Both carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO) consist of carbon and oxygen, but in different ratios. How do their properties differ? There are different types of compounds. They differ in the nature of the bonds that hold their atoms together. The type of bonds in a compound determines many of its properties. Three types of bonds are ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds.

Booth was a member of the prominent 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland and, by the 1860s, was a well-known actor. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and strongly opposed to the abolition of slavery in the United States.\\n\\n- Tom Taylor ( 19 October 1817 -- 12 July 1880 ) was an English dramatist , critic , biographer , public servant , and editor of Punch magazine .

He was the third actor of this name in a family of actors and managers, and one of the most famous of all 19th century American comedians. Jefferson was particularly well known for his adaptation and portrayal of Rip Van Winkle on the stage, reprising the role in several silent film adaptations. Through his appearances in the latter, he is believed to be the earliest born actor to appear in a film.\\n\\n- Our American Cousin is a three-act play by English playwright Tom Taylor. The play is a farce whose plot is based on the introduction of an awkward, boorish, but honest American, Asa Trenchard, to his aristocratic English relatives when he goes to England to claim the family estate. The play first premiered at Laura Keene's Theatre in New York City on October 15, 1858, and the title character was first played by Joseph Jefferson. Although the play achieved great renown during its first few years and remained very popular throughout the second half of the 19th century, it is best remembered as the play U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was attending in Ford's Theatre when he was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865.\\n\\n- Ford's Theatre is a theatre in Washington, D.C., used for various stage performances beginning in the 1860s.

A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration. Many scholars now use the term chattel slavery to refer to this specific sense of legalised, \\"de jure\\" slavery. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is \\"de facto\\" forced to work against his or her will. Scholars also use the more generic terms such as unfree labour or forced labour, to refer to such situations. However  and especially under slavery in broader senses of the word  slaves may have some rights and/or protections, according to laws and/or customs. \\n\\n- Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809  April 15, 1865) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated.

His father, Ghulam Qader, who migrated to Kunduz, is originally from the center of Ghazni province. Afghan businessman and Kharoti tribal leader Gholam Serwar Nasher deemed Hekmatyar to be a bright young man and sent him to the Mahtab Qala military academy in 1968, but he was expelled due to his political views two years later. From 1970 to 1972, Hekmatyar attended Kabul University's engineering department.\\n\\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in the United States Hekmatyar, who had allegedly \\"worked closely\\" with bin Laden in early 1990s, declared his opposition to the US campaign in Afghanistan and criticized Pakistan for assisting the United States. After the U.S. entry into the anti-Taliban alliance and the fall of the Taliban, Hekmatyar rejected the U.N.-brokered accord of 5 December 2001 negotiated in Germany as a post-Taliban interim government for Afghanistan. As a result of pressure by the U.S. and the Karzai administration, on 10 February 2002 all the offices of Hezb-e-Islami were closed in Iran and Hekmatyar was expelled by his Iranian hosts.  The United States accuses Hekmatyar of urging Taliban fighters to re-form and fight against Coalition troops in Afghanistan. He is also accused of offering bounties for those who kill U.S. troops. He has been labeled a war criminal by members of the U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai's government. He is also a suspect behind the 5 September 2002 assassination attempt on Karzai that killed more than a dozen people. In September 2002, Hekmatyar released a taped message calling for jihad against the United States. On 25 December 2002 the news broke that American spy organizations had discovered Hekmatyar attempting to join al-Qaeda. According to the news, he had said that he was available to aid them. However, in a video released by Hekmatyar 1 September 2003, he denied forming alliances with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but praised attacks against U.S. and international forces.  On 19 February 2003 the United States State Department and the United States Treasury Department jointly designated Hekmatyar a \\"global terrorist.\\" This designation meant that any assets Hekmatyar held in the USA, or held through companies based in the U.S., would be frozen. The U.S. also requested the United Nations Committee on Terrorism to follow suit, and designate Hekmatyar an associate of Osama bin Laden. In October 2003, he declared a ceasefire with local commanders in Jalalabad, Kunar, Logar and Surobi, and stated that they should only fight foreigners.  In May 2006, he released a video to Al Jazeera in which he accused Iran of backing the U.S. in the Afghan conflict and said he was ready to fight alongside Osama bin Laden and blamed the ongoing conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan on U.S. interference. In September 2006, he was reported as captured, but the report was later retracted.

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.\\n\\n- Spreo is an alternative genus of starling in the family Sturnidae. They are now usually lumped in the genus \\"Lamprotornis\\". \\nIt contains the following species:\\n\\n- Melanin ( \\"melas\\", \\"black, dark\\") is a broad term for a group of natural pigments found in most organisms. Melanin is produced by the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine, followed by polymerization. The pigment is produced in a specialized group of cells known as melanocytes.\\n\\n- An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.\\n\\n- A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).\\nThe passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.\\n\\n- Plumage (\\"feather\\") refers both to the layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies, and may vary with age classes. Within species there can be different colour morphs.\\n\\n- New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\\n\\n- A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.\\n\\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\\n\\n- The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.\\n\\n- Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.\\n\\n- The myna (also known as mynah) is a bird of the starling family (Sturnidae). This is a group of passerine birds which are native to southern Asia, especially India. Several species have been introduced to areas like North America, Australia, South Africa, Fiji and New Zealand, especially the common myna which is often regarded as an invasive species. Often known as \\"Selarang\\" in Singapore, due to their high population located at the area.\\n\\n- The Sahara (\\", 'the Greatest Desert') is the largest hot desert and the third largest desert in the world after Antarctica and the Arctic. Its area of is comparable to the area of the United States.\\n\\n- Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.\\n\\n- Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.\\n\\n- The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area).\\n\\n- Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African.\\n\\n- Amino acids are biologically important organic compounds containing amine (-NH) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side-chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, though other elements are found in the side-chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (-), beta- (-), gamma- (-) or delta- (-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side-chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acids comprise the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles, cells and other tissues. Outside proteins, amino acids perform critical roles in processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.\\n\\n- Lamprotornis is a large genus of glossy - starlings all of which occur in Africa south of the Sahara . They have glossy blue or green upper parts , which is due to hollow melanin granules arranged in a single layer near the feather barbule 's surface . This unique arrangement led to some glossy starlings formerly placed in the genus Spreo being transferred to Lamprotornis , since they shared this feature ( but see also below ) . The under parts of these species lack iridescence . They may be blue , purple , yellow or brown . Most Lamprotornis starlings have striking yellow or red irides and some have long tails . These glossy starlings are found in a variety of habitats from forests to open woodland and gardens . They nest in tree holes , either natural , or made by woodpeckers or barbets , and some will use man - made structures . Most species are resident apart from seasonal or local movement , but Shelley 's starling is migratory . Most species are gregarious outside the breeding season . Lamprotornis glossy - starlings are omnivorous and mostly feed on the ground , although they will take fruit from trees . Some will feed on or near large mammals to find insects .\\n\\n- Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. The name \\"Sturnidae\\" comes from the Latin word for starling, \\"sturnus\\". Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as North America, Hawaii and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific, the common myna is indeed common.\\n\\n- Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas.\\n\\n- The common starling (\\"Sturnus vulgaris\\"), also known as the European starling, or in the British Isles just the starling, is a medium-sized passerine bird in the starling family, Sturnidae. It is about long and has glossy black plumage with a metallic sheen, which is speckled with white at some times of year. The legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer; young birds have browner plumage than the adults. It is a noisy bird, especially in communal roosts and other gregarious situations, with an unmusical but varied song. Its gift for mimicry has been noted in literature including the \\"Mabinogion\\" and the works of Pliny the Elder and William Shakespeare.\\n\\n- The common myna (\\"Acridotheres tristis\\"), sometimes spelled mynah, also sometimes known as \\"Indian myna\\", is a member of the family Sturnidae (starlings and mynas) native to Asia. An omnivorous open woodland bird with a strong territorial instinct, the myna has adapted extremely well to urban environments.\\n\\n- Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\\n\\n- India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states:\\n“Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.”\\nYet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...\\nQuestion: The strike will likely last\\nOptions:\\n- 1 year\\n- not enough information\\n- 2 weeks\\n- 6 months","target":"2 weeks","rationale":"The context mentions the UCU's industrial action concerning pension security, which has been occurring for two weeks.

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum.

Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites.

The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased.
