Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.\\n\\n- Homogenic is the third international solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997.

The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the \\"Billboard\\" 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.\\n\\n- The Christianization of Scandinavia took place between the 8th and the 12th centuries. The realms of Scandinavia proper, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, established their own Archdioceses, responsible directly to the Pope, in 1104, 1154 and 1164, respectively. The conversion to Christianity of the Scandinavian people required more time, since it took additional efforts to establish a network of churches. The Sami remained unconverted until the 18th century.\\n\\n- In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors.

Over her four-decade career, she has developed an eclectic musical style that draws on a wide range of influences and genres spanning electronic, pop, experimental, classical, trip hop, IDM, and avant-garde styles. She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single \\"Birthday\\" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. Björk embarked on a solo career in 1993, coming to prominence as a solo artist with albums such as \\"Debut\\" (1993), \\"Post\\" (1995), and \\"Homogenic\\" (1997), while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects. \\n\\n- Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s.

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\\n\\n- Wu-Tang Clan is an American hip hop group from New York City, originally composed of East Coast rappers RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God and Masta Killa.

I was so excited because we had the whole place to our family! We spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places. There was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets. My brother, Kelsey, and I played hide and go seek for hours, watched movies and swam until the sun went down. It was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories. We'll never forget our trip to Elk River Castle! \\nQuestion: Even though the narrator's parents wanted to plan a different-than-normal family vacation, name at least one thing that was the same as past vacations.\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

However, a movie theater isn't mentioned in this passage until after their arrival; it's not clear whether they went or didn't go. Additionally, while movie theaters are common at vacation destinations, there's no mention of going to one on previous trips either - so it could be different from what they've done before also!\\nSo that answer can only be \\"No\\"."},{"source":"I have a new situation: Owen inherited two pieces of land. The Eastern land was in fact some wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: Which land had no flooded soil?","target":"Western","rationale":"In the background information, a key term is hypoxia. This refers to when there is an insufficient amount of oxygen for proper functioning or survival of living organisms. The passage indicates that hypoxic soil develops when soil is flooded and that this condition can be found in wetlands such as on Owen's Eastern land. Given these facts, we know that soils on the eastern part of his property are likely \\"flooded\\" with water and therefore do not have sufficient amounts of oxygen present within them.\\nBased on these details about wetland conditions, it makes sense to assume that Western lands would not have problems with flooding given by definition they should be dryer than their counterparts making up the Eastern portion of his estate (i.e., no floods).\\nSo without looking at other choices like A"},{"source":"Given a part of privacy policy text, classify it into one of these categories: \\n (1) First Party Collection/Use (how and why a service provider collects user information), \\n (2) Third Party Sharing/Collection (how user information may be shared with or collected by third parties), \\n (3) User Choice/Control (choices and control options available to users), \\n (4) User Access, Edit, & Deletion (if and how users may access, edit, or delete their information), \\n (5) Data Retention (how long user information is stored), \\n (6) Data Security (how user information is protected), \\n (7) Policy Change (if and how users will be informed about changes to the privacy policy).\\n\\nThe site collects your contact information for marketing purposes.

The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vanska after the release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997). In 2001, Vanska was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.\\n\\nEarlier Nightwish performs symphonic metal with soaring female operatic vocals. Their music has been described as \\"bombastic heavy, symphonic and cinematic, with keyboards and strings creating a gothic atmosphere\\". They have also been known to play power metal and gothic metal.  The band's music is also known to be complex and layered. Their approach is epic, theatrical and operatic. Critic Chad Bowar notes that the music is \\"always very melodic with memorable choruses and a lot of hooks.\\"  The usage of a female vocalist has become a sort of trademark, though less so since the outbreak of new female fronted metal bands in the mid-2000s with the popularization of bands such as Evanescence and Leaves' Eyes as well as several gothic metal bands mixing female and male vocals, such as Lacuna Coil, Tristania, Epica and the early Within Temptation.  Bassist and vocalist Marco Hietala describes the style of the band's music as \\"melodic symphonic metal;\\" though this is not a view shared by all members of the group, including band composer Tuomas Holopainen, who describes the band as simply symphonic metal. Some critics find that the band had a gothic sound since their debut. The music of Nightwish had been \\"distinguished by the operatic voice\\" of soprano Tarja Turunen, a \\"charismatic frontwoman with a powerful voice\\". Critics observed that her vocals became less operatic with the release of Once. Following the departure of Tarja Turunen from the group, Nightwish left behind the \\"signature operatic vocals\\" of their earlier albums.  While the music of Nightwish is centered around a female lead singer, the band has also featured some male vocals on their albums ever since their debut release Angels Fall First. This debut album also included \\"elements of folk music and ambience\\" that were discarded on their subsequent album Oceanborn. However, the song \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" from the album \\"Once\\" featured some use of folk-oriented Native American melodies, and their 2007 release Dark Passion Play featured folk music elements on the songs \\"The Islander\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\".\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What is their new style like?","target":"their 2007 release Dark Passion Play featured folk music elements on the songs \\"The Islander\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\".","rationale":"From the given context, it is clearly visible that their 2007 release Dark Passion Play featured folk music elements on the songs \\"The Islander\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\"."},{"source":"Given a passage with a question and an answer to that question, classify if the answer actually answers the question into 'yes' or 'no'.

When he does come to discover Hee-soo's lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him and prepares to inform Kang, but his attraction to her causes him to hesitate.

The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.\\n\\n- Tallahassee is the capital of the U.S. state of Florida.

Results were compared with similar data from 30 normal children, 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 11 patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect. In patients with partial AV canal, the portion of total cardiac length occupied by the atrial septum did not differ from normal (24.8 +/- 9.9% versus 28.7 +/- 7.9%, p greater than 0.05), but there was a deficiency of both AV and ventricular septal tissue, the latter occupying only 48.2 +/- 7.0% of total cardiac length (versus 57.9 +/- 4.1% in normal subjects, p less than 0.05). Similarly, patients with complete AV canal had a normal amount of atrial septal tissue, a deficiency of AV septal tissue and a deficiency of ventricular septal tissue which was even greater than that of patients with a partial defect (39.4 +/- 5.0% versus 48.2 +/- 7.0%, p less than 0.05). Thus, although partial AV canal defect is often called ostium primum atrial septal defect, the amount of atrial tissue is usually normal, the defect being formed by a deficiency of AV and ventricular septal tissue.

It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a \\"great white whale\\" as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick.

The mean proliferative activity (percentage of nuclei greater than diploid peak) was 2.1% for the group of epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia, 3.1% for those with moderate dysplasia, 4.0% for severe dysplasia, and 6.8% for carcinomas. Hypertetraploid cell nuclei (HT cells) were not found in epithelia with hyperplasia and mild dysplasia. Seven out of 15 patients with epithelia showing moderate dysplasia had HT cells; 5 of these patients developed a carcinoma. One of 8 without HT cells developed a severe dysplasia. Nine patients with severe dysplasia had HT cells; 4 had recurrences and 4 developed carcinoma within 4 years.

He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes.

In 1770 he sat on a Marblehead committee that sought to enforce importation bans on taxed British goods. He frequently communicated with other Massachusetts opponents of British policy, including Samuel Adams, John Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, and others.  In May 1772 he won election to the Great and General Court of the Province of Massachusetts Bay (its legislative assembly). There he worked closely with Samuel Adams to advance colonial opposition to Parliamentary colonial policies. He was responsible for establishing Marblehead's committee of correspondence, one of the first to be set up after that of Boston. However, an incident of mob action prompted him to resign from the committee the next year. Gerry and other prominent Marbleheaders had established a hospital for performing smallpox inoculations on Cat Island; because the means of transmission of the disease were not known at the time, fears amongst the local population led to protests which escalated into violence that wrecked the facilities and threatened the proprietors' other properties.  Gerry reentered politics after the Boston Port Act closed that city's port in 1774, and Marblehead became a port to which relief supplies from other colonies could be delivered. As one of the town's leading merchants and Patriots, Gerry played a major role in ensuring the storage and delivery of supplies from Marblehead to Boston, interrupting those activities only to care for his dying father.

Pope Julius II, intending to curb Venetian influence in northern Italy, had created the League of Cambrai, an anti-Venetian alliance consisting of himself, Louis XII of France, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Maximilian I, the Holy Roman Emperor. Although the League was initially successful, friction between Julius and Louis caused it to collapse by 1510; Julius then allied himself with Venice against France. The Veneto-Papal alliance eventually expanded into the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about the division of the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France. Under the leadership of Francis I, who had succeeded Louis to the throne, the French and Venetians would, through victory at Marignano in 1515, regain the territory they had lost; the treaties of Noyon and Brussels, which ended the war the next year, would essentially return the map of Italy to the status quo of 1508.\\n\\nQuestion: Which Italian State participated in the War of the Holy League?\\n\\nAnswer:","target":"Republic of Venice","rationale":"To answer the question \\"Which Italian State participated in the War of the Holy League?\\", we need to find out which states are included as participants.

He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh Wrangler in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.  Russell first met the American Quaker Alys Pearsall Smith when he was 17 years old. He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family - they knew him primarily as \\"Lord John's grandson\\" and enjoyed showing him off. He traveled with them to the continent; it was in their company that Russell visited the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and was able to climb the Eiffel Tower soon after it was completed.  He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, who was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage and they finally divorced in 1921, after a lengthy period of separation. During this period, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Lady Ottoline Morrell and the actress Lady Constance Malleson. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the English governess and writer, and first wife of T. S. Eliot.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Bertrand Russell","rationale":"From the given context, it is evident that the text refers to Bertrand Russell."},{"source":"In this task, you are given the name of an Indian food dish.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode.

Jen's had body image issues for a long time and always puts herself down. She's talked a lot before about wishing she was thin.

Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.

Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\\n\\n- A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\\n\\n- The eagle rays are a group of cartilaginous fishes in the family Myliobatidae, consisting mostly of large species living in the open ocean rather than on the sea bottom.\\n\\n- In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard).\\n\\n- Dasyatis ( Greek \`\` dasys '' meaning rough or dense and \`\` batus '' meaning skate ) is a genus of stingray . The members of the genus Neotrygon were formerly included in Dasyatis .\\n\\n- Myliobatiformes is one of the four orders of batoids, cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. They were formerly included in the order Rajiformes, but more recent phylogenetic studies have shown the myliobatiforms to be a monophyletic group, and its more derived members evolved their highly flattened shapes independently of the skates.\\n\\n- Stingrays are a group of rays, which are cartilaginous fish related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).\\n\\n- The whiptail stingrays are a family, the Dasyatidae, of rays in the order Myliobatiformes. They are found worldwide in tropical to temperate marine waters, and a number of species have also penetrated into fresh water in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Members of this family have flattened pectoral fin discs that range from oval to diamond-like in shape. Their common name comes from their whip-like tails, which are much longer than the disc and lack dorsal and caudal fins. All whiptail stingrays, except the porcupine ray (\\"Urogymnus asperrimus\\"), have one or more venomous stings near the base of the tail, which is used in defense. They range in size from or more across.\\n\\n- A whip is a tool, in various forms, traditionally designed to strike animals or people, or both, in order to control and punish. The capacity to inflict pain is the most instrumental property of a whip, although many animal-goading whips are used simply to tap the creature and provide guidance, as in dressage. Whips fall generally into two categories: firm, at most moderately flexible stick-like forms used to strike directly; and highly-flexible whips, with or without an inflexible hand, that require a specialised swing or \\"crack\\" motion to use. This second category can exert greater force and typically has a longer range. \\n\\n- Urotrygonidae is a family of rays in the order Myliobatiformes, commonly referred to as the American round stingrays or round rays. They are native to the tropical and warm temperate marine waters of the Americas. The two genera in this family were formerly placed within the family Urolophidae, whose species are now restricted to the Indo-Pacific. They have a round pectoral fin disk, a slender tail with a caudal fin, no dorsal fins, and a venomous tail spine.\\n\\n- The Urolophidae are a family of rays in the order Myliobatiformes, commonly known as stingarees or round stingrays; this family formerly included the genera \\"Urobatis\\" and \\"Urotrygon\\" of the Americas, which are presently recognized as forming their own family Urotrygonidae. Stingarees are found in the Indo-Pacific region, with the greatest diversity off Australia. They are sluggish, bottom-dwelling fish that have been recorded from shallow waters close to shore to deep waters over the upper continental slope. Measuring between long, these rays have oval to diamond-shaped pectoral fin discs and relatively short tails that terminate in leaf-shaped caudal fins, and may also have small dorsal fins and lateral skin folds. Most are smooth-skinned, and some have ornate dorsal color patterns.\\n\\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\\n\\n- River stingrays or freshwater stingrays are Neotropical freshwater fishes of the Potamotrygonidae family in the order Myliobatiformes, one of the four orders of batoids, cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. River stingrays are found in rivers in South America draining into the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean as far south as the River Plate in Argentina (freshwater stingrays in Africa, Asia and Australia are in another family, Dasyatidae). Each river system has its own endemic stingrays. A single marine genus, \\"Styracura\\", of the tropical West Atlantic and East Pacific are also part of Potamotrygonidae. They are generally brownish, greyish or black, often with a mottled or speckled pattern, have discs ranging from in diameter and venomous tail stingers.

The style was defined primarily by the deep basslines and \\"squelching\\" sounds of the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.\\n\\n- Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.\\n\\n- Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.\\n\\n- The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- Breakbeat as a term refers to one of two distinct things. Originally it would have referred only to \\"A breakbeat\\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except for the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \\"Breakbeat\\" (2), characterized as a genre of groove-oriented music which utilizes a lo-fi sampled breakbeat (or combination of breakbeats) for the main drum beat, and usually incorporates other lo-fi sampled \\"hits\\" as well.\\n\\n- Palm Pictures is a US-based entertainment company owned and run by Chris Blackwell.

Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as \\"English-speaking blacks from Barbados\\" like Grandmaster Flash, \\"black Jamaicans\\" like DJ Kool Herc, \\"thousands of Nuyoricans\\", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify.\\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat entity does 'divine operating system' has the relation 'record label' with?","target":"palm pictures","rationale":"The answer is palm pictures."},{"source":"I've always wondered: The 'God particle' is more technically called what, after two (English and Indian) physicists?","target":"Higgs event","rationale":"The 'God particle' is more technically called the Higgs event, after two (English and Indian) physicists."},{"source":"OPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no\\nDoes \\"Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages.\\" correctly answer the question of What was the name of the economic system that organized peasants into villages owing labor and rent to nobles?","target":"yes","rationale":"The passage mentions two of the ways in which society was organized during this time period.

Passage 1:Zuhayr belonged to the Bali tribe, itself part of the larger Quda'a confederation that was present throughout Syria and the northern Hejaz. He is considered by some Muslim sources, namely Ibn Hajar and al-Suyuti, as a sahabi (companion) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, while al-Suyuti also places him with the second-generation of Muslims, known as the tabi'un. According to Ibn Hajar, Zuhayr participated in the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 639. He later served as a lieutenant commander in the army of Uqba ibn Nafi during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 670. In that campaign, he played a role in the capture of Sirte and was made its governor. The Arabs established the town of Kairouan in Ifriqiya to garrison their troops and families and when Uqba advanced west of Kairouan, Zuhayr accompanied him. As Uqba campaigned in the region of Sous (in modern-day Morocco), he ordered Zuhayr to return with the majority of the Arab troops to Kairouan to defend the city from an impending Byzantine attack. \\n Passage 2:The discovery of the triode's amplifying ability in 1912 revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of electronics, the technology of active (amplifying) electrical devices. The triode was immediately applied to many areas of communication. Triode \\"continuous wave\\" radio transmitters replaced the cumbersome inefficient \\"damped wave\\" spark gap transmitters, allowing the transmission of sound by amplitude modulation (AM). Amplifying triode radio receivers, which had the power to drive loudspeakers, replaced weak crystal radios, which had to be listened to with earphones, allowing families to listen together. This resulted in the evolution of radio from a commercial message service to the first mass communication medium, with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920. Triodes made transcontinental telephone service possible. Vacuum tube triode repeaters, invented at Bell Telephone after its purchase of the Audion rights, allowed telephone calls to travel beyond the unamplified limit of about 800 miles. The opening by Bell of the first transcontinental telephone line was celebrated 3 years later, on January 25, 1915. Other inventions made possible by the triode were television, public address systems, electric phonographs, and talking motion pictures.\\n Passage 3:The Strategic Air Command (SAC) initially operated DC-130s assigned to its 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (100 SRW) at Davis–Monthan AFB, Arizona from 1966 through 1976.

Fram left Christiania on 24 June 1893, seen on her way by a cannon salute from the fort and the cheers of thousands of well-wishers. This was the first of a series of farewells as Fram sailed round the coast and moved northward, reaching Bergen on 1 July (where there was a great banquet in Nansen's honour), Trondheim on 5 July and Tromsø, north of the Arctic Circle, a week later.

Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned.

A. Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team.\\n\\nTittle threw the ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, something novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness--for which he was frequently referred to as the \\"Bald Eagle\\"--he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that he became one of the best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. \\"Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer,\\" said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:  I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy ... He and John, however, are entirely different types ... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players ... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play ... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy ... He tells you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.  Tittle's most productive years came when he was well beyond his athletic prime. On his ability to improve with age, he credited a feel for the game that came from his years of experience in the league. \\"If you could learn it by studying movies, a good smart college quarterback could learn all you've got to learn in three weeks and then come in and be as good as the old heads,\\" he told Sports Illustrated in 1963. \\"But they can't.\\"\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was his play style effective at first or did he have to work at it?","target":"Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release.","rationale":"The context in the article is a description of Tittle's style and abilities as a quarterback.

Indicate which: \\n Options:  <1> The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. <2> The enzymatic hepatic inducer drugs. <3> The infections <4> A restrictive diet in proteins. <5> The protease inhibitors used in HIV infection.","target":"4","rationale":"The acute porphyrias are a group of disorders caused by the deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis. The main clinical manifestations are abdominal pain, neuropathy and psychiatric symptoms, which appear mainly during periods of stress (eg infectious diseases, surgery or trauma). During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle there is an increase in progesterone levels that leads to an induction in hepatic drug metabolism with an increased catabolism and decreased plasma concentrations. Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes (such as rifampicin) may also precipitate attacks; therefore, they must be avoided. Infections increase porphyrin production due to activation of porphyrinogenic cytokines such as IL-1β and TNFα; however they can also be triggered by protease inhibitors used for HIV infections. A diet rich in proteins can trigger acute attacks since a metabolic blockage occurs when large amounts accumulate upstream from this step causing overproduction of precursors (porphobilinogen) on this pathway leading to attacks. A low protein diet is recommended because it reduces the load on ALA synthase and PBG dehydrogenase , thus reducing attack severity; In addition, there is indirect evidence that α-aminolevulinic acid may cause neuropathic pain through excitotoxicity . Therefore option 4 (a restrictive diet in proteins) is not true and so should be selected as correct answer"},{"source":"In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Passage:Aphra Behn (; bapt. 14 December 1640 – 16 April 1689) was an English playwright, poet, translator and fiction writer from the Restoration era. As one of the first English women to earn her living by her writing, she broke cultural barriers and served as a literary role model for later generations of women authors. Rising from obscurity, she came to the notice of Charles II, who employed her as a spy in Antwerp. Upon her return to London and a probable brief stay in debtors' prison, she began writing for the stage. She belonged to a coterie of poets and famous libertines such as John Wilmot, Lord Rochester. She wrote under the pastoral pseudonym Astrea. During the turbulent political times of the Exclusion Crisis, she wrote an epilogue and prologue that brought her into legal trouble; she thereafter devoted most of her writing to prose genres and translations. A staunch supporter of the Stuart line, she declined an invitation from Bishop Burnet to write a welcoming poem to the new king William III.

His parents, Louis and Mary Pihos, were Greek immigrants. In August 1937, when Pihos was 13 years old, his father, the operator of an all-night restaurant in Orlando, was murdered. His body was discovered behind the counter of the restaurant with his skull fractured in 12 places.\\n\\nPihos was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round (41st overall pick) of the 1945 NFL Draft, but he continued to play for Indiana in 1945 and 1946. In February 1947, he signed to join the Eagles after his graduation in June. In his first NFL season, he caught 23 passes for 382 yards and seven touchdowns. He also blocked a punt by Sammy Baugh and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown against the Washington Redskins.  The Eagles made it to the NFL Championship Game in each of Pihos' first three seasons with the team. In 1947, the team captured its first division championship. In the playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers for the Eastern Division title, Pihos blocked a punt to set up the first touchdown in the Eagles' 21-0 win. The Eagles then lost 28-21 to the Chicago Cardinals in the 1947 NFL Championship Game. Pihos caught three passes for 27 yards in that game and intercepted a pass while playing defense. The Eagles then won consecutive NFL championship games in 1948 and 1949. Pihos scored the only offensive touchdown of the 1949 championship game via a 31-yard reception in the second quarter during a heavy downpour.  Pihos' 766 receiving yards and 11 receiving touchdowns in 1948 were both the second-most in the NFL that season. He earned first-team All-Pro recognition in 1948 from United Press (UP), New York Daily News, Chicago Herald-American, and Pro Football Illustrated and in 1949 from the International News Service, UP, Associated Press, and New York Daily News. He was invited to his first of six-straight Pro Bowls after the 1950 season. In 1951, Pihos led the Eagles in receptions and receiving yards and intercepted two passes as a defensive end.  Pihos caught only 12 passes and scored only one touchdown in 1952, causing the Eagles front office to suspect he was washed up. However, he still managed to make the Pro Bowl and earn first-team All-Pro honors by the AP as a defensive end. Not willing take a pay cut and be an exclusive defensive end, Pihos trained heavily during the off-season prior to 1953. He went on to have his greatest statistical success over the next three seasons, which were ultimately his final three; he recorded similar statistics over that three-year span (185 receptions, 2,785 yards, and 27 touchdowns) to his first six seasons (188 receptions, 2,834 yards, and 34 touchdowns). Pihos led the NFL in receptions in each of his final three seasons, in receiving yards twice, and in receiving touchdowns once. In 1953, he became the third different player to record a \\"triple crown\\" in receiving; he led the NFL in receptions (63), receiving yards (1,049), and receiving touchdowns (10) that season.  In November 1955, Pihos announced that the current season would be his last as a player. In his final NFL game, on December 11 against the Chicago Bears, he caught 11 passes for 114 yards. He retired after playing in the Pro Bowl that January, in which he caught four passes and scored the East's first touchdown by out-leaping defender Jack Christiansen to snag a 12-yard pass from Eddie LeBaron.

In Tahitian mythology, Oviri was the goddess of mourning. She is shown with long pale hair, and wild eyes, smothering a wolf with her feet, while clutching a cub in her arms. Art historians have presented multiple interpretations—usually that Gauguin intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self-image as a \\"civilised savage\\". Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894, yet Gauguin romanticises the island's past as he reaches towards more ancient sources, including an Assyrian relief of a \\"master of animals\\" type, and Majapahit mummies. Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the Marquesas Islands, figures found at Borobudur, and a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in central Java.\\nGauguin made three casts, each in partially glazed stoneware, and while several copies exist in plaster or bronze, the original cast is in the Musée d'Orsay.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.\\n\\nThe purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.\\n\\nA risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

The psychologists wanted to see how many strangers would take the trouble to return them to the addresses listed on the drivers' licenses inside--but more than that, they wanted to find out what would make a person more likely to help out a stranger.\\nTo finish this, they included personal things in most of the wallets: some included a photo of a happy elderly couple, some contained a cute puppy, some contained a family portrait, and some held a photo of a lovely baby.

For reasons of cost and simplicity, most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature. Occasionally, a linear alternator or a rotating armature with a stationary magnetic field is used. In principle, any AC electrical generator can be called an alternator, but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines. An alternator that uses a permanent magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto. Alternators in power stations driven by steam turbines are called turbo-alternators. Large 50 or 60 Hz three phase alternators in power plants generate most of the world's electric power, which is distributed by electric power grids.\\n\\n- The Cheshire Plain is a relatively flat expanse of lowland almost entirely within the county of Cheshire in north-west England. It extends from the Mersey Valley in the north to the Shropshire Hills in the south, bounded by the hills of north Wales to the west and the foothills of the Pennines to the north-east. The Wirral Peninsula lies to the north-west whilst the plain merges with the South Lancashire Plain in the embayment occupied by Manchester to the north. In detail, the plain comprises two areas with distinct characters, the one to the west of the Mid Cheshire Ridge and the other, larger, part to its east.\\n\\n- The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England.\\n\\n- A dynamo is an electrical generator that produces direct current with the use of a commutator. Dynamos were the first electrical generators capable of delivering power for industry, and the foundation upon which many other later electric-power conversion devices were based, including the electric motor, the alternating-current alternator, and the rotary converter. Today, the simpler alternator dominates large scale power generation, for efficiency, reliability and cost reasons. A dynamo has the disadvantages of a mechanical commutator. Also, converting alternating to direct current using power rectification devices (vacuum tube or more recently solid state) is effective and usually economical.\\n\\n- Henry Wilde ( 1833 -- 28 March 1919 ) was a wealthy individual from Manchester , England who used his self - made fortune to indulge his interest in electrical engineering . He invented the dynamo - electric machine , or self - energising dynamo , an invention for which Werner von Siemens is more usually credited and , in fact , discovered independently . At any rate , Wilde was the first to publish , his paper was communicated to the Royal Society by Michael Faraday in 1866 . The self - energising dynamo replaces the permanent magnets of previous designs with electro - magnets and in so doing achieved an enormous increase in power . The machine was considered remarkable at the time , especially since Wilde was fond of spectacular demonstrations , such as the ability of his machine to cause iron bars to melt .\\n\\n- A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.\\n\\n- Magnetism is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys. The prefix \\"\\" refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, FeO.\\n\\n- Greater Manchester is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 2.8 million. It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Manchester and Salford. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972; and designated a City Region on 1 April 2011.\\n\\n- Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 . It lies within the United Kingdom's second-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.55 million. Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council.\\n\\n- Diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic field; an applied magnetic field creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of magnetic dipoles in the material. The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than , the permeability of vacuum. In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a superconductor acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.\\n\\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- Michael Faraday FRS (22 September 1791  25 August 1867) was an English scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis.\\n\\n- Manchester City Council is the local government authority for Manchester, a city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England. It is composed of 96 councillors, three for each of the 32 electoral wards of Manchester. The council is controlled by the Labour Party and led by Sir Richard Leese. Sir Howard Bernstein is the chief executive.

Health effects of over-illumination or improper spectral composition of light may include: increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety.[34][35][36][37] Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety.[38] For those who need to be awake at night, light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood.[39]","target":"Abe","rationale":"John was exposed to very strong light all the time, while Abe worked in a more normal environment.

Most current approaches learn to address this task in an end-to-end way with neural networks, without maintaining an explicit representation of the reasoning process. We propose a method to extract a discrete reasoning chain over the text, which consists of a series of sentences leading to the answer. We then feed the extracted chains to a BERT-based QA model to do final answer prediction. Critically, we do not rely on gold annotated chains or \`\`supporting facts:'' at training time, we derive pseudogold reasoning chains using heuristics based on named entity recognition and coreference resolution. Nor do we rely on these annotations at test time, as our model learns to extract chains from raw text alone.   We test our approach on two recently proposed large multi-hop question answering datasets: WikiHop and HotpotQA, and achieve state-of-art performance on WikiHop and strong performance on HotpotQA. Our analysis shows the properties of chains that are crucial for high performance: in particular, modeling extraction sequentially is important, as is dealing with each candidate sentence in a context-aware way.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.\\n\\n- Jive Records was an American record label under the RCA Music Group formed in 1981 by Zomba Records.

The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.\\",\\n\\nanswer the following question.

Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children.\\n\\nThompson was involved in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or temporary, admission to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore's criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's temporary admission to the state bar.  For his part, Thompson said he thought the judge was trying to protect Moore's criminal conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.  In the aftermath of this lawsuit, Thompson lobbied Alabama attorney general Troy King to file a civil suit and call on retailers not to sell \\"cop-killing games\\". After the slaying of another police officer in Gassville, Arkansas by Jacob D. Robida, an 18-year-old fugitive, Thompson again raised the possibility of a connection to Grand Theft Auto, but investigators found no evidence that video games were involved.\\n\\nWhat did Moore do?","target":"The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails.","rationale":"From the given context, it is clear that Devin Moore was involved in a similar suit. \\nThe opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails."},{"source":"Choose your answer: If \\"A busy street of people and two men are wearing no shirts.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A busy street of people and two men are wearing no shirts after leaving a bar.\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"it is not possible to tell","rationale":"While the premise states that there are shirtless men, it does not mention them leaving a bar.

At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike.

Cruella therefore mends her working relationship with her valet Alonzo and has him lock away all her fur coats. Cruella's probation officer, Chloe Simon, nevertheless suspects her, partly because Chloe is the owner of the now-adult Dipstick (one of the original 15 puppies from the previous film) who moved from Roger and Anita's house to her house.\\nDipstick's mate, Dottie, has recently given birth to three puppies: Domino, Little Dipper and Oddball (who lacks spots). To mend her reputation, Cruella buys the Second Chance Dog shelter, owned by Kevin Shepherd, to resolve its financial insolvency that is on the verge of eviction. Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy's subjects are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their original states but conceals this discovery. Inevitably, when Big Ben rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality and enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal 102 Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood, specifically modifying the original design to use Dipstick's children.","target":"Chloe","rationale":"The article mentions that Cruella is released into the custody of the probation office.

If food is plentiful, they can eat 10 times their own weight per day. While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on zooplankton (planktonic animals) ranging in size from the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as webs, some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled cydippid Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.","target":"jellyfish","rationale":"The correct answer is the only option that satisfies both the proper question and disfluent question.

Mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue, or pituitaries from euthyroid or hypothyroid mice, were incubated with D-[2-3H]Man, homogenized, and incubated in the presence or absence of pH 3 buffer to dissociate heterodimers. Highly enriched TSH beta-subunits, or TSH heterodimers, were obtained using anti-TSH beta serum and free alpha-subunits were subsequently obtained using anti-LH alpha-serum. High Man units released by endoglycosidase H were analyzed by paper chromatography. At 1 and 3 h oligosaccharides with 8 or 9 Man residues predominated in all subunits. In all three tissue types, units with 9 Man tended to accumulate in TSH beta-subunits, whereas Man-trimming from Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc proceeded more rapidly in TSH alpha-subunits, and in free alpha-subunits. The rate of TSH beta-subunit processing was also a function of tissue type; the rate in euthyroid pituitary tissue equaled that in tumor tissue and was greater than that in hypothyroid pituitary tissue, suggesting that processing may be physiologically regulated. Hypothyroid calf serum slowed TSH alpha-subunit processing in euthyroid pituitaries. Thus, the previously reported slower processing of Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc in heterodimers as compared to free alpha-subunits is in large part due to accumulation of Man9GlcNAc in TSH beta-subunits.","target":"Animal","rationale":"The abstract describes the structure of high mannose oligosaccharide units in the alpha- and beta-subunits of mouse TSH heterodimers and free alpha-subunits.

The IP test did not react with sera from either 15 speci¢c pathogen-free (SPF) dogs or 7 SPF dogs immunized with a multivalent vaccine, including canine parvovirus type 2, canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus type 2, and canine parain£uenza virus. To compare the IP test with the neutralizing test (NT), sera from 240 healthy dogs and from 3 experimentally CCV-infected dogs were examined. All 60 sera positive for NT antibody were positive for IP antibody, and all 180 sera negative for NT antibody were negative for IP antibody in the healthy dogs. The IP titres showed similar changes with time after CCV inoculation to those of the NT titres in the experimentally infected dogs. These ¢ndings indicate that the IP test speci¢cally detected anti-CCV antibodies. When the IP test and NT were compared in dogs with diarrhoeic signs. 2.1% of 48 sera and 20.3% of 74 sera, which were all negative for NT antibody, were positive for IP antibody in the dogs of under one year of age and at least one year of age, respectively. The di¡erence between the IP and NT titres (log 10 [reciprocal of IP titre]^log 10 [reciprocal of NT titre]) for the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age (2.350+0.931) was signi¢cantly larger than that for the healthy dogs (0.982+0.447) (p50.0001), the NT titre being negative or very low, despite a high IP titre in many diarrhoeic dogs. Hence, the IP test is more able to detect anti-CCV antibodies, especially in dogs showing clinical signs. The IP-positivity rate was signi¢cantly higher in the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age (48.7%) than in the healthy dogs (25.0%) (w 2 = 19.844, p50.0001), suggesting that CCV may contribute to diarrhoea in many juvenile dogs. \\n Title: Antibody testing against canine coronavirus by immunoperoxidase plaque staining","target":"True","rationale":"The title provides an accurate description of the research study conducted in this paper.

This differs from light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are somewhat simpler solid-state devices that emit a range of wavelengths and do so in many directions at once.  Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\\\\n\\\\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance.

Why is it called \\"shotgun\\" instead of just a \\"gun\\" or a more technical term (9-gauge, barrel gun etc.)? \\nAnswer: There are other things that shoot 'shot'.

Equipped with four independent electric motors and driving the four rear wheels, the Tesla Semi fully loaded will be able to reach 60 mph from a standing start in 20 seconds. Without a trailer attached? That number sheds to 5 seconds. In a Steve Jobs-ian “one more thing” kind of move, CEO Elon Musk made a semi-surprise announcement: Tesla will bring back a new version of its first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. It will be, of course, the world’s fastest car, Musk says, with a 0-60 time of less than 2 seconds. As with the Model 3, fans of the Tesla Semi can place a deposit – $5,000 down – against a purchase price that Tesla didn’t announce and a delivery date said to be in 2019. There are about 4 million big Class 8 tractors on the market now, with a quarter-million new tractors sold each year. 98 percent are diesel and most of the rest run on compressed natural gas. In a side-by-side comparison of how fast it takes a diesel truck to move 0-60, he showed how quickly the Tesla semi can hit it: 5 seconds. The interior offers one of the most striking features, up front. There’s center-mounted seating, like a McLaren F1. There are just so many interesting details to explore with the Tesla Semi, so we decided to highlight the five major ones that are most likely to get the people talking. Get the Flash Player to see this player. ALSO SEE: Tesla Semi Debuts With 500 Miles of Range, 80,000 lb Towing Capacity. Drives Briskly On a single charge, the Semi should be able to cover 500 miles of highway driving. It can also do this while towing at its maximum capacity of 80,000 lbs. A network of innovative solar powered Tesla charging stations will be installed worldwide to provide fast 30 minute charging for typical truck routes. In addition, up to 400 miles can be achieved after that 30 minute charge. A carbon fiber cab. A centrally-mounted driving position, like in a McLaren F1. A 500-mile range. Zero to 60 mph in five seconds. Semi-autonomous convoy capability. This is the Tesla Semi. Maybe Tesla will find some economies of scale, but the weight of the Tesla Semi is going to include at least five tons of lithium-ion batteries. In comparison, a 6 mpg diesel tractor-trailer would use about 600 pounds of fuel on a 500-mile trip. The Tesla Semi is also quick. Musk ran off these superlatives: The Tesla Semi will accelerate from 0-60 mph in five seconds, by itself, with no trailer. With the trailer and a full 80,000 pound load, it’s 20 seconds to hit 60 mph versus almost a minute for a diesel truck.

After the Battle of Mortimer's Cross, the future King Edward IV of England marched and took the capital from the Lancastrians. Parliament voted an attainder on his opposition, and John declared a traitor. The effect of the attainder was to terminate the Barony of Okehampton (creation 1299), so that the Earldom inherited from the Redvers family was in abeyance, passing laterally to the descendants of Courtenay's sisters The new King, Edward IV, marched north and sealed his reign with the bloody victory at the Battle of Towton, following which his brother was beheaded.

For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant.\\nQuestion: What is traditionally expected of a dinner guest?\\nOptions:\\n\\nA.

The first quarter ended equal for both teams, as both sides exchanged a couple of punts. Seattle took their third drive of the game in the second quarter, and drove into the red zone, capping it with a Steven Hauschka 27-yard field goal. Carolina responded immediately, and taking advantage of a couple of Seattle penalties, and some big runs by DeAngelo Williams, with Cam Newton hitting Steve Smith for a 3-yard TD. Seattle responded with a drive to around the Carolina 27 yard line, but Charles Godfrey sacked Russell Wilson and stripped the football, which Carolina recovered. So the first half ended 7-3, Carolina. The second half began with a defensive battle between both sides. Seattle then broke the deadlock with a Steven Hauschka 40-yard field goal, on a drive that lasted over 4 minutes, cutting the lead to 7-6. After forcing Carolina to punt midway through the fourth quarter, Seattle's offense produced its finest drive of the day. A couple of Russell Wilson passes, followed by a Robert Turbin 15-yard scamper, set up Seattle at the Panthers' 43 yard line. Russell Wilson overthrew receiver Stephen Williams on first down, but on second down and 10, by using exactly the same play, Wilson connected with second-year man Jermaine Kearse for a 43-yard score, with 10 minutes left to play. They failed the two-point conversion however, so Seattle had a 12-7 lead. Carolina responded by using DeAngelo Williams on some big runs.

Evans preferred to remain in Rome, so Etty travelled alone, pausing briefly in Florence and in Ferrara (where he stopped to kiss the armchair of Ludovico Ariosto). The painter Charles Lock Eastlake, then resident in Rome, had provided Etty with a letter of introduction to Harry D'Orville, British Vice consul in Venice; D'Orville was so impressed with Etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house, rather than in lodgings. Etty had long considered Venice his spiritual home and \\"the hope and idol of my professional life\\", and had often wondered why, given its artistic importance, so few English travellers visited the city. He was not disappointed. Throughout the remainder of his life, he looked back on his visit to Venice with great fondness, writing shortly before his death that \\"Venezia, cara Venezia! thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now!\\"Although Etty had only intended to stay for 10 days, he was so taken with Venice that he remained for over seven months. He fell into a routine of copying paintings in Venetian collections by day, and attending the life class of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts by night, producing around 50 oil paintings in total as well as numerous pencil sketches. He was extremely impressed with the high quality of the Venetian Academy; the instructors in their turn were extremely impressed with the quality of Etty's work, in particular his flesh tones. He acquired the nickname of \\"Il Diavolo\\" owing to the high speed at which he was able to paint, and watching him at work became something of a spectacle in its own right; luminaries including Gioachino Rossini and Ladislaus Pyrker (then Patriarch of Venice) came to watch him paint.

During Alma-Tadema's four years as a registered student at the Academy, he won several respectable awards.  Before leaving school, towards the end of 1855, he became assistant to the painter and professor Louis (Lodewijk) Jan de Taeye, whose courses in history and historical costume he had greatly enjoyed at the Academy. Although de Taeye was not an outstanding painter, Alma-Tadema respected him and became his studio assistant, working with him for three years. De Taeye introduced him to books that influenced his desire to portray Merovingian subjects early in his career. He was encouraged to depict historical accuracy in his paintings, a trait for which the artist became known.  Alma-Tadema left Taeye's studio in November 1858 returning to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where he began working with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio was one of the most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: The Education of the children of Clovis (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese.  Alma-Tadema took this criticism very seriously, and it led him to improve his technique and to become the world's foremost painter of marble and variegated granite. Despite any reproaches from his master, The Education of the Children of Clovis was honorably received by critics and artists alike and was eventually purchased and subsequently given to King Leopold of Belgium.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he paint anything while there?","target":"he won several respectable awards.","rationale":"The correct answer is \\"he won several respectable awards.\\""},{"source":"Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"Virtually all faculty members at Washington University engage in academic research,[citation needed] offering opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students across the university's seven schools.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"How does the Center for Measuring University performance rank Washington University?\\"\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- no","target":"no","rationale":"The question asks about the Center for Measuring University performance rank Washington University, whereas this sentence only provides some information on faculty members at Washington university.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head.

Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing.

Its use is of concern to ophthalmologists when ocular surgery is being considered and also in the presence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).   \\n OBJECTIVE To examine the association of regular aspirin use with incidence of AMD.   \\n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Beaver Dam Eye Study, a longitudinal population-based study of age-related eye diseases conducted in Wisconsin. Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period (1988-1990 through 2008-2010). Study participants (N = 4926) were aged 43 to 86 years at the baseline examination. At subsequent examinations, participants were asked if they had regularly used aspirin at least twice a week for more than 3 months.   \\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incidence of early AMD, late AMD, and 2 subtypes of late AMD (neovascular AMD and pure geographic atrophy), assessed in retinal photographs according to the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System.   \\n RESULTS The mean duration of follow-up was 14.8 years. There were 512 incident cases of early AMD (of 6243 person-visits at risk) and 117 incident cases of late AMD (of 8621 person-visits at risk) over the course of the study. Regular aspirin use 10 years prior to retinal examination was associated with late AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.01-2.63]; P = .05), with estimated incidence of 1.76% (95% CI, 1.17%-2.64%) in regular users and 1.03% (95% CI, 0.70%-1.51%) in nonusers. For subtypes of late AMD, regular aspirin use 10 years prior to retinal examination was significantly associated with neovascular AMD (HR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.20-4.15]; P = .01) but not pure geographic atrophy (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.25-1.95]; P = .45). Aspirin use 5 years (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.71-1.05]; P = .13) or 10 years (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.65-1.13]; P = .28) prior to retinal examination was not associated with incident early AMD.   \\n CONCLUSIONS Among an adult cohort, aspirin use 5 years prior to observed incidence was not associated with incident early or late AMD. However, regular aspirin use 10 years prior was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of incident late and neovascular AMD.","target":"Long-term use of aspirin and age-related macular degeneration","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nLong-term use of aspirin and age-related macular degeneration"},{"source":"Given a text passage as input comprising of dialogue of negotiations between a seller and a buyer about the sale of an item, your task is to classify the item being sold into exactly one of these categories: 'housing', 'furniture', 'bike', 'phone', 'car', 'electronics'.

Their distinctive funk style drew on psychedelic culture, outlandish fashion, science-fiction, and surreal humor; it would have an influential effect on subsequent funk, post-punk, hip-hop, and post-disco artists of the 1980s and 1990s, while their collective mythology would help pioneer Afrofuturism. The collective's origins date back to the doo-wop group the Parliaments, formed by Clinton in the late 1950s in Plainfield, New Jersey. Under the influence of late-1960s artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and Frank Zappa, Clinton later relocated to Detroit and began the sister groups Parliament and Funkadelic, with the former playing an eclectic and more commercial form of funk, and the latter incorporating more influence from psychedelic rock.\\n\\nIn the early 1980s George Clinton continued to record while battling with financial problems and well-publicized drug problems. The remaining members of Parliament-Funkadelic recorded the 1982 hit album Computer Games, which was released as a George Clinton solo album. Included on this release was the much-sampled #1 hit single \\"Atomic Dog\\". The following year, Clinton formed the P-Funk All Stars, who went on to record Urban Dancefloor Guerillas in 1983. The P-Funk All Stars included many of the same members as the late-1970s version of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, and was so named because of various legal issues concerning use of the names Parliament and Funkadelic after 1980. The name P-Funk All Stars is still in use to the current day, and group has included a mix of former Parliament-Funkadelic members as well as guests and new musicians.  As the 1980s continued, P-Funk did not meet with great commercial success as the band continued to produce albums under the name of George Clinton as solo artist. P-Funk retired from touring from 1984 until 1989, except for extremely sporadic performances and TV appearances. It was at this time that Hip hop music began to extensively sample P-Funk music, so remnants of the music were still heard regularly, now among fans of Hip hop. By 1993, most of the Parliament and Funkadelic back catalog had been reissued. The same year saw the return of a reconstituted P-Funk All Stars, with the re-release of Urban Dancefloor Guerrillas under the title Hydraulic Funk, and a new hip hop influenced album Dope Dogs. In 1994, the group toured with the Lollapalooza festival and appeared in the film PCU.  The 1996 album T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M. (The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership), released under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras, such as Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and Junie Morrison. It would be ten years before another album would be released. In the intervening time, successive tours would slowly restore some of the broken ties between the original band members, together with an accumulation of new talent. On July 23, 1999, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, including noteworthy former members Bootsy and Catfish Collins and Bernie Worrell, performed on stage at Woodstock '99. The collective continued to tour sporadically in to the 2000s, with participation from some of the children and grandchildren of the original members.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: did this album make any top charts?","target":"served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras,","rationale":"The answer is located in the context of this paragraph:\\n\\"In 1996, after a ten-year hiatus from recording music together, Clinton and Bootsy Collins worked on new tracks to include on what would become T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M (The Awesome Power of A Fully Operational Mothership), released under the name George Clinton & The P Funk All Stars.[16] This album served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras, such as Bernie Worrell.\\"[17]"},{"source":"In this task, you are given an utterance, which is a part of a conversation between a user and an agent.

They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area.

However, it has been observed that BN is costly due to the reduction operations. In this paper, we propose alleviating the BN’s cost by using only a small fraction of data for mean & variance estimation at each iteration. The key challenge to reach this goal is how to achieve a satisfactory balance between normalization effectiveness and execution efficiency. We identify that the effectiveness expects less data correlation while the efficiency expects regular execution pattern. To this end, we propose two categories of approach: sampling or creating few uncorrelated data for statistics’ estimation with certain strategy constraints. The former includes “Batch Sampling (BS)” that randomly selects few samples from each batch and “Feature Sampling (FS)” that randomly selects a small patch from each feature map of all samples, and the latter is “Virtual Dataset Normalization (VDN)” that generates few synthetic random samples. Accordingly, multi-way strategies are designed to reduce the data correlation for accurate estimation and optimize the execution pattern for running acceleration in the meantime. All the proposed methods are comprehensively evaluated on various DNN models, where an overall training speedup by up to 21.7% on modern GPUs can be practically achieved without the support of any specialized libraries, and the loss of model accuracy and convergence rate are negligible. Furthermore, our methods demonstrate powerful performance when solving the well-known “micro-batch normalization” problem in the case of tiny batch size.","target":"We propose accelerating Batch Normalization (BN) through sampling less correlated data for reduction operations  with regular execution pattern, which achieves up to 2x and 20% speedup for BN itself and the overall training, respectively","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe propose accelerating Batch Normalization (BN) through sampling less correlated data for reduction operations  with regular execution pattern, which achieves up to 2x and 20% speedup for BN itself and the overall training, respectively."},{"source":"In this task, you are given two strings A, B.

According to his later account, when two of his guests asked him about the possibility of organising a sea excursion, he put them in touch with Bown. On the evening of Saturday 30 July, amid celebrations following England's victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, Bown and his friend Jeffrey Stock, a qualified engineer, visited Greatwood. They found that enthusiasm for a sea trip had spread to many of the guests, and an agreement was made to take a large party to Fowey the following day. Different accounts were given later of the financial basis for the proposed hire – whether it was to be a fixed charge or a rate per head is uncertain.Barratt, the boat's legal owner, professed ignorance of the arrangements made at Greatwood, believing, he said, that Bown had gone there to discuss with Rainbird future charter work once the necessary licences had been obtained. Under local regulations, a licence for carrying up to 12 passengers was subject to examination of the boat by the harbourmaster, who would also require the person in charge to be a licensed skipper. Vessels proposing to carry more than 12 passengers needed a licensed master, a qualified marine engineer, and a Class III Passenger Certificate from the Board of Trade. This certificate was only granted to vessels in good condition with watertight hull compartments, a two-way radio, a qualified radio operator and a range of safety devices. Darlwyne had no radio, no distress flares, and carried only two lifebelts.

Just after its appearance, Costello was replaced by Lindsay McDougall on lead guitar and backing vocals - Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. In November, the group issued a CD EP, Punch in the Face and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the US supporting Blink-182.  In September 1997, their third LP, Meet the Family, was released, which reached the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and became their first certified gold album by ARIA. It spawned three singles, \\"Mr Charisma\\" (June), \\"There's Your Dad\\" (September), and \\"Mum Changed the Locks\\" (April 1998). The latter title refers to McDougall telling his mother he was going out to a movie when leaving for an interstate tour and returning to find his key no longer opened the front door. Also in April, Gordon \\"Gordy\\" Forman replaced Nykyruj on drums, and they toured Australia with US ska band Blue Meanies. Frenzal Rhomb were the head-liners for the Australian leg of the 1998 Vans Warped Tour and they were recruited for the US edition. A 1998 version of Meet the Family contained a bonus disc, Mongrel, that was recorded live on this US leg.

Passage:Afterwards Dashwood took eight American merchantmen, and on 15 June 1812, he captured the Hope, a merchant ship off the north of Gothland. On 14 August 1812 he was appointed captain of HMS Cressy of 74 guns, and given a piece of plate by the officers of HMS Pyramus. After serving in the North Sea under Admiral Sir William Young, Dashwood escorted a convoy to the West Indies, whence he returned with another of equal importance. At the review of the fleet at Spithead, in the summer of 1814, he steered the Royal barge. Afterwards he took part, commanding HMS Norge of 74 guns, in the Battle of New Orleans, where he assisted Admiral Pulteney Malcolm in the debarkation of the army, being reported by Sir Alexander Cochrane. He was also present at the Battle of Lake Borgne, where a few gunboats of the Norge, in company with other small vessels, captured five American gunboats. In 1815, when at anchor in Port Royal, his ship was struck by lightning, which broke the main-topgallant-mast in three pieces, shivered the maintop-mast and brought the mizentop-mast and topgallant-mast down on to deck. In 1821 he was given command of HMS Windsor Castle of 74 guns, and HMS Impregnable, of 104 guns, as Cochrane's flag-captain. He recommissioned Windsor Castle on 4 January 1822, as part of the guard-ships in Hamoaze. In 1825 he was put onto half-pay, and was made a rear-admiral on 22 July 1830. He assumed the rank of vice-admiral on 23 November 1841. Charles died while at service, on 21 September 1847. Consequently, on 22 September 1847, the Admiralty promoted him posthumously to the rank of admiral.","target":"b","rationale":"The passage mentions the name of Dashwood and Norge, but no other names.

Passage:San Severo lies on the Daunia, and various Neolithic settlements have been detected. In the early Middle Ages, the area was not inhabited or defined. Between the Lombards and the Byzantine ages, the Benedictine monastery at Cassino was established, and with it, the cult of the apostle of Saint Severinus of Noricum. San Severo was founded in the 11th century around a small church built by the Benedictine monks from Montecassino. It rapidly developed as a trade town. In 1053, it was the scene of the historical victory of Robert Guiscard over the papal troops under Pope Leo IX (see Battle of Civitate). In the eleventh century, San Severo was the route of the Via Sacra Langobardorum and a primitive church arose dedicated to Saint Severino, from which continued an influx of pilgrims to Monte Sant'Angelo and movement of people and goods.

Venous thrombi were demonstrated in ovarian, iliofemoral, and inferior vena caval vessels. In six women with ovarian vein involvement and no evidence of iliofemoral thrombophlebitis, resolution followed intravenous antimicrobial therapy alone, and in three of these, resolution was confirmed by x-ray tomography. In contrast, three of five women with symptomatic iliofemoral thrombophlebitis had a prolonged febrile course despite antimicrobial and heparin therapy. The clinical courses of these 11 women were consistent with the observation that pelvic thrombophlebitis is associated with pelvic infection. Disease manifested within a few days after parturition was more likely due to ovarian vein involvement, whereas disease with later onset of symptoms was more likely due to iliofemoral thrombosis, with or without vena caval extension.

Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. \\n\\n- The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties.\\n\\n- A land grant is a gift of real estate  land or its use privileges  made by a government or other authority as an incentive, means of enabling works, or as a reward for services to an individual, especially in return for military service. Grants of land are also awarded to individuals and companies as incentives to develop unused land in relatively unpopulated countries; the process of awarding land grants are not limited to the countries named below. The United States historically gave out numerous land grants as Homesteads to individuals desiring to prove a farm. The American Industrial Revolution was guided by many supportive acts of legislatures (for example, the Main Line of Public Works legislation of 1826) promoting commerce or transportation infrastructure development by private companies, such as the Cumberland Road turnpike, the Lehigh Canal, the Schuylkill Canal, and the many railroads that tied the young United States together.\\n\\n- West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.\\n\\n- Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word \\"Connecticut\\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \\"long tidal river\\".\\n\\n- Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.\\n\\n- African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War.\\n\\n- Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.\\n\\n- Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".\\n\\n- A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated.\\n\\n- Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music (cross-rhythm), or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm.\\n\\n- Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.\\n\\n- New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana.

While growing up in Connecticut , Jerry began his musical studies at the age of 12 . He performed in a variety of marching bands , drum corps , jazz bands , brass quintets , classical orchestras , and later earned degrees in Performance and Music Education at the University Of Connecticut . Beginning in the early 1980s , Zigmont \`\` cut his teeth '' playing club dates and concerts in regional jazz groups throughout New England . In 1987 he began an association with the celebrated British clarinetist , Sammy Rimington which resulted in a series of recordings and tours . Jerry 's rousing style has been featured with many noted New Orleans jazz luminaries including Doc Cheatham , Percy Humphrey and Arvell Shaw . Jerry Zigmont is a regular member of Woody Allen and his New Orleans Jazz Band which plays every Monday evening at Manhattan 's Carlyle Hotel . His trombone playing is steeped in the classic New Orleans tradition , with its trademark raw power and \`\` straight from the heart '' approach . He appears on the soundtrack of the documentary film Wild Man Blues ( directed by Barbara Kopple ) which documents a 1996 European tour by Allen and his band . Zigmont has performed extensively with the group in Europe , South America , Turkey and Greece .\\n\\n- Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.\\n\\n- The University of Connecticut (UConn) is a land grant public research university in Storrs, Connecticut, United States. It was founded in 1881, and is a sea-grant university and a member of the Space Grant Consortium. The university serves more than 32,000 students on its five campuses, including more than 8,000 graduate students in multiple programs.\\n\\n- Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'jerry zigmont' exhibits the relationship of 'place of birth'.

Medical imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones, as well as to diagnose and treat disease. Medical imaging also establishes a database of normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities. Although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are usually considered part of pathology instead of medical imaging.\\n\\n- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.\\nWhile the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others.\\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence.\\nRA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed...\\n\\n- Replacement arthroplasty (from Greek \\"arthron\\", joint, limb, articulate, + \\"plassein\\", to form, mould, forge, feign, make an image of), or joint replacement surgery, is a procedure of orthopedic surgery in which an arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface is replaced with an orthopedic prosthesis. Joint replacement is considered as a treatment when severe joint pain or dysfunction is not alleviated by less-invasive therapies. During the latter half of the 20th century, rheumasurgery developed as a subspecialty focused on these and a few other procedures in patients with rheumatic diseases.\\n\\n- Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected.\\nCauses include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red.\\nTreatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects.

Bouchard 's nodes are comparable in presentation to Heberden 's nodes , similar osteoarthritic growths on the distal interphalangeal joints , but are significantly less common .\\n\\n- Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present.\\nThe cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present.\\nThe treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage.\\nFibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males.

It is organisms, whether single- or multi-cellular, that produce new organisms. As we will discuss in detail when we consider the origins of multicellular organisms, a cell within a multicellular organism normally cannot survive outside the organism nor can it produce a new organism - it depends upon cooperation with the other cells of the organism. In fact, each multicellular organism is an example of a cooperative, highly integrated social system. The cells of a typical multicellular organism are part of a social system in which most cells have given up their ability to reproduce a new organism; their future depends upon the reproductive success of the organism of which they are a part. It is the organism’s success in generating new organisms that underlies evolution’s selective mechanisms. Within the organism, the cells that give rise to the next generation of organism are known as germ cells, those that do not (that is, the cells that die when the organism dies) are known as somatic cells.47 All organisms in the modern world, and for apparently the last ~3.5-3.8 billion years, arise from a pre-existing organism or, in the case of sexually reproducing organisms, from the cooperation of two organisms, an example of social evolution that we will consider in greater detail in Chapter 4. We will also see that breakdowns in such social systems can lead to the death of the organism or the disruption of the social system. Cancer is the most obvious example of an anti-social behavior; in evolutionary terms, it can, initially, be rewarded (more copies of the cancerous cell are produced) but ultimately leads to the extinction of the cancer, and often the death of the organism within which the cancer occurs.48 This is because evolutionary mechanisms are not driven by long term outcomes, but only by immediate ones.

The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go.

The first and foremost political division of the Isabeline era was between Carlists and Cristinos (or Isabelinos), the former being supporters of Infante Carlos, Count of Molina, a rival claimant to the throne and the latter being supporters of Maria Christina and Isabella. The former supported absolute monarchism and the traditionalism of the Antiguo Régimen (\\"Old Regime\\"); they were uniformly close to the Roman Catholic Church, and generally clericalist. The latter were generally supporters of constitutional monarchy (although some, including Maria Christina herself, were more inclined toward enlightened absolutism); they were liberals of one stripe or another, ranging from liberal conservatives and those whose liberalism was strictly economic to social liberals. In the 1830s, these two groups faced off in the First Carlist War, which the Cristinos won. The terms of surrender—notably the Convention of Vergara—left an opportunity for relatively moderate Carlists to continue to play a role in the country's politics, and many did so over the ensuing decades.","target":"b","rationale":"The passage does not mention the age of the queen mother when she began serving as regent.

A couple things, for context:\\n\\n-Their lessons are on Saturdays, when I teach for 12 hours straight with a 45 minute lunch break (if I'm lucky and don't have to teach a make-up class to anybody). \\n\\n-Their lessons are my final lessons on Saturdays.\\n\\n-Florence and I have discussed moving them to another day in the past, but so far no slots have worked for both of us. \\n\\n-Florence knows I work long hours on Saturdays.\\n\\n-Florence has also, repeatedly, attempted to talk me down to charging a quarter of my usual hourly rate (because her kids are so great, don't you know).\\n\\nSo I refused, and fairly forcefully so. I told her that it seemed that she did not respect my time at all, and suggested a break. I'm actually kind of hoping that she just won't call me back, ever...","target":"no","rationale":"The author refused to change the lesson time, which was 24 hours before the next lesson. The parent asked for a time change less than 24 hours in advance, which is not unreasonable. However, the author has done numerous lessons with this student and has previously discussed changing times with them. It seems that they would have been aware of other schedule conflicts well before now and could have planned accordingly. The author's refusal to move their schedule seemed a bit extreme given that it wasn't an unreasonable request on behalf of the student's parent. Therefore, we are confident in saying that this answer is \\"no\\"."},{"source":"You are given a math word problem and you are supposed to apply a single mathematical operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division on the numbers embedded in the text to answer the following question and then only report final the numerical answer.\\n\\nRoden went to a pet shop .

Passage: are three views of Mare Tranquillitatis on the Moon, taken by the mapping camera of the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, facing south-southwest from an average altitude of 111 km on Revolution 36 of the mission. At the left is the east side of Mare Tranquillitatis, with the craters Franz (bottom right), Lyell (dark floor, right of center), and Taruntius (upper left). The \\"bay\\" of dark mare (basalt) at left is Sinus Concordiae, with \\"islands\\" of older, light highland material. At the right is the crater Cauchy, which lies between the Rupes Cauchy and Cauchy rille. The center photo shows the central mare with craters Vitruvius (lower right) and Gardner (bottom center). At the horizon are lighter highlands at the southern margin of the mare, near the Apollo 11 landing site. The crater Jansen is visible at the edges of both the center and right photos. The right photo shows the western mare, with the craters Dawes (lower left) and the large Plinius (43 km diameter), with the Plinius Rilles in the foreground. These photos were taken within minutes of each other as the command module America orbited the Moon. The Sun elevation drops from 46 degrees at left to 30 degrees at right.\\n Links: a. Apollo 11 b.
