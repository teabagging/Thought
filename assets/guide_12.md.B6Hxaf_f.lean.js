During his life, he worked as a poet, essayist, journalist, translator, professor, and publisher. He was very politically active, and is considered an important revolutionary philosopher and political theorist. Through his writings and political activity, he became a symbol of Cuba's bid for independence against Spain in the 19th century, and is referred to as the \\"Apostle of Cuban Independence.\\"\\n\\nThe modernists, in general, use a subjective language. Marti's stylistic creed is part of the necessity to de-codify the logic rigor and the linguistic construction and to eliminate the intellectual, abstract and systematic expression. There is the deliberate intention and awareness to expand the expressive system of the language. The style changes the form of thinking. Without falling into unilateralism, Marti values the expression because language is an impression and a feeling through the form. Modernism mostly searches for the visions and realities, the expression takes in the impressions, the state of mind, without reflection and without concept. This is the law of subjectivity. We can see this in works of Marti, one of the first modernists, who conceives the literary task like an invisible unity, an expressive totality, considering the style like \\"a form of the content\\" (forma del contenido).  The difference that Marti established between prose and poetry are conceptual. Poetry, as he believes, is a language of the permanent subjective: the intuition and the vision. The prose is an instrument and a method of spreading the ideas, and has the goal of elevating, encouraging and animating these ideas rather than having the expression of tearing up the heart, complaining and moaning. The prose is a service to his people.  Marti produces a system of specific signs \\"an ideological code\\" (codigo ideologico). These symbols claim their moral value and construct signs of ethic conduct. Marti's modernism was a spiritual attitude that was reflected on the language. All his writing defines his moral world. One could also say that his ideological and spiritual sphere is fortified in his writing.  The difference between Marti and other modernist initiators such as Manuel Gutierrez Najera, Julian del Casal, and Jose Asuncion Silva (and the similarity between him and Manuel Gonzalez Prada) lies in the profound and transcendent value that he gave to literature, converting prose into an article or the work of a journalist. This hard work was important in giving literature authentic and independent value and distancing it from mere formal amusement. Manuel Gutierez Najera, Ruben Dario, Miguel de Unamuno and Jose Enrique Rodo saved the Martinian articles, which will have an endless value in the writings of the American continent.  Apart from Martinian articles. essay writing and literature starts to authorize itself as an alternative and privileged way to talk about politics. Literature starts to apply itself the only hermeneutics able to resolve the enigmas of a Latin American identity.\\n\\nwhat was the code for?","target":"These symbols claim their moral value and construct signs of ethic conduct.","rationale":"The question is about the code mentioned in the context. \\nIn this article, Marti produces a system of specific signs \\"an ideological code\\" (codigo ideologico).

The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than $450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The $175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied. Funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective orders remains in place, said Milne and Stewart Ralphs, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake. Although an order's requirements that an abuser stay away from a victim may remain in effect for years, protective orders only settle issues such as child...\\n\\nQuestion: Did the Office of Crime Victim Reparations vote to uphold the funding request and if not, why was the stopgap measure refused?\\nI found this answer \\"Not they did not\\".

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles.\\nIt is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.\\nTeasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates.

It’s long, I’m sorry. I’m trying to be thorough. \\n\\nA little backstory: shit’s been rough lately. I used to be very outgoing, very spunky, had many friends. I ran a small local business and was very involved in the community. I’ve never had many problems with friends before, at least not on my end (that anyone has told me about at least). I made friends relatively easily—though I was still picky and cautious about who I let get super close to me—and have never been the kind of girl who’s a gossip or has big falling outs with friends or lots of drama. For the most part, my friendships (definitely the close ones) last a long time...like years, decades long. \\n\\nBut almost three years ago I was in an accident and it fucked everything up. I broke my spine and got a brain injury. I’ve already had one surgery and we’re waiting on number two. I had to move back in with my parents and temporarily close my business. I cannot do a lot of basic things for myself...including bathing. It’s been extremely hard on me, not just physically, but also mentally. To add to the craziness, I was recently diagnosed with cancer, and then almost immediately after, sexually assaulted by my ex-boyfriend. It’s been a ride, y’all. \\n\\nBut over the last few months I’ve lost **everyone,** and I don’t know why. \\n\\nThree of my very best and closest girlfriends have straight up ghosted me. These girls helped me through my first surgery two years ago no problem. These were the girls who were my cheerleaders and helpers for my business, who threw me surprise birthday parties and called me when shit was going down in their lives. I thought we were ride or die. But when I asked girlfriend 1 (we’ll call her Micha) if she still had pictures of her wedding cake that I made for her a few years back, her answer was oddly distant and cold. When I tried to reply, I was blocked. No hints, no conversation, just blocked. \\n\\nI asked girlfriend 2 (let’s call her Kelly) about it to see if she knew what was wrong, and she brushed it off. “I think Micha was scared because you mentioned committing suicide (over a year ago).” This didn’t make any sense. Micha was the girlfriend I’d had the longest of the three, and she saw me through a horrible breakup in college where depression and suicide was mentioned. I did the same for her about a year later. That had never been a spooky topic before. And besides, that comment had happened over a year ago. I figured she just must need space and dropped it. \\n\\nThen maybe a month later, Kelly says life is too busy to continue talking to me, and she wants a break. She sends that message to me and at least one other mutual friend. I didn’t take it personally at the time because she was pulling away from everyone, not just me. I was concerned for her, but I wanted to respect her wishes so I told her that I loved her and whenever she was ready to chat and hangout again I would be here. \\n\\nBuuuut a month-ish after that is when my doctor first said “you might have cancer, I’m sending you to an oncologist.” I was freaked the fuck out. I felt so alone and scared and I didn’t want to tell my parents because it wasn’t a definite yet and I didn’t want to worry them. I needed my best friend so badly. So I called Kelly. She didn’t answer (which I expected), so I left her a tearful voicemail apologizing for calling and saying that I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful and invade her space, but the doc says I might have cancer and I was very scared. I just wanted a hug, honestly. She never returned my call. \\n\\nGirlfriend 3 (Nancy) moved to another state about a year ago, but we still stayed very close. Sending big birthday packages, long chats, lots of pictures back and forth and keeping each other very involved. She was supposed to be coming home soon and promised to visit, as my place is right down the road from her parents. But suddenly she stopped messaging too, around the same time as Kelly. I finally sent her a text that just said “Nancy, I have something important to tell you.” after the diagnosis was confirmed. She said “So do I. You go first.” I asked her if she could FaceTime, but she said she was still at work, so I said that was fine we can chat when she gets off or tomorrow, whatever works best for her. I never heard back. \\n\\nI sent all three girls a “wtf is going on” message one tearful night not too long ago. It was long, and probably overwhelming (in fact I sent an apology for the length the next day) but honestly, for a “best friend” it shouldn’t have been some crazy message. I told each of them my diagnosis and that I’m truly at the lowest of the low right now. I feel like I’m trapped in this shell of my body and there’s nothing I can do. I begged them to please tell me what I did wrong to make them ghost so I can fix it. I pleaded with each of them not to leave. But I also told them that they really hurt me, and I felt like I have been abandoned by those that I trusted the most during my deepest tome of need. I sent this individually over Facebook messenger because I naively thought that maybe I wasn’t getting replies because their phones were dead or something. I have been left on read for all three of them, and Micha deleted me as a friend immediately after reading my message. \\n\\nI don’t know what to do guys. All I can think of is that saying “if you keep smelling dog shit everywhere you go, maybe you should check your shoes.” Please tell me, AMITA? I’m so fucking mad at them. I would never straight up ghost a normal friend, never mind a best friend. *Especially* after they tell me that they have cancer, godfuckingdamn.

Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice.

Progesterone is similar in structure to aldosterone and can bind to and weakly stimulate aldosterone receptors, providing a similar but diminished response. Blood pressure is a reflection of blood volume and is monitored by baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses. When blood pressure increases, more action potentials are sent to the central nervous system, resulting in greater vasodilation, greater GFR, and more water lost in the urine. ANH is released by the cardiomyocytes when blood pressure increases, causing Na+ and water loss. ADH at high levels causes vasoconstriction in addition to its action on the collecting ducts to recover more water. Diuretics increase urine volume. Mechanisms for controlling Na+ concentration in the blood include the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and ADH. When Na+ is retained, K+ is excreted; when Na+ is lost, K+ is retained. When circulating Ca++ decreases, PTH stimulates the reabsorption of Ca++ and inhibits reabsorption of HPO 24 − . pH is regulated through buffers, expiration of CO2, and excretion of acid or base by the kidneys. The breakdown of amino acids produces ammonia. Most ammonia is converted into less-toxic urea in the liver and excreted in the urine. Regulation of drugs is by glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption.\\n\\n Choices:\\n\\n- hunger\\n\\n- air intake\\n\\n- temperature\\n\\n- blood pressure\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"blood pressure","rationale":"The question asks about the level in the body that is monitored by baroreceptors. Baroreceptors are activated when blood pressure increases and they send action potentials to the central nervous system, which causes vasodilation of arterioles and increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) leading to more water being lost via urine. Based on this description, it can be assumed that baroreceptors monitor changes in blood pressure and not any other levels such as hunger or temperature mentioned in answer choices A through C respectively. Therefore, choice D is correct since it states “blood pressure” and therefore option B is also wrong because air intake has nothing to do with regulating volume of fluids or composition thereof."},{"source":"Answer based on context:\\n\\nComing off their bye week, the Patriots returned home to face the Dolphins for the first time in the season. On the third play of the game, Brady attempted a deep pass to Moss; it was intercepted by rookie cornerback Vontae Davis at the Dolphins' 7-yard line and returned 15 yards. Six plays later, the Dolphins moved into Patriots territory on a 21-yard catch by tight end Joey Haynos from Chad Henne; after the catch, McGowan forced Haynos to fumble, but the ball went out of bounds at the spot of the catch, the Patriots' 39-yard line. On the next play, Henne appeared to have been strip-sacked by Banta-Cain, with linebacker Adalius Thomas returning it 59 yards for a touchdown. However, the Dolphins challenged that Henne's arm was moving forward and it was an incomplete pass and the play was reversed. Three plays later, a Dan Carpenter 52-yard field goal gave the Dolphins a 3-0 lead. The Patriots began their next drive at their own 37-yard line after offensive lineman Dan Connolly returned a short kickoff 16 yards. A few plays later, Brady connected with Moss on a 36-yard pass to the Dolphins' 1-yard line; Maroney then ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 7-3 lead. On the ensuing possession, Henne found his other tight end, Anthony Fasano on a 20-yard strike to move into Patriots territory, but a \\"Wildcat\\" formation run by Ricky Williams for a loss and a sack by Chung moved the Dolphins out of field goal territory and forced a punt. The Patriots advanced to the Dolphins' 42-yard line on their next drive before punting on the final play of the first quarter. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots began an 11-play, 49-yard drive that reached the Dolphins' 11-yard line on first down before a short pass, and incompletion, and sack led to a Gostkowski field goal; the 30-yarder put the Patriots ahead 10-3. The Dolphins introduced rookie quarterback Pat White on their next drive, employing him as part of an option offense that first had White run for a 33-yard gain and later in the drive had White option to Williams for a 15-yard touchdown run, tying the game. Following a 34-yard punt return by Tate, the Patriots quickly moved back into Dolphins territory on completions of 14 yards to Faulk and 23 yards to Watson. However, a Watson pass interference penalty on a 17-yard Faulk reception pushed the Patriots back to the Dolphins' 35-yard line. Gostkowski would later kick a 38-yard field goal to re-establish a Patriots lead at 13-10. On their next drive, the Dolphins would punt shortly after the two-minute warning, setting up a 10-play, 70-yard Patriots drive that ended the half with a 34-yard Gostkowski field goal after Brady was again sacked in the red zone. With possession and down 16-10 at the start of the third quarter, the Dolphins moved downfield on a 16-play drive that lasted more than ten minutes, eventually scoring on a 1-yard touchdown catch by Haynos from running back Ronnie Brown out of the \\"Wildcat,\\" giving the Dolphins a 17-16 lead. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected on a 71-yard touchdown pass and then again on the two-point conversion to re-take the lead at 24-17. The Dolphins would continue to employ both White and the \\"Wildcat\\" on their next drive, but it resulted in a Brandon Fields punt early in the fourth quarter. An exchange of punts consumed the next six minutes of the game, with the Dolphins choosing to use all three of their timeouts to gain back possession with 3:38 left. However, three straight incompletions and a penalty set up fourth down, when Henne again was unable to complete a pass from his own 27-yard line. The Patriots re-gained possession and ran the ball three times before Gostkowski kicked a 40-yard field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-17. The game would end four plays later on a 23-yard Greg Camarillo reception to the Patriots' 23-yard line.

We've been married about 8 years. More importantly, I don't know what perspective is the healthiest to take on this.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nExample: tonight, my wife (47), mother-in-law, son (5) and I (45) are getting ready to have dinner. Like the previous poster, I do enjoy cooking; I like to experiment and hate using recipes. Sometimes, I lose- big time, but usually, I can do a pretty good job of making something delicious and healthy.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, about a year ago, my son (5yr) was diagnosed Celiac, and about 6 months after, I figured out that my 30 year gut problem is an IBS caused by onion, garlic, and all kinds of other foods containing fructans. Those foods containing gluten (a protein) also have these fructans (a sugar), so wheat, barley, rye- my son and I both get hit. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI don't think my problem goes beyond serious, explosive, burning, toilet discomfort for a couple days, but my son truly will have problems if he ingests more than a sugar packet's worth of gluten in a year (put your knife in peanut butter, wipe it on your 'regular' bread, go back to the peanut butter jar with the knife, guess what's now in the peanut butter- whatever kind of bread you spread it on next).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, as soon as I found out about my son's celiac, I cleaned the house of gluten. Anything remotely suspect, I put in boxes intending to give away. Wife came home; within an hour most everything was back on the shelves. Perhaps I over-reacted, I'm not sure.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward about 8 months. We now often just prepare three meals for dinner. My son, being five, well he'd likely get his own meal in any case, not just because the gluten thing, but also, he's five.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy wife though, she insists on buying both regular and gluten-free, well just about everything.  So, we have gluten, and gluten-free peanut butter, gluten and gluten-free butter, gluten and gluten-free breads. Still gotta use the same toaster and all though. She made pizzas the other day using her bread-maker. One gluten-free pizza for the boy and I, a 'regular' one for her and our guests. Using the same bread-maker she'd been using for years. A sugar packet's worth of the gluten molecule, remember. But maybe I'm over-reacting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway- things are settling to where I cook meals and my wife does dishes/cleanup (I hate dishes- hate it- and I do it 'wrong' anyway too often). She'll still make meals occasionally too.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, my wife has a thing with beef- I can't pin down her reason though, because it often changes. For years, the reason was that cows produce methane, take up too many resources, bad for environment, etc. But then I pointed out her milk drinking habit, and the fact that there were more buffalo in North America before the slaughter than there are cows now, and that they share a similar physiology, etc. So now her reason seems to have switched to that it 'makes her feel bad'. Though I still hear the environmental piece from time to time. She has no problem with other meats- birds, pigs, fish, not much a fan of lamb or goat though.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut she'll eat the beef pot pies her mother makes. And she'll eat beef other times at her parents' house, or at other's houses.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo tonight, I go to make dinner for myself, my wife and my mother-in-law.  I decided to season some ground bison (having this onion/garlic thing, I've got to create all my own seasonings from scratch- EVERY seasoning mix has onion or garlic powder). Then I put it over rice and made a tomato-cucumber-corn salsa to put over top of that (because, again- I defy you to go find a salsa without onions or garlic).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd it's good- it's really, really good. But my wife won't have any of it. Because I used the bison ground beef. She said last time she tried it, she had too much and it made her feel bad.  So instead, we just get in each other's way in our cramped kitchen while she prepares an entirely different meal using nothing I had prepared tonight except the rice. The meal she decided to have was my leftover veal-tomato-sweet potato crock pot disaster that I don't intend to have another bite of myself, I'm so disappointed with it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn any case, when the meal was over, my mother-in-law said, 'Thanks, that was good.'. And I said, 'Thanks, I'm glad somebody enjoyed it.\\" My wife said, \\"You didn't like it?\\" I said, \\"No, it was great!\\".  She again said something about how last time she tried the bison she, 'Didn't feel good'. Then she proceeds to take another bite of the vegetables she'd picked out of the crock pot veal leftovers. Knowing full well that veal is cow.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis kind of behavior, is regular. When she makes me salads with the bitter, yucky plant leaves I just don't like, I eat them. I might complain a little, but I don't just make my own meal instead.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo folks, AITA for sitting here feeling bad because I live in a family that has to have three separate meals on a regular basis? Is this any different than the previous poster's situation with his fiance? Should I do more to cater to her choices of food items, when my son and I have diagnosed medical problems associated with foods that she refuses to adapt her own eating and grocery habits to?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPlease ask for clarifications if you need them- I'm not looking for validation here- I really don't know if I'm an asshole or not.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTL:DR- Wife prefers not to eat beef. I make family meals and will use bison or beef (usually bison if I can find it) maybe once a week or every other week, but my wife won't eat it and just makes her own meal instead. My son and I have diagnosed/medical food issues, but she brings the offending foods home anyway.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and Robert H.

Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.\\n\\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\n\\n- Al Green Explores Your Mind is the eighth album by soul singer Al Green .

Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany. A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum number of people in the shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar[citation needed]. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in Brierley Hill near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff. In the Manchester district the public bar was known as the \\"vault\\", other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere.

Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.\\n\\n- The Algiers Observatory was built in the late 19th century in the Algiers suburb of Bouzaréah, Algeria, North Africa. It participated in the Astrographic Catalogue project, taking the zone between -2 and +4 degrees to expose 1,260 plates between the years 1891 and 1911. At the tail end of that time, the director of the installation was François Gonnessiat. \\n\\n- The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km).\\n\\n- An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.\\n\\n- A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that\\nThe term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.\\n\\n- 1333 Cevenola, provisional designation , is a binary Eunomian asteroid from the asteroid belt, approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 20 February 1934, by French astronomer Odette Bancilhon at Algiers Observatory, Algeria in Northern Africa.\\n\\n- Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.\\n\\n- Bouzaréah is a suburb of Algiers, the capital of Algeria, North Africa, and its eleventh district. It had a population of 69,200 people in 1998 and an altitude of over 300 meters AMSL. The city's name is Arabic and means \\"of the grain\\" or \\"from the grain\\". The embassies of Niger, Oman, and Mauritania are located there.\\n\\n- François Gonnessiat (May 22, 1856 (Nurieux-Volognat)October 18, 1934) was a French astronomer, observer of comets and discoverer of two minor planets.\\n\\n- Algiers (\\"al-Jazer\\"; Algerian Arabic pronunciation:  Dzayer, ) is the capital and largest city of Algeria. In 2011, the city's population was estimated to be around 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population of the larger metropolitan city to be around 5,000,000.

In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics.;\\nQuestion: Which crown did the King of Scotland inherit in 1603?;\\nAnswer:","target":"Crown of England","rationale":"The context states that the King of Scotland inherited a crown in 1603.

The band's name is a play on 1960s rock band Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. The Flecktones formed in 1988 when Bela Fleck was invited to perform on the PBS TV series The Lonesome Pine Specials. The original members were Fleck on banjo, Victor Wooten on bass guitar, his brother Roy Wooten on Drumitar, and Howard Levy on harmonica and keyboards.\\nContext: Their debut album, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones (Warner Bros, 1989), received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, as did their second album, Flight of the Cosmic Hippo (Warner Bros., 1991), which also received a nomination for Best Instrumental Composition for the song \\"Blu-Blop\\". Their second album contained the Flecktones's version of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". Their next album had another cartoon cover and the palindromic title UFO TOFU (Warner Bros., 1992). The song \\"Bonnie & Slyde\\" had Fleck playing banjo atypically with a slide, an idea suggested to him by slide guitarist Bonnie Raitt.  UFO Tofu would be the last album the Flecktones recorded with their original lineup until Rocket Science in 2011. Howard Levy left the band in December 1992. While the departure of Levy was tough for the band, it was not unexpected. During their 1992 tour it became evident to the band that Levy was not happy with the rigors of touring and wanted to spend more time with his wife and children.  The remaining trio, consisting of Fleck and the Wooten brothers, recorded their fourth album, Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. \\"'Once we started rehearsing, everything was fine,' said Fleck. 'We started finding ways to sound good, and it was real exciting.'\\" Without Levy, the Flecktones as usual spent most of 1993 on the road and released Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in September of that year.  In July 1996 the Flecktones released their fifth album, and first live album, Live Art.

He is signed to WWE on a Legends contract. His best-known character is that of an American patriot, which sees him use a 2x4 length of wood as a weapon, the battle cry \\"Hooo!\\" and the U-S-A! cheer. In the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE), Duggan was the winner of the first ever Royal Rumble match in 1988 and in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), he was a one time United States Heavyweight Champion and a one time (and the final) World Television Champion.\\nContext: After he lost the U.S. title to Vader, Duggan moved to the mid-card division and began wrestling on Saturday Night. He defeated Bunkhouse Buck at SuperBrawl V. He faced former WWF rival Meng (known as Haku in WWF) in a martial arts match at Uncensored, which Meng won. At The Great American Bash, he defeated Sgt. Craig Pittman by disqualification in Pittman's pay-per-view debut. At Bash at the Beach (1995), Duggan lost to Kamala.  In late 1995, Duggan started a feud with Big Bubba Rogers, which culminated in a Taped Fist match at World War 3, which Rogers won. Duggan participated in the first-ever three ring, 60 man battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated. He fought Loch Ness to a double disqualification at a Main Event taping before SuperBrawl VI. Duggan then started a short feud with Diamond Dallas Page, to whom he lost in a Taped Fist match at Bash at the Beach. At World War 3, he unsuccessfully participated in a three ring 60 man battle royal to determine the #1 contender to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Duggan had no major pay-per-view matches for over two years before he disappeared in 1998 after he was diagnosed with kidney cancer.  After successfully beating his cancer, Duggan returned to wrestling and replaced Buff Bagwell in a match against Berlyn at Fall Brawl, which Duggan lost. Soon after, Duggan became involved in a storyline where he became a janitor for WCW. Duggan then started a feud with the anti-American stable the Revolution (Shane Douglas, Dean Malenko, Perry Saturn, and Asya). At Starrcade (1999), he and his surprise partners, the newly reunited Varsity Club (Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda, and Rick Steiner), faced the Revolution in a losing effort after the Club turned on Duggan. As a result of losing, the next night on Nitro, Duggan was forced to denounce the U.S. flag but he refused to do so.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.\\n\\n- Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean.

Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.","target":"False","rationale":"The abstract does not include a topic sentence or a closing sentence, so it is not structured.

Nothing in these sentences specifically indicates anything negative or positive would happen to Ted, so we must look at sentence 4 and 5 to determine what happens next in the story. Sentence 4 indicates something negative happened because it states \\"He slips and misses the shot.\\" However, this does not seem very significant because missing shots is part of basketball even for good players like Ted. In contrast, sentence 5 reveals something more serious has happened because it states \\"He hurts his ankle and is carried off the court.\\" Since this was unexpected, we can infer from this information that something bad has occurred to Ted during his game of basketball (i.e., getting hurt).

He forced Rhea Silvia, Numitor's daughter, to become a Vestal Virgin, a priestess of Vesta, so that she would never bear any sons that might overthrow him. However, she was raped or seduced by the god Mars, resulting in the birth of the twins. Rhea was thrown into prison and her sons ordered to be thrown into the river Tiber. The twins washed up onto dry land and were found by a she-wolf who suckled them. Later their mother was saved by the river god Tiberinus who ended up marrying her. Romulus and Remus went on to found Rome and overthrow Amulius, reinstating their grandfather Numitor as king of Alba Longa.","target":"a","rationale":"The question asks how long Amulius had been king before he was overthrown.

He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.\\n\\n- A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).\\n\\n- Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period.\\n\\n- The Prior Analytics is Aristotle's work on deductive reasoning, which is known as his syllogistic. Being one of the six extant Aristotelian writings on logic and scientific method, it is part of what later Peripatetics called the \\"Organon\\". Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Jan Lukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The Jan Lukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s in a series of papers by John Corcoran and Timothy Smileywhich inform modern translations of \\"Prior Analytics\\" by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009.\\n\\n- Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.\\n\\n- The 6th century BC started the first day of 600 BC and ended the last day of 501 BC.\\n\\n- Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. 200 AD) was a Peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the Ancient Greek commentators on the writings of Aristotle. He was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria, and lived and taught in Athens at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the Peripatetic school. He wrote many commentaries on the works of Aristotle, extant are those on the \\"Prior Analytics\\", \\"Topics\\", \\"Meteorology\\", \\"Sense and Sensibilia\\", and \\"Metaphysics\\". Several original treatises also survive, and include a work \\"On Fate\\", in which he argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity; and one \\"On the Soul\\". His commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, \\"the commentator\\".\\n\\n- Sosigenes the Peripatetic ( Greek :  ) was a philosopher living at the end of the 2nd century AD . He was the tutor of Alexander of Aphrodisias and wrote a work On Revolving Spheres , from which some important extracts have been preserved in Simplicius 's commentary on Aristotle 's De Caelo . He criticized both Aristotle and Eudoxus for their imperfect theory of celestial spheres and also the use of epicycles , which he felt to be inconsistent with Aristotle 's philosophical postulates . He pointed out that the planets varied markedly in brightness , and that eclipses of the sun are sometimes total and sometimes annular , suggesting that the distances between the sun , moon and earth were not the same at different eclipses . Sosigenes is perhaps called \`\` the Peripatetic '' only because of his connection with Alexander . Some ancient evidence may be taken to suggest that he was , in fact , a Stoic . As John Patrick Lynch has written : The other two teachers of Alexander may actually have been the philosophers whom ancient sources called Stoics ; in both cases , Herminos / Sosigenes \`\` the Stoic '' have been distinguished from Herminos / Sosigenes \`\` the Peripatetic '' only on the grounds that the two latter men were teachers of Alexander of Aphrodisias . But it is not improbable that Alexander of Aphrodisias studied with two Stoic teachers and that these two pairs of homonymous contemporaries are actually only two Stoic philosophers . He is often confused with the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria , who advised Julius Caesar on the reform of the Roman calendar .\\n\\n- Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens.

Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, \\"It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for $1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band.\\" Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed $800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.Slay Tracks was recorded during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, \\"You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top.\\" Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, \\"[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'\\" Kannberg said, \\"We did it really fast.

In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time.

Single-vessel disease was present in 64% of the patients and multivessel disease in 36%. The preceding myocardial infarction had been small to moderate in size in the majority of the patients. The left ventricular ejection fraction was more than 50% in 80% of the patients. Forty-five patients were refractory to pharmacologic treatment; eight were initially stabilized but once again became symptomatic with light exertion. Angioplasty was performed in 35 patients 2 to 14 days and in 18 patients 15 to 30 days after infarction (average 12 +/- 7 days after infarction). The initial success rate was 89% (47/53). The success rate of the patients treated at 2 to 14 days was lower (29/35, 83%) than that of patients treated at 14 to 30 days (18/18, 100%) but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .06). There were no deaths related to the procedure. In four of the six failures, emergency bypass surgery was performed and two patients sustained a myocardial infarction. Furthermore, a myocardial infarction complicated the angioplasty procedure in two other patients; thus the overall procedure-related myocardial infarction rate was 8% (4/53). At 6 months follow-up 26% (14/53) of all the patients who underwent angioplasty had recurrence of angina, which was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty, bypass surgery, or medical therapy. There were no late deaths. Late myocardial infarction occurred in two patients. Thus the total myocardial infarction rate after angioplasty at 6 months was 11% (6/53 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) \\n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Coronary angioplasty for early postinfarction unstable angina. option2: Perforation of duodenal ulcer following gastric exclusion operation for morbid obesity.","target":"Coronary angioplasty for early postinfarction unstable angina","rationale":"This paper describes a study in which coronary angioplasty was performed on 53 patients with unstable angina that had occurred within the first 30 days after sustained myocardial infarction.

Martinez works two jobs as a physician's assistant and supports his elderly parents and 8-year-old son. Uncommon Good has a 22-member board of doctors, lawyers and representatives of Christian groups and is recruiting mentors. One goal is to get the state Legislature to pass a law to provide loan forgiveness to medical professionals and lawyers who work with the poor. Mintie said she hopes her organization can be a national model for other professions. She is trying to bring legal aid services to the Inland Valley -- the closest legal aid office is in El Monte and represents 700,000 poor people throughout the San Fernando, San Gabriel and Inland valleys. \\"Unless the legal aid is in the community, you can't say you are serving the poor,\\" Mintie said.

His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.\\nAlthough Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

Countless conservative opponents of the Democrat-backed health care reform plans have used the word. Their argument goes like this: You get government more involved in running health care, you set a goal of reducing costs, and it will inevitably mean rationing of medical services. It's not a long road from there to images of Grandma being denied a life-saving operation as a cost-saving measure. Everyone from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to Sen. Chuck Grassley has warned that people have reason to worry about rationing, while Democratic proponents of the plan have dismissed the claims as uninformed fearmongering. The term rationing has become so ubiquitous in the health care debate, we could've chosen to fact-check statements from any number of politicians as a way to talk about this issue. In a separate item, we looked at a claim about rationing from House Republican Leader John Boehner. In this item, we opted for one from Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, if only because he was so definitive about a subject with a lot of gray. \\"\\"Let me just say, A, there's no rationing in any of these bills, so we don't have to worry about that,\\"\\" Dean said on ABC's  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  on Aug. 9. Before we examine his specific claim, let's look at the criticisms that have led to charges of rationing. The critics have often focused on two areas of the health plan to back up their accusations. The first is a proposal to expand comparative effectiveness research. That's a bureaucratic way of saying the government would do studies to find out which medical treatments and medications work better than others, and which are most cost-effective. The idea is that this would help doctors and patients make better informed decisions about the most effective treatment strategies. It's also expected to save money over time. Some opponents, however, claim the government would use findings from this research to ration care. We looked into this issue in detail and concluded that claim is    . Other opponents of the plan have pointed to the Obama administration's proposal for an Independent Medicare Advisory Council (IMAC). The board would make annual recommendations for changing federal payments for various services covered by Medicare, as well as recommendations on ways to reform the Medicare delivery system. Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argues that price controls recommended by IMAC's unelected board amount to implicit rationing. Judith A. Stein, director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a group that helps seniors get care under the federal program, doesn't agree. Stein is no fan of IMAC, but she said its goal is not to \\"\\"ration\\"\\" care but to seek out ways to improve the efficiency of Medicare services, not necessarily cut them. We note that while IMAC has been recommended by the Obama administration, it was not included in any of the House bills so far. It has been discussed as an option by the powerful Senate Finance Committee. Still, we think it's a little premature to suggest this is part of the health care reform plan. And we think claims that IMAC might lead to wholesale rationing are alarmist. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at the IMAC proposal and concluded it would save the government $2 billion from 2016–2019. That doesn't sound to us like the CBO expects any kind of dramatic cuts in service. In fact, we think much of the rhetoric from opponents about how the Democrats' health plan would lead to wholesale rationing has been wildly distorted, fanning the flames of public fear that the health care plan would have the government setting dollar limits on how much could be spent in a year to care for a patient, or deciding that some groups of people — older or disabled people, for example — should not get care because it's too expensive for the common good. And so it's understandable that Dean would want to knock down these wild claims. But we think Dean goes too far when he says the bills have \\"\\"no rationing,\\"\\" because it ignores a hard reality of health care — there is rationing now and there would be rationing in the Democrats' plan too. \\"\\"This whole notion of rationing as it applies to a public option, I think, is really ridiculous,\\"\\" Stein said. \\"\\"It is what insurance is. Right now, Congress and any health care plan 'rations.' No health insurance I know pays for 'whatever it costs.'\\"\\" \\"\\"Everyone hates the word rationing,\\"\\" said   Katherine Baicker,   a health economics professor at Harvard University. \\"\\"From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything.\\"\\" And you can bet people who can't get health insurance due to a pre-existing condition feel like there's already rationing. Ditto for those who can't afford health insurance. Proponents of the health reform plan — which seeks to provide basic coverage to everyone, regardless of whether they have a pre-existing condition — argue that it would clearly reduce that form of rationing. You could spend an unlimited amount on health care that would have some chance of helping people, Baicker said. But we have a limited amount of public resources. And so decisions have to be made about how to prioritize to allocate those resources. The idea, she said, is to provide adequate, basic health care in a public plan. Above that threshold, she said, people with more money could buy extra care. John Holahan, the director of the Urban Institute Health Policy Research Center, said he has not seen anything in any of the plans that will result in explicit rationing, but \\"\\"if you define rationing as 'people can't get everything they want,' it's true. But it's also true today.\\"\\" Interestingly, he said that Medicare is much less likely to deny a health service than a private insurer. \\"\\"That's the argument you hear people making (that the reform bills would lead to government rationing),\\"\\" Holahan said. \\"\\"But I think they have it backwards.\\"\\" Even Obama acknowledged the reality of health care rationing in a town hall on health care on Aug. 16: \\"\\"When we talk about reform, you hear some opponents of reform saying that somehow we are trying to ration care, or restrict the doctors that you can see, or you name it,\\"\\" Obama said. \\"\\"Well, that's what's going on right now. It's just that the decisions are being made by the insurance companies. \\"\\"Now, in fairness, we probably could not construct a system in which you could see any doctor anywhere in the world any time, regardless of expense. That would be a hard system to set up. So if you live in Maine, you know, we're going to fly you into California, put you up. I mean, you can see — and I'm not trying to make light of it — you can just see the difficulty. \\"\\"So any system we design, there are going to have to be some choices that have to be made in terms of where you go to see your doctor, what's going on, et cetera. That's being done currently in the private marketplace. All we're trying to do is to make sure that those decisions that are being made in the private marketplace aren't discriminating against people because they're already sick; that they are making sure that people get a good deal from the health care dollars that they are spending.\\"\\" In other words, rationing is just a fact of life in a world with limited resources. Or as Cato's Cannon puts it: \\"\\"Asking if there will be rationing under the Obama plan is like asking if there will be gravity. It is ubiquitous and unavoidable.\\"\\" We realize some may read our ruling and conclude that we believe the Obama plan will mean more drastic rationing. But we think it's more accurate to say the bill seeks a more rational way to ration. Whether it can succeed is a topic for legitimate debate. The Democrats' health care plan calls for a health care exchange that will be a vigorous marketplace of companies offering different plans that will compete for customers by offering more or less coverage. But each of those choices about coverage — a lower or higher cap on out-of-pocket expenses, perhaps, or more or less generous coverage for doctor visits — are rationing. And the same goes for three-fourths of Americans who would probably keep their current employer-sponsored health insurance. Those plans too have limits and caps — and rationing. We rule Dean's statement .\\" Claim: There's no rationing in any of these bills.","target":"0","rationale":"The claim states that \\"\\"There's no rationing in any of these bills.\\"\\" The paragraph describes the effects of various provisions proposed in the bill and explains how they would affect health care. The paragraph acknowledges that there is \\"\\"rationing now\\"\\" and also discusses various ways that rationing would occur under the current plan. It concludes by stating, \\"\\"We realize some may read our ruling and conclude that we believe the Obama plan will mean more drastic rationing. But we think it's more accurate to say the bill seeks a more rational way to ration.\\"\\" If a reader were to conclude from this passage that there is no rationing under the bill, then he or she would be wrong because there are several examples given in which services are limited or capped based on cost-effectiveness studies done by IMAC — all forms of rationing. Therefore, this contradicts with evidence present in the paragraph and hence should be classified as 0.\\""},{"source":"Article: The Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department.

During the summer, there are regular boat tours from Fårö Island and Nynäshamn on the mainland.\\n\\n- Old Gutnish was the dialect of Old Norse that was spoken on the Baltic island of Gotland . It shows sufficient differences from the Old West Norse and Old East Norse dialects that it is considered to be a separate branch . Gutnish is still spoken in some parts of Gotland and on the adjoining island of Fårö . The root Gut is identical to Goth , and it is often remarked that the language has similarities with the Gothic language . These similarities have led scholars such as Elias Wessén and Dietrich Hofmann to suggest that it is most closely related to Gothic . The best known example of such a similarity is that Gothic and Gutnish called both adult and young sheep lamb . The Old Norse diphthong au ( e.g. auga \`\` eye '' ) remained in Old Gutnish and Old West Norse , while in Old East Norse -- except for peripheral dialects -- it evolved into the monophthong  , i.e. a long version of ø .

Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect.

Despite this, current vaccination strategies need to be refined to successfully generate robust protective antigen-specific memory immune responses. To address this issue, one possibility is to exploit the high efficiency of dendritic cells (DCs) as antigen-presenting cells for T cell priming. DCs functional plasticity allows shaping the outcome of immune responses to achieve the required type of immunity. Therefore, the choice of adjuvants to guide and sustain DCs maturation, the design of multifaceted vehicles, and the choice of surface molecules to specifically target DCs represent the key issues currently explored in both preclinical and clinical settings. Here, we review advances in DCs-based vaccination approaches, which exploit direct in vivo DCs targeting and activation options. We also discuss the recent findings for efficient antitumor DCs-based vaccinations and combination strategies to reduce the immune tolerance promoted by the tumor microenvironment. FiGURe 1 | Dendritic cells (DCs) readapted taxonomy. Newly identified populations of blood human DCs are shown. DC1 subset is clearly distinct by the expression of CLEC9A, and it is specialized in cross-presentation of ags. DC2 and DC3 constitute the conventional DCs pool, even though they appear to be phenotypically slightly different and, upon stimulation with TLR ligands, their diversity emerges. DC4 is a population characterized by an upregulated Type I Interferon pathway for antiviral responses. DC5 has emerged as a new population whose specific functions are still unexplored. DC6 corresponds to the classic plasmacytoid DCs. These advances in the fine characterization of DCs in humans may shed light on the best subset to be targeted to incentivize the desired immune response. \\n Title: Dendritic Cells in the Cross Hair for the Generation of Tailored vaccines","target":"False","rationale":"The paragraph discusses advances in DCs-based vaccination approaches, which exploit direct in vivo DCs targeting and activation options.

Passage 1:Summerfield was born in Ivybridge, Devon and joined the Plymouth Argyle Centre of Excellence aged 10. He made his first-team debut in the last match of the 2004–05 season, a 0–0 home draw with Leicester City on 8 May 2005, entering the match as a 77th minute substitute for David Worrell. He signed a two-year professional contract with Plymouth on 1 August 2005, before the start of 2005–06. He made two appearances in his first two seasons for Argyle (both as a substitute), once in the league and once in the League Cup. Summerfield made his debut for Argyle, as a substitute, on 8 May 2005, against Leicester City. On his first start for Argyle, against Colchester United in the Championship, on 8 August 2006, during 2006–07, Summerfield scored with a long-range volley. In January 2007, Summerfield was listed at number five in The Guardian's ten best prospects to watch out for in 2007.\\n Passage 2:In March and April 1864, Shelby's men harassed and skirmished with the Union Army force under the command of Major General Frederick Steele during his Camden Expedition, part of the Red River Campaign. Gordon led more than one charge against the Union forces during Steele's march from Little Rock to Camden, Arkansas. On April 25, 1864, Gordon led his regiment at the Battle of Marks' Mills where they captured two Union artillery pieces from the detachment of Union Lieutenant Colonel Francis M. Drake when Shelby's force attacked the Union left wing of the detachment which had been sent from Camden toward Pine Bluff, Arkansas to obtained supplies for Steele's force which was increasingly besieged by gathering Confederate forces at Camden. The Confederates outnumbered the Union force at Marks' Mills by more than 2 to 1 and overwhelmed it, taking about 1,300 prisoners and about 240 wagons. The overall commander of the Confederate cavalry force at Marks' Mills, Brigadier General James Fagan, led the Confederates, including Shelby's command, toward Pine Bluff in an effort to capture the Union supply depot. The Confederates did not make it to Pine Bluff due to flooding. They also did not return fast enough to cut off Steele's return march to Little Rock or to participate in the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry, the one big engagement during the retreat before the Union troops escaped across the swollen Saline River.\\n Passage 3:Ximing Temple () was a famous temple in Chang'an, the capital of the Tang dynasty in Chinese history. Chang'an, current day Xi'an, was the eastern terminus of the Silk Road, and a cosmopolitan metropolis. Ximing was established by Tang Gaozong in 656. It was at Ximing that pilgrim and traveller Xuanzang (602-664) had translated the scriptures he had brought back from India. Another traveller Yijing (635-713) also based himself at Ximing while working on translations of Indian scriptures. Indian scholar monk Shubhākarasimha, was responsible for the introduction of the Mahavairocana Sutra and the tantric traditions associated with it. Japanese monk, Kukai studied Sanskrit there under the tutelage of Gandharan pandit Prajñā (734-810?) who had been educated at the Indian Buddhist university at Nalanda. Ximing was celebrated for its library which was the most comprehensive library of Buddhist texts in China at the time. Woncheuk (613–696) (Chinese Yuáncè) was a Korean Buddhist monk, also known as Ximing Fashi (西明法师) after the name of this temple where he did most of his important work.","target":"3","rationale":"The question asks when the dynasty which Chang'an served as a capital ended. Passage 3 talks about Ximing Temple which was in Chang'an and also has information about when it was established by Tang Gaozong, 656.

The other two passages are irrelevant to Chang'an and the question at hand."},{"source":"In this task, you are provided with an article of the legal acts.

Kronos and his companion, the hunchback Hieronymus Grost, are professional vampire hunters. Grost explains to the initially sceptical Marcus that the dead women are victims of a vampire who drains not blood but youth, and that there are \\"as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey.\\" The discovery of another victim confirms Grost's explanation. Along the way, Kronos and Grost take in a local barefoot girl, Carla, who had been sentenced to the stocks for dancing on the Sabbath. She repays them by helping them hunt the vampire; she later becomes Kronos' lover.\\nGrost and Kronos conduct a mystical test that indicates the presence of vampires. Their findings are contradicted by an eyewitness who claims to have seen \\"someone old, very old\\", whereas a youth-draining vampire should appear youthful.\\nMarcus visits the family of his late friend, Lord Hagen Durward, and speaks with Durward's son, Paul (Shane Briant), and his beautiful sister Sara (Lois Daine). He must leave before speaking with the bed-ridden Lady Durward. While riding through the woods, Marcus encounters a cloaked figure that leaves him shaken, and he finds blood on his lips.\\nAt a tavern, Kronos defeats thugs led by Kerro, who were hired by Lady Durward's coachman to murder him. Kronos, Grost, Marcus and Carla set up a network of alarm bells in the woods to announce the passage of vampires. Meanwhile, a large bat attacks and kills a young woman.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.\\n\\nNow, I have a new situation: Big town and Fair town both used petroleum products.

His Norwegian American mother, Margaret Ruth (nee Wiggum; March 23, 1919 - April 22, 2013), was once a teacher, and his German Canadian father, Homer Philip Groening (December 30, 1919 - March 15, 1996), was a filmmaker, advertiser, writer and cartoonist. Homer, born in Main Centre, Saskatchewan, Canada, grew up in a Mennonite, Plautdietsch-speaking family.\\n\\nAfter spending a few years researching science fiction, Groening got together with Simpsons writer/producer David X. Cohen (known as David S. Cohen at the time) in 1997 and developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000. By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and storylines; Groening claimed they had gone \\"overboard\\" in their discussions. Groening described trying to get the show on the air as \\"by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life.\\" The show premiered on March 28, 1999. Groening's writing credits for the show are for the premiere episode, \\"Space Pilot 3000\\" (co-written with Cohen), \\"Rebirth\\" (story) and \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela\\" (story).  After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox. In a situation similar to Family Guy, however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Adult Swim brought Futurama back to life. When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air Futurama reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films - Bender's Big Score (2007), The Beast with a Billion Backs (2008), Bender's Game (2008) and Into the Wild Green Yonder (2009) - would be produced.  Since no new Futurama projects were in production, the movie Into the Wild Green Yonder was designed to stand as the Futurama series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the Futurama franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film. In an interview with CNN, Groening said that \\"we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don't know... We're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can't tell if it's just me\\". Comedy Central commissioned an additional 26 new episodes, and began airing them in 2010. The show continued in to 2013, before Comedy Central announced in April 2013 that they would not be renewing it beyond its seventh season.

(\\"\\"Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili\\"\\" (Anonymous Lombard Automobile Factory) on June 24, 1910, in Milan  and involved in car racing since 1911.\\n\\n- A panel van (or panelvan) is a form of solid (rigid-bodied, non-articulated) van, smaller than a lorry or truck, without rear side windows. In the U.K., this body style is referred to as a \\"car-derived van\\", and in American as a \\"sedan delivery\\". Panel vans are widely used in many parts of the world for transporting cargo. In some national usages it is distinct from a purpose-designed van in that it is based on the chassis of a family car design. In places where they are distinct from a \\"van\\", they have less cargo space but better agility and maneuverability, making them particularly suited for cities with narrow streets and/or heavy traffic.\\n\\n- The Chrysler Drifter is an automobile which was produced by Chrysler Australia from 1977 to 1978 . It was offered in panel van and coupé utility body styles . Chrysler Australia added a panel van to their Chrysler CL Valiant range in April 1977 , and a few weeks later they introduced the \`\` Drifter Pack '' as an option on that body style . The Drifter Pack included a Chrysler Charger grille , quartz halogen high beam headlights , a sports steering wheel , radial ply tyres , styled wheels and special exterior paint and decal treatment with colour - coded bumpers . The 4.3 litre Hemi 265 engine and a four speed floor shift manual transmission were standard on the Drifter . In spite of its option pack status , Chrysler marketed the model as the Chrysler Drifter without using the name \`\` Valiant '' . The Drifter pack was also available on the Chrysler Valiant Utility , which was also marketed as the \`\` Chrysler Drifter '' . The Drifter styles of the panel van and utility body ended when Chrysler Australia discontinued the CL series . The 1978 CM Valiant range did not include these styles . The brief life of the Drifter was marked by low sales as competition from comparable offerings from Ford and Holden was stiff . Chrysler Australia also used the Drifter name on a special edition Charger Drifter , released in 1978 .\\n\\n- Jeep is a brand of American automobiles that is a division of FCA US LLC (formerly Chrysler Group, LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The former Chrysler Corporation acquired the Jeep brand, along with the remaining assets of its owner American Motors, in 1987. The division is headquartered in Toledo, Ohio. Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles and off-road vehicles, but has also included pickup trucks in the past.\\n\\n- A chassis (US English , UK English ; plural: \\"chassis\\" or ) consists of an internal vehicle frame that supports a manmade object in its construction and use, can also provide protection for some internal parts. An example of a chassis is the underpart of a motor vehicle, consisting of the frame (on which the body is mounted). If the running gear such as wheels and transmission, and sometimes even the driver's seat, are included, then the assembly is described as a rolling chassis.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'chrysler drifter' exhibits the relationship of 'manufacturer'.

He proposes; she accepts (\\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \\"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty. She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with a young Chinese woman in relative opulence. Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter in love with Kitty again assures her it doesn't matter. The cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control, completely due to his importation of clean water through a system of aqueducts (as the local people did not understand water-borne infectious disease[2][bettersourceneeded]) cholera carrying refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China. Five years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might have been the boy's father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away.

I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices.\\nArt blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to.\\nI’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas.

His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.\\nAs a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.

In May 2005, McCready was stopped by Nashville police for speeding, then arrested and charged with driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license.

Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified.

It includes the great majority of dinosaurs with armor in the form of bony osteoderms. Ankylosaurs were bulky quadrupeds, with short, powerful limbs. They are first known to have appeared in the early Jurassic Period of China, and persisted until the end of the Cretaceous Period. They have been found on every continent except Africa. The first dinosaur ever discovered in Antarctica was the ankylosaurian \\"Antarctopelta\\", fossils of which were recovered from Ross Island in 1986.\\n\\n- China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\\n\\n- The Yixian Formation is a geological formation in Jinzhou, Liaoning, People's Republic of China, that spans 11 million years during the early Cretaceous period. It is known for its exquisitely preserved fossils, and is mainly composed of basalts interspersed with siliciclastic sediments.\\n\\n- Beijing (formerly romanised as Peking) is the capital of the People's Republic of China and the world's third most populous city proper. It is also one of the world's most populous capital cities. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighbouring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China.\\n\\n- Antarctopelta (; meaning 'Antarctic shield') was a genus of ankylosaurian dinosaur with one known species, \\"A. oliveroi\\", which lived in Antarctica during the Late Cretaceous Period. It was a medium-sized ankylosaur, reaching no more than 4 meters (13 ft) in length, and showed characteristics of two different families, making more precise classification difficult. The single known fossil specimen was discovered on James Ross Island in 1986, constituting the first dinosaur remains ever discovered on Antarctica, although it is the second dinosaur from the continent to be formally named.\\n\\n- Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.\\n\\n- The Aptian is an age in the geologic timescale or a stage in the stratigraphic column. It is a subdivision of the Early or Lower Cretaceous epoch or series and encompasses the time from 125.0 ± 1.0 Ma to 113.0 ± 1.0 Ma (million years ago), approximately. The Aptian succeeds the Barremian and precedes the Albian, all part of the Lower/Early Cretaceous.\\n\\n- Manchukuo was a puppet state in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, which was governed under a form of constitutional monarchy. The area, collectively known as Manchuria by westerners and Japanese, was designated by China's erstwhile Qing Dynasty as the \\"homeland\\" of the ruling family's ethnic group, the Manchus, but the Manchus themselves never used \\"Manchuria\\" () as a place name to refer to the area. In 1931, the region was seized by Japan following the Mukden Incident and a pro-Japanese government was installed one year later with Puyi, the last Qing emperor, as the nominal regent and emperor. Manchukuo's government was abolished in 1945 after the defeat of Imperial Japan at the end of World War II. The territories formally claimed by the puppet state were first seized in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, and then formally transferred to Chinese administration in the following year.\\n\\n- Basalt (, , , or ) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows.\\n\\n- The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. \\n\\n- The Barremian is an age in the geologic timescale (or a chronostratigraphic stage) between 129.4 ± 1.5 Ma (million years ago) and 125.0 ± 1.0 Ma). It is a subdivision of the Early Cretaceous epoch (or Lower Cretaceous series). It is preceded by the Hauterivian and followed by the Aptian stage.\\n\\n- Liaoningosaurus is a very unusual ankylosaur from the Lower Cretaceous . The holotype IVPP V12560 ( Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology , Beijing ) , an essentially complete juvenile skeleton compressed on a slab , was collected from the Yixian Formation ( Aptian stage ) of Liaoxi , Yixian County , Liaoning Province , People 's Republic of China . The type species Liaoningosaurus paradoxus was named by Xu Xing , Wang Xiaolin and You Hailu in 2001 . The generic name refers to Liaoning . The specific name refers to the confusing mix of nodosaurid and ankylosaurid features shown by the specimen . The articulated skeleton measures approximately 34 cm in length , giving it the distinction of being the smallest - known ankylosaur specimen . The specimen is unique among all known ankylosaur fossils in the retention of the external mandibular fenestra . Antorbital fenestrae may also be present . Both are likely juvenile traits , just as the relatively large teeth , the retention of teeth in the praemaxilla , long feet , long lower legs and the possession of long sharp claws on the hand and feet . A real feature unique to the taxon , or autapomorphy might be the trapezoid form of the breast bone Another new feature is the presence of ventral armor plating , two very large paired osteoderms covering the entire abdomen and having a surface structure sculpted with small hexagonal and rhombic elevations . Such plates had never been found with other ankylosaurians , of which the belly armor is poorly known , however . Smaller triangular osteoderms were found on the shoulder , the scapula showing the onset of a shoulder spike . Determining the relations of Liaoningosaurus is difficult because of the young age of the individual specimen and the presence of traits both typical of ankylosaurids and nodosaurids . Xu et al . ( 2001 ) published a cladistic analysis , placing Liaoningosaurus basal within the Nodosauridae , while Vickaryous et al . ( 2004 ) have provisionally assigned it to the Ankylosauria...\\n\\n- Liaoning is a province of China, located in the northeast of the country. The modern province was established in 1907 as Fengtian or Fengtien province and the name was changed to Liaoning in 1929. It was also known as Mukden province at the time, for the Manchu pronunciation of Shengjing, the former name of the provincial capital Shenyang. Under the Japanese-puppet Manchukuo regime, the province reverted to its 1907 name but the name Liaoning was restored in 1945 and again in 1954.\\n\\n- The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).\\n\\n- Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).\\n\\n- The Albian is both an age of the geologic timescale and a stage in the stratigraphic column.

But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary.

One response to cold is shivering, which is random muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to generate heat. When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop significantly, red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of ATP production. This lack of oxygen can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death. The body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent blood from cooling there and so that the body’s core can stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains stable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers and toes, can develop frostbite when blood flow to the extremities has been much reduced.

Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he was one of the most popular entertainers in the world, and was the best-selling music artist during the year of his death. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5.\\nContext: Jackson was influenced by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: \\"Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.\\"  Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: \\"I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang - just the way she was.\\" He told her: \\"I want to be just like you, Diana.\\" She said: \\"You just be yourself.\\"  According to choreographer David Winters, who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \\"Beat It\\" and the \\"Bad\\" video.\\nQuestion: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?.

Passage:In 1996, Toyota Motor Sports funded the development of an experimental Le Mans Prototype, which was officially known as the TOM'S Toyota LMP. As Toyota were primarily focusing on their Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) engine, which first ran that year, the LMP project was run on a tight budget of approximately $500,000. Due to this tight budget, the car, christened the \\"Lumpy\\", reused Toyota's 3S-GT engine in the 88C Group C specification, which was a 2.1-litre turbocharged straight-four engine, producing ; this engine was coupled to an Xtrac gearbox from a Peugeot Group C car. The chassis tub was designed to be simple but strong, and the bodywork was also simple; the tight budget meant that the LMP never saw a wind tunnel. The bodywork was designed to minimize lift over the upper body of the car, and had much simpler brake cooling than on most Le Mans Prototypes; the radiator ducts were used, via a scoop, to cool the brakes. After the LMP was completed, Tom Kristensen tested it on at least one occasion, whilst project director Andy Thorby recalled it being tested a total of three times; he stated that the car was very reliable, had lower fuel consumption than the 88C Group C car had (with the same engine), and that it also appeared to be quick. Following the completion of the tests, the car was dispatched to Toyota Team Europe's Cologne workshop, stored under a tarpaulin and eventually destroyed.

He was the brother of Mary Fielding , the second wife of Hyrum Smith , and an uncle of Joseph F. Smith , the sixth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints . Fielding was born in Honeydon , Bedfordshire , England , to John Fielding and Rachel Ibbotson , who braved the scorn and persecution of the established church to become members of the Square Chapel Independent congregation , led by the famous Reverend Titus Knight , in their home town of Halifax , Yorkshire . James was christened there on 5 May 1793 . The family then moved to Honidon , Bedfordshire , where the Fielding family were active in the growing Methodist movement in the area . For many years they regularly walked the four miles to attend the Methodist chapel at St Neots . It is significant that of the ten children , at least eight were to spend their lives closely involved with the evangelism of the gospel , albeit within differing religions . James preached in first the Methodist Church , but became disaffected and , at the instigation of his brother - in - law the Reverend Timothy Matthews , went to Preston , accompanied by two of his sisters , Martha and Mary , to preach in the Semi-Episcopalian and Primitive Episcopalian churches . Martha Ibbotson Fielding married the Reverend Watson in Preston in 1836 . Thomas Fielding served the ministry in the Church of England , initially at Papworth under Mr Spurling , a priest .

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.\\n\\n- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the LDS Church or, informally, the Mormon Church) is a Christian restorationist church that is considered by its followers to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 74,000 missionaries and a membership of over 15 million. It is ranked by the National Council of Churches as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening.\\n\\n- The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) is one of the largest Mormon fundamentalist denominations and one of the largest organizations in the United States whose members practice polygamy. The FLDS Church emerged in the early 20th century when its founding members left The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The split occurred largely because of the LDS Church's suspension of the practice of polygamy and its decision to excommunicate its members who would continue the practice.\\n\\n- The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas.\\n\\n- Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.\\n\\n- Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.\\n\\n- The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine.

Collectively, these churches have over 15 million members. The vast majority of adherents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), with their predominant theology being Mormonism. The LDS Church self-identifies as Christian. A minority of Latter Day Saint adherents, such as members of the Community of Christ, believe in traditional Protestant theology, and have distanced themselves from some of the distinctive doctrines of Mormonism. Other groups include the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which supports lineal succession of leadership from Smith's descendants, and the more controversial Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which defends the practice of polygamy.\\n\\n- The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.\\n\\n- The Caucasus Mountains are a mountain system in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea in the Caucasus region.\\n\\n- Utah (or ) is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population of more than 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2016), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City. Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast.\\n\\n- Classical antiquity (also the classical era, classical period or classical age) is a term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, collectively known as the Greco-Roman world. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and Southwestern Asia.\\n\\n- Hyrum Smith (February 9, 1800  June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the original church of the Latter Day Saint movement. He was the older brother of the movement's founder, Joseph Smith.\\n\\n- Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.\\n\\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".\\n\\n- Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament.\\nVirtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.\\n\\n- The Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is a denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement. The president of the church is Frederick Niels Larsen, a direct descendant of Joseph Smith.\\n\\n- A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.\\n\\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\\n\\n- Salt Lake City, often shortened to Salt Lake or SLC, is the capital and the most populous municipality of the U.S. state of Utah. With an estimated population of 190,884 in 2014, the city lies at the core of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, which has a total population of 1,153,340 (2014 estimate). Salt Lake City is further situated within a larger metropolis known as the Salt Lake City-Ogden-Provo Combined Statistical Area. This region is a corridor of contiguous urban and suburban development stretched along an approximately segment of the Wasatch Front, comprising a total population of 2,423,912 . It is one of only two major urban areas in the Great Basin (the other is Reno, Nevada), and the largest in the Intermountain West.\\n\\n- The Ural or Jayq/Zhayyq (, ), known as Yaik before 1775, is a river flowing through Russia and Kazakhstan in Eurasia. It originates in the southern Ural Mountains and ends at the Caspian Sea. At , it is the third-longest river in Europe after the Volga and the Danube, and the 18th-longest river in Asia. The Ural River is conventionally considered part of the boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia.\\n\\n- The Turkish Straits are a series of internationally-significant waterways in northwestern Turkey that connect the Aegean and Mediterranean seas to the Black Sea.\\n\\n- Mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity. Joseph Smith founded the movement in Western New York in the 1820s. During the 1830s and 1840s, it distinguished itself from traditional Protestantism. Mormonism represents the non-Protestant faith taught by Smith in the 1840s. After he was killed in 1844, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the area that became the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Other sects include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy, and various other small independent denominations. The second-largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, since 2001 called \\"Community of Christ\\", does not describe itself as \\"Mormon\\", but instead follows a Trinitarian Christian restorationist theology, and also considers itself Restorationist in terms of Latter Day Saint doctrine.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between 'joseph fielding' and 'salt lake city'?","target":"place of death","rationale":"The relation is \\"place of death\\"."},{"source":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\n\\nLiving things with poor traits should produce more or less offspring than living things with better traits? \\n\\n\\nParagraph :\\n\\nNatural selection is the process by which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring, so their traits become more common over time.","target":"less","rationale":"Living things with poor traits should produce less offspring than living things with better traits.

The title refers to Abdülmecid I (18391861). There were different anthems for each sultan.\\n\\n- New Rome (Greek:  , \\"Nea Rom\\"; Latin: \\"Nova Roma\\") was a name given by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great in 330 AD to his new imperial capital at the city on the European coast of the Bosporus strait, also known as Byzantium until then, and as \\"Knstantinoúpolis\\" (Constantinople). The city is now known as Istanbul.\\n\\n- Primus inter pares (\\"prtos metax ísn\\") is a Latin phrase meaning first among equals. It is typically used as an honorary title for those who are formally equal to other members of their group but are accorded unofficial respect, traditionally owing to their seniority in office. Historically, the \\"princeps senatus\\" of the Roman Senate was such a figure and initially only bore the distinction that he was allowed to speak first during debate. Also, Constantine the Great was given the role of \\"primus inter pares\\". However, the term is also often used ironically or self-deprecatingly by leaders with much higher status as a form of respect, camaraderie, or propaganda. After the fall of the Republic, Roman emperors initially referred to themselves only as \\"princeps\\" despite having power of life and death over their \\"fellow citizens\\". Various modern figures such as the Chair of the Federal Reserve, the prime minister of parliamentary regimes, the Federal President of Switzerland, the Chief Justice of the United States, and the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church fall under both senses: bearing higher status and various additional powers while remaining still merely equal to their peers in important senses.\\n\\n- The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror.\\n\\n- France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.\\n\\n- The Tanzimât (Ottoman Turkish: , \\"Tanmt\\"), literally meaning \\"reorganization\\" of the Ottoman Empire, was a period of reformation that began in 1839 and ended with the First Constitutional Era in 1876. The \\"Tanzimât\\" reform era was characterized by various attempts to modernize the Ottoman Empire and to secure its territorial integrity against nationalist movements from within and aggressive powers from outside of the state. The reforms encouraged Ottomanism among the diverse ethnic groups of the Empire, attempting to stem the tide of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire.\\n\\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\\n\\n- The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\". \\n\\n- Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish:    \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him.\\n\\n- Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish:   \\"Mahmud-u sn\\",   \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785  1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I.\\n\\n- The ecumene (US) or oecumene (UK \\"oikoumén\\",  \\"inhabited\\") was an ancient Greek term for the known world, the inhabited world, or the habitable world. Under the Roman Empire, it came to refer to civilization and the secular and religious imperial administration. In present usage, it is used as the noun form of \\"ecumenical\\" and describes the Christian Church as a unified whole or the unified modern world civilization. It is also used in cartography to describe a type of world map (\\"mappa mundi\\") used in late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.\\n\\n- Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\\n\\n- Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.\\n\\n- Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike.\\n\\n- Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. \\n\\n- The Council of Chalcedon (or ) was a church council held from October 8 to November 1, AD 451, at Chalcedon. The Council is numbered as the fourth ecumenical council by the Great Church. A minority of Christians do not agree with the council's teachings. Its most important achievement was to issue the Chalcedonian Definition. The Council's judgements and definitions regarding the divine marked a significant turning point in the Christological debates. Chalcedon was a city in Bithynia, on the Asian side of the Bosphorus; today the city it is part of the Republic of Turkey and is known as Kadköy (a district of Istanbul).\\n\\n- Anthimos V ( Greek :   ' ) was Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople for thirteen months from 1841 to 1842 . He was born in Raidestos ( Tekirda ) and served as Metropolitan of Agathoupolis between 1815 and 1821 , Anchialos between 1821 and 1831 , and Kyzikos between 1831 and 1841 . He was appointed Ecumenical Patriarch when Patriarch Anthimos IV was dismissed by Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I. He died in 1842 and was succeeded by Germanos IV.\\n\\n- The Ecumenical Patriarch (\\"His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch\\") is the Archbishop of ConstantinopleNew Rome and ranks as \\"primus inter pares\\" (first among equals) among the heads of the several autocephalous churches that make up the Eastern Orthodox Church, and is widely regarded as the representative and spiritual leader of the 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. The term \\"Ecumenical\\" in the title historically referred to the Ecumene, a Greek designation for the civilised universe, i.e. the Roman Empire, and legally stems from Canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon.\\n\\n- The Crimean War was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to March 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a \\"greater confusion of purpose\\", yet led to a war noted for its \\"notoriously incompetent international butchery.\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'anthimus v of constantinople' with the relationship of 'place of death'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1923\\n - africa\\n - alliance\\n - anatolia\\n - battle\\n - bithynia\\n - central\\n - chalcedon\\n - constantine\\n - constantinople\\n - english channel\\n - france\\n - french republic\\n - imperial\\n - istanbul\\n - italy\\n - march\\n - marseille\\n - mediterranean sea\\n - moscow\\n - most\\n - novosibirsk\\n - ottoman empire\\n - paris\\n - re\\n - roma\\n - roman\\n - roman empire\\n - rome\\n - russia\\n - russian empire\\n - saint petersburg\\n - samara\\n - sardinia\\n - sea\\n - switzerland\\n - topkapı palace\\n - turkey\\n - union\\n - united kingdom","target":"istanbul","rationale":"The rationale to choose \\"istanbul\\" as the answer is that:\\n\\n  Anthimus V of Constantinople was Ecumenical Patriarch from 1841 until his death in 1842.

In fact,he changed the ways his employees worked too.\\nHe let his workers take more responsibility so that they would be the ones worrying when things went wrong. He allowed them to set their own salaries,and he cut all the jobs he thought were unnecessary,like receptionists and secretaries. This saved money and brought more equality to the company. \\"Everyone at Semco,even top managers,meets guests in reception,does the photocopying,sends faxes,types letters and dials the phone.\\"\\nHe completely reorganized the office:instead of walls,they have plants at Semco,so bosses can't shut themselves away from everyone else. And the workers are free to decorate their workspace as they want. As for uniforms,some people wear suits and others wear T-shirts.\\nSemco has flexible  working hours:the employees decide when they need to arrive at work. Also,Semco lets its workers use the company's machines for their own projects,and makes them take holidays for at least thirty days a year.\\nIt sounds perfect,but does it work? The answer is in the numbers:in the last six years,Semco's revenues  have gone from $35 million to $212 million. The company has grown from eight hundred employees to 3,000. Why?\\nSemler says it's because of \\"peer pressure\\". Peer pressure makes employees work hard for everyone else. If someone isn't doing his job well,the other workers will not allow the situation to continue. In other words,Ricardo Semler treats his workers like adults rather than children, and expects them to act like responsible adults. And they do.\\nQuestion: Semler made a variety of changes in his company Except that  _  .\\nYes or no, is the answer \\"the employees can take only 30 days off for holiday every year.\\"?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The best place to look for the answer is in the first paragraph of the passage.

That means that while Italians may enjoy a glass of wine or beer, they don't usually get very drunk.\\nThat's not true anymore. The new study by the Italian National Health Institute found that 63 percent of Italians under age 18 get drunk on the weekends. Now, the city of Milan has created a law that will stop anyone under 16 from buying alcohol. Anyone who sells or gives alcohol to a person under 16 can be fined up to $700.\\nYoung people who feel that the new law is unfair should go to the US for some perspective. The US has the highest drinking age in the world: It's illegal for anyone under 21 to buy alcohol, and stores or restaurants that are caught selling alcohol to people under the legal age risk losing their licenses.\\nMany young Americans complain that the drinking laws are unfair: They are allowed to vote in elections and join the military at age 18, so why wait another three years just to buy a bottle of beer?\\nThese young people have found help in an unusual place. Last year, more than 100 presidents of US universities joined together to ask lawmakers to consider changing the drinking age. They argued that the law doesn't stop underage college kids from getting drunk - it just makes them want to drink more.\\nFor now, the law seems unlikely to change. But US teenagers who want alcohol can go north to Canada, where the drinking age is 18-19, or south to Mexico where the legal age is 18. Throughout much of Asia, Africa and Europe, the legal drinking age ranges 16-18.\\nIn plenty of places though, the official drinking age is ignored, and even young children can buy alcohol if they have the money to pay for it.\\nNo matter how old you are, you should always be responsible with alcohol.

Orr used his ice skating speed, scoring, and play-making abilities to revolutionize the position of defenceman. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 12 seasons, starting with 10 with the Boston Bruins followed by two with the Chicago Black Hawks. Orr remains the only defenceman to have won the league scoring title with two Art Ross Trophies.\\n\\nOrr signed with Chicago, but his injuries limited him to only 26 games over the next three seasons. He sat out the entire 1977-78 season. By 1978, Orr had undergone over a dozen knee surgeries, was having trouble walking and barely skated anymore. However, in the summer of 1978, he decided to make a comeback. He played six games of the 1978-79 season and came to the conclusion that he could no longer play and informed the Black Hawks that he was retiring. He started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford. He scored his last NHL goal and point against Detroit on October 28, 1978, at Detroit's Olympia Stadium.  Orr retired having scored 270 goals and 645 assists for 915 points in 657 games, adding 953 penalty minutes. At the time of his retirement, he was the leading defenceman in league history in goals, assists and points, tenth overall in assists and 19th in points. As of 2013, the only retired players in league history to have averaged more points per game than Orr are Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Mike Bossy, all of them forwards. \\"Losing Bobby\\", said Gordie Howe, \\"was the greatest blow the National Hockey League has ever suffered\\".  The Hockey Hall of Fame waived the normal three-year waiting period for induction into the Hall and he was enshrined at age 31 - the youngest player living at the time of his induction in history. Orr was the eighth player to have the three-year period waived, the next two being Mario Lemieux (1997) and Wayne Gretzky (1999), after which the Hall decided that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under \\"certain humanitarian circumstances\\".  His number 4 jersey was retired by the Bruins on January 9, 1979. At the ceremony, the crowd at Boston Garden would not stop applauding and as a result, most of the evening's program had to be scrapped at the last second due to the constant cheering. The crowd did not allow Orr to say his thank you speech until he put on a Bruins jersey. The day was proclaimed \\"Bobby Orr Day\\" in Boston and the event raised thousands of dollars for charity. He attended the Massachusetts Senate and House of Representatives and was given a five-minute standing ovation. Boston Celtics basketball superstar Larry Bird said in his pre-game inspiration that he always looked up at the rafters of the Garden at Orr's retired No. 4, instead of the retired numbers of Celtics stars such as Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, or John Havlicek.\\n\\nWhat did he do after retiring?","target":"He started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford.","rationale":"The context states that after retiring, Bobby Orr \\"started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford\\".\\nThus the answer is: He started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford."},{"source":"Here's a problem to solve: Which of the following best explains how stems transport water to other parts of the plant?\\n\\nAmong the 4 following options, which is the correct answer?\\n\\n- A: through a chemical called chlorophyll\\n \\n- B: by using photosynthesis\\n \\n- C: through a system of tubes\\n \\n- D: by converting water to food","target":"C","rationale":"In plants, the stem transports water and nutrients to other parts of the plant.

When about half of the liquid is gone, I then add the spice mix.Generally I get the heat just right with the chili/chipotle, but it's not quite salty enough and the cumin flavor doesn't seem to really impart itself enough to the point I'd like. Likewise, there's only a hint of the vinegar flavor, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when all of the other flavors are weak, but if the other flavors came more to life, I'd expect the vinegar flavor to be at least a bit bolder as well.Is there an ingredient I'm missing for this type of cooking that aids in making those flavors really stick to the beef? Or is this possibly just a case of \\"add more X\\"? Possibly a technique / timing issue? Alternatively, is there a spice out there that you could recommend as a stronger version of any of said ingredients?

Apple has cleverly taken advantage of the power of the letter \\"i\\" -- and many other brands are following suit. The BBC's iPlayer -- which allows Web users to watch TV programs on the Internet -- adopted the title in 2008. A lovely bear -- popular in the US and UK -- that plays music and video is called \\"iTeddy\\". A slimmed-down version of London's Independent newspaper was launched last week under the name \\"i\\".\\nIn general, single-letter prefixes have been popular since the 1990s, when terms such as e-mail and e-commerce first came into use.\\nMost \\"i\\" products are targeted at young people and considering the major readers of Independent's \\"i\\", it's no surprise that they've selected this fashionable name.\\nBut it's hard to see what's so special about the letter \\"i\\". Why not use \\"a\\", \\"b\\", or \\"c\\" instead? According to Tony Thorne, head of the Language Center at King's College, London, \\"i\\" works because its meaning has become ambiguous. When Apple uses \\"i\\", no one knows whether it means Internet, information, individual or interactive, Thorne told BBC Magazines. \\"Even when Apple created the iPod, it seems it didn't have one clear definition,\\" he says.\\n\\"However, thanks to Apple, the term is now associated with portability   .\\"adds Thorne.\\nClearly the letter \\"i\\" also agrees with the idea that the Western World is centered on the individual.

The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).","target":"Léonce Cohen","rationale":"The article mentions that Léonce Cohen won the Prix de Rome but didn't do much else in his career after winning.

The band's name comes from the Harry Dean Stanton character Travis Henderson from the film Paris, Texas. The band is widely claimed by the media as having paved the way for other bands such as Keane and Coldplay to go onto achieve worldwide success throughout the 2000s, particularly through the band's The Man Who (1999) album. The band released their debut album, Good Feeling (1997) to moderate success where it debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart and went onto achieve a silver certification from the BPI in January 2000.\\n\\nIn 2002, however, things came to a halt for Travis, with the band almost calling it quits, after drummer Neil Primrose went head-first into a shallow swimming pool while on tour in France, just after a concert at Eurockeennes festival. Breaking his neck, he almost died due to spinal damage. If not for his road crew, he also would have drowned. Despite the severity of the accident, Primrose has since made a full recovery.  With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into a cottage in Crear, Argyll and Bute, they set up a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003's 12 Memories. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody and political territory for the band. Although this seems to have alienated some fans, the album generally received very positive reviews (for example, \\"Then, of course, there's Travis and their album 12 Memories [Epic]. You just have to sit there and listen to it all the way through, and it will take you on a real journey. It's like an old album. It's like the Beatles' Revolver [1966]. Fran Healy's voice and lyrics are mesmerizing and beautiful\\"--Elton John), singles such as \\"Re-Offender\\" did very well on the UK chart, and the album itself reached No. 3. Yet it also saw them lose ground in the U.S., where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Fran Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the 12 memories being 12 reasons for him reaching his depressed state. At the time this wasn't mentioned, but the revelation that Healy was depressed ties in with the band's decision to take longer writing and releasing their next work.  In 2004, Travis embarked on a highly successful tour of Canada, the US, and Europe (supported by Keane in the UK), and on November 2004, the band released a successful compilation of their singles, Singles, as well as the new tracks, \\"Walking in the Sun\\" and \\"The Distance\\" (written by Dougie Payne). This was followed by a series of small, intimate gigs at UK venues such as Liverpool's Cavern Club, London's Mean Fiddler, and Glasgow's Barrowlands. While on tour, the band also made a series of impromptu acoustic \\"busks\\", raising money for the charity The Big Issue. In addition to other performances, they also headlined the 2005 Isle of Wight Festival and T in the Park.  On 2 July 2005, Travis performed at Live 8's London concert, and four days later, at the Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push concert. Travis also participated in Band Aid 20's re-recording of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\"--Healy and friend Nigel Godrich playing leading roles in its organisation. Healy is a part of the Make Poverty History movement, having recently made two trips to Sudan with the Save the Children organisation.

This effect appears to be specific for the alpha 1-receptor. To determine the effect of this drug on vascular permeability to serum proteins and inflammatory cells, leakage of serum proteins into the central nervous system (CNS) was measured with [125I]albumin, and quantitation of cellular inflammation was determined by an estimation of total DNA. The results show that in both actively induced and passively transferred models of the disease, treatment with prazosin significantly suppresses leakage of serum proteins into the CNS but does not significantly suppress the increase of DNA. The results of the [125I]albumin studies additionally support the conclusion that the extent of vascular permeability to serum proteins in the spinal cord is a significant correlate of clinical disease. The results of the DNA estimation were at variance with the histologic evidence of cellular infiltration. We conclude that treatment with prazosin has a significant effect on the development of vascular edema in EAE. These results additionally validate a role for the adrenergic receptor in the development of EAE, and support the hypothesis that the primary site of action of prazosin is on the vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptor.","target":"Animal","rationale":"The abstract discusses the use of prazosin to treat symptoms of autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats.

Primarily consisting of lead vocalists Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless, and Gioia Bruno, the group achieved much of their success between 1984 and 1993, becoming the first group to have four top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from its debut album, including the 1988 #1 hit \\"Seasons Change\\". In March 2015, Billboard magazine named the group the eighth most-successful girl group of all-time. The group was popular in dance clubs, mainstream Top 40 and adult contemporary charts in the United States.\\n\\nDuring the recording of the group's first studio album Exposure, the personnel of the group changed. Reports vary based on the source. According to People magazine, one of the original singers quit while two of the girls were fired midway through the recording of the first album, but according to Billboard, all three were fired. Arista records felt that the three original singers lacked star potential. Martinee states that he made the decision himself to replace the three girls, while Miller maintains it was all their choice, and Jurado confirms that Lorenzo wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, Casanas pursued a solo career and Lorenzo pursued other ambitions; they were replaced by Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno. Miller began a solo career; she was replaced by Ann Curless.  Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with the Vendetta Records releases \\"I Wanna Know\\" in 1988, and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love\\" in 1990, while Laurie Miller released the 12\\" single \\"Parallels\\" on Atlantic Records and a second single \\"Love is a Natural Magical Thing\\" on Meet Me In Miami Records. Laurie evolved into a headline performer frequently showcasing her talents on cruises with a more intimate jazz style, and formed her own entertainment company called Xica productions.  Casanas later resurfaced as a solo artist (Sandee) and released a solo album, Only Time Will Tell, which garnered the club hits \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\", and the Clivilles & Cole-produced bassline-heavy hit \\"Notice Me\\". She continued to tour actively in dance clubs and freestyle shows, until her death on December 15, 2008, of a seizure at the age of 46. All three original members: Casanas, Lorenzo and Miller later contributed vocals on songs on the Miami group Will to Power's eponymous 1988 debut album. Gioia Bruno also provided lead vocals on Will to Power's 2004 album, Spirit Warrior. Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\\n\\nDid they have any hit singles alone?","target":"Notice Me\\".","rationale":"The text mentions that the group Expose consisted of three members: Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless and Gioia Bruno. Later in the paragraph it mentions that one member (Casanas) released a solo album called Only Time Will Tell which has three club hits by itself namely \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\" and \\"Notice Me\\".\\nSo based on this information we can infer that after Casanas left Expose she had 3 hit singles alone.

The band has released eight studio albums, out of which the first three were recorded under R.E.X. Records with their original vocalist Darren Johnson as a more thrash metal and death metal oriented band. The band evolved into a groove metal/metalcore style beginning with \\"Reborn\\" (1997) under Solid State Records with the original guitarist Bruce Fitzhugh on vocals. In 2003, the group split up, due to other projects and later their label, Solid State, released their best-of album, \\"In Memoriam\\" (2005). In 2008, Living Sacrifice reformed and released a two-song digital only single called \\"Death Machine\\". They then began working on \\"The Infinite Order\\" which was released on January 26, 2010. Lance Garvin and Bruce Fitzhugh are the two remaining original members.\\n\\n- Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.\\n\\n- Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.\\n\\n- Solid State Records is a Christian record label, an imprint of Tooth & Nail Records. Unlike Tooth & Nail, Solid State signs hardcore punk and heavy metal bands. Like Tooth & Nail, Solid State is primarily a Christian label. However, they have signed several bands with Christian members that don't label themselves as Christian bands, including Stretch Arm Strong, Gwen Stacy, He Is Legend, the Famine, Training for Utopia, and the Agony Scene. The label is best known for Norma Jean, Beloved, Zao and Stretch Arm Strong.\\n\\n- The Infinite Order is the seventh studio album from Christian metal band Living Sacrifice released January 26, 2010. The album, produced by Jeremiah Scott and mixed by Andy Sneap marks a return for the band since their prior album in 2002. Because the manufacturer used the wrong master, the first pressing has an additional song \\"Of My Flesh, Of My Heart\\" on track 12 that was intended to be a bonus track on a possible European release. Future pressings will have the intended 11 tracks. They have since made a deluxe edition of the album available only through iTunes. The deluxe edition features new artwork, one bonus studio track, two live bonus tracks, and the \\"In Finite\\" Live DVD. Music videos were made for the songs \\"Rules of Engagement\\" and \\"Overkill Exposure\\". \\"Love Forgives\\" is inspired by the book of 1 Corinthians 13.\\n\\n- Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.\\n\\n- Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.\\n\\n- Bruce Fitzhugh is the second and best known lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and founding member of Arkansas's Christian metal band Living Sacrifice.

A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, \\"Anywhere but Home\\", which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, the band released their second studio album, \\"The Open Door\\", which sold more than five million copies.\\n\\n- We Are the Fallen is an American-Irish gothic metal band consisting of former \\"American Idol\\" contestant Carly Smithson, Marty O'Brien and former Evanescence members Ben Moody, John LeCompt, and Rocky Gray. The band's name is an allusion to Evanescence's 2003 album, \\"Fallen\\", which has resulted in criticism for their similar style to Evanescence. In a \\"Los Angeles Times\\" interview, co-founder of Evanescence, Ben Moody, said that We Are the Fallen differs from Evanescence in that \\"everyone is equal\\" and that it has \\"more energy than Evanescence could ever muster.\\" He also stated, \\"We cannot try to be who we are. If there is some similarity in sound, it's because that genre was created by us.\\"\\n\\n- William Rocky Gray (born July 2, 1974) is a drummer and guitarist who has been part of the Arkansas metal scene since the early 1990s. He has an extensive career as a musician and is best known as the lead guitarist for Living Sacrifice and Solus Deus, and the drummer for We Are the Fallen. He also plays drums for Soul Embraced, Mourningside, and Machina and he is the former drummer for Evanescence. Gray is also currently doing a solo album titled \\"Accursed\\".\\n\\n- R.E.X. Records was an independent record label founded by Doug Mann and Gavin Morkel, which operated from 1987 until running into financial difficulty in 1995. Operations were based in Chicago until 1990 when the company moved to Nashville. The label was artistic in nature, and though they were especially active in the Christian metal genre some acts (such as Circle of Dust) were also marketed to mainstream audiences. Sublabels included Storyville Records and Street Level Records, founded by Randy Stonehill.\\n\\n- Groove metal (also known as post-thrash or neo-thrash) is a subgenre of heavy metal music. It is often used to describe Pantera, Exhorder and Machine Head. At its core, groove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of thrash metal and plays them at mid-tempo, with most bands making only occasional forays into fast tempo.\\n\\n\\n\\n'the hammering process' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'record label'?\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1995\\n - album\\n - heavy metal music\\n - independent record label\\n - record\\n - rock music\\n - solid state records\\n - street level records\\n - studio album\\n - united kingdom\\n - up records","target":"solid state records","rationale":"The album \\"The Hammering Process\\" was recorded by Living Sacrifice, a Christian metal band. From the information provided in this question we can conclude that their music is categorized as heavy metal because it has distorted and low-tuned guitars with loud drumming. According to the given text about R.E.X Records (the label for which they originally recorded) we also know that Living Sacrifice's first three albums were more thrash/death metal oriented before evolving into groove/metalcore style beginning with Reborn (1997).\\nA record label or recording company works on behalf of its artists to promote and market the music he makes by collaborating with musicians from other fields like advertising, PR etc., so as to make his songs known worldwide.

According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak. Considered in a bilingual point of view, British English was the dominant language linked to prestige and language purism . The belief in the authority or say in the superior of British English, has remained to the twentieth century, especially in the former British Empire or in the fields of British influence.\\nThus, it is reported that in prefix = st1 /China, teachers and school textbooks refer to and recommend Received Pronunciation as the model, as well as standard British sentence structures, spelling and words. British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English. Report can also be found that inCairosome university students received lower grades if they used American spellings instead of British English. In Europe, we find teachers, British people as well as natives of the country in which they work, who follow the British English standard, and laugh at the American English.\\nHowever, the above attitudes are nothing but the last influence of a long-gone period of British supermacy . The beginning of a clear lead of American English can be traced to the decades after World War II. This coincides with the simultaneous  rise of the US as a military and technological power and the decline of the British Empire, which drove many to American English. And from then on, American English has continuously sent its influence to every corner of the planet.\\nQuestion: The main idea of the passage is_.\\nOptions: A: there are big differences between American English and British English\\nB: how American English developed into standard English in the end\\nC: people began to admit American English as standard as British English\\nD: American English is having advantage over British English.","target":"D","rationale":"In the article, it is written that even though American English was considered non-standard in the 1780s, people have been accepting it as standard since World War II.

In conclusion, option D is correct because based on this context “D: American English is having advantage over British English” shows how America started becoming dominant globally after World War II with their language (American English) being accepted worldwide thus making its advantages over other languages including Britain's own language(British English)."},{"source":"Read the article and select the best answer.\\nArticle: Some time ago I received a gift from both of my children.

During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.

What if we are the children of unknown fathers? For answers please consult Frankenstein. For self-important, barely comprehensible drivel please consult Prometheus.Great direction can save poor scripts. A director seduced by CGI shooting an incredibly weak screenplay by an overrated pair of writers will not. How on Earth Lindelof and Spaihts got the gig is beyond me. There are strong writers in Hollywood and others trying to get a break that could have done a better job, a MUCH better job.Ridley Scott, like Spielberg, has forgotten what making a raw, honest movie is like and is far too distracted with how excessive CGI can make it look pretty. Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined. It could have been so much better. But Scott needs to be brought back down to Earth (pun intended) and he should have chosen his writing team more wisely. Still, it was nice to hear Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme, albeit briefly.\\nquestion: Is this storyline interesting or strong?","target":"important","rationale":"The question asks whether the storyline is interesting or strong.

Randomly selected records of patients with a diagnosis of SpA and at least one visit to a rheumatology unit within the previous 2\\\\xa0years were audited. The rates of rheumatology visits and of referrals to other medical specialties were estimated-total and between centres-in the study period. Multilevel regression was used to analyse factors associated with variability and to adjust for clinical and patient characteristics.', \\"1168 patients' records (45 centres) were reviewed, mainly ankylosing spondylitis (55.2\\\\xa0%) and psoriatic arthritis (22.2\\\\xa0%). The patients had incurred in 5908 visits to rheumatology clinics (rate 254 per 100 patient-years), 4307 visits to other medical specialties (19.6\\\\xa0% were referrals from rheumatology), and 775 visits to specialised nurse clinics. An adjusted variability in frequenting rheumatology clinics of 15.7\\\\xa0% between centres was observed. This was partially explained by the number of faculties and trainees. The adjusted intercentre variability for referrals to other specialties was 12.3\\\\xa0%, and it was associated with urban settings, number of procedures, and existence of SpA dedicated clinics; the probability of a patient with SpA of being referred to other specialist may increase up to 25\\\\xa0% depending on the treating centre.","target":"Do centre characteristics determine ambulatory care and referrals in patients with spondyloarthritis?","rationale":"The question should be answerable based on the information in the given paragraph.

In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4 -/mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4 -/mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4 -/mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4's impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis. Given the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.","target":"Mucin 4 Protects Female Mice from Coronavirus Pathogenesis","rationale":"The title should reflect the main findings, which are that Muc4 expression protects female mice from coronavirus pathogenesis.

He was known for his cartoons in the British press, and for his lifelong work to inform the general public about good buildings and architectural heritage. \\nThe only child of a prosperous family, Lancaster was educated at Charterhouse School and Lincoln College, Oxford, at both of which he was an undistinguished scholar. From an early age he was determined to be a professional artist and designer, and studied at leading art colleges in Oxford and London. While working as a contributor to The Architectural Review in the mid-1930s, Lancaster published the first of a series of books on architecture, aiming to simultaneously amuse the general reader and demystify the subject. Several of the terms he coined as labels for architectural styles have gained common usage, including \\"Pont Street Dutch\\" and \\"Stockbrokers' Tudor\\", and his books have continued to be regarded as important works of reference on the subject.\\nIn 1938 Lancaster was invited to contribute topical cartoons to The Daily Express. He introduced the single column-width cartoon popular in the French press but not until then seen in British papers. Between 1939 and his retirement in 1981 he drew about 10,000 of these \\"pocket cartoons\\", which made him a nationally known figure. He developed a cast of regular characters, led by his best-known creation, Maudie Littlehampton, through whom he expressed his views on the fashions, fads and political events of the day.\\nFrom his youth, Lancaster wanted to design for the theatre, and in 1951 he was commissioned to create costumes and scenery for a new ballet, Pineapple Poll. Between then and the early 1970s he designed new productions for the Royal Ballet, Glyndebourne, D'Oyly Carte, the Old Vic and the West End.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk.
