Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio.\\nThroughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”.\\nConstraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...\\nThe writer believes that\\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\\n\\nA. researching is good\\n\\nB. not enough information\\n\\nC.

So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force.

The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\" \\nQuestion: Possum Kingdom Lake is in which Texas county?\\n\\nI am grading my students' exercises.

Applying mixup in training provides an effective mechanism to improve generalization performance and model robustness against adversarial perturbations, which introduces the globally linear behavior in-between training examples. However, in previous work, the mixup-trained models only passively defend adversarial attacks in inference by directly classifying the inputs, where the induced global linearity is not well exploited. Namely, since the locality of the adversarial perturbations, it would be more efficient to actively break the locality via the globality of the model predictions. Inspired by simple geometric intuition, we develop an inference principle, named mixup inference (MI), for mixup-trained models. MI mixups the input with other random clean samples, which can shrink and transfer the equivalent perturbation if the input is adversarial. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that MI can further improve the adversarial robustness for the models trained by mixup and its variants.","target":"We exploit the global linearity of the mixup-trained models in inference to break the locality of the adversarial perturbations","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nWe exploit the global linearity of the mixup-trained models in inference to break the locality of the adversarial perturbations."},{"source":"No one understands that phrase structure rules explain the little understood phenomenon of the infinite length of sentences.\\n\\nHow would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?\\nOPTIONS:\\n- unacceptable\\n- acceptable","target":"acceptable","rationale":"Yes, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.

The first choice (a) is unrelated to the story, as it involves saving up money, which does not connect with anything that was mentioned in the story. The second choice (b) may be a continuation of the story in which Todd pulls over Donna for getting jump starts from him. However, this does not seem likely since once he installed his new battery, he had no more trouble starting his truck. This suggests that Todd was able to stop giving Donna jump starts after installing his new battery and would not have pulled her over for continuing to do so afterwards. Therefore, we can eliminate option b from our choices as it makes little sense to stop giving someone help and then pull them over moments later when they continue asking for such help themselves. The third choice (c) is a good match because it links back with the title of the task where Todd was having trouble starting his truck and needed many jumps starts before going out to buy a new battery as described in this sequence of events: \\"He had been getting jump starts.\\" -> \\"He went to the store and bought a car battery.\\" -> \\"...had no more trouble.\\" -> \\"Todd's truck had been having trouble starting\\"."},{"source":"For a month, anything I consumed would result in me rushing to the wash room and throwing up.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...","target":"Heseltine","rationale":"The answer is in the following sentence.\\nHeseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea."},{"source":"Where can meat last a long time?\\n\\n[Options]\\n- backery\\n- ham sandwich\\n- fridge\\n- butcher shop\\n- freezer","target":"freezer","rationale":"A freezer is used to store meat for long time.

They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994.\\nAfter signing to EMI in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single \\"Creep\\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums in popular music. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), recorded simultaneously, marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Kid A divided listeners but was named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and The Times.\\nHail to the Thief (2003) mixed rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.

She was also a Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee until February 28, 2016, when she resigned to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Elected in 2012, she is the first Samoan American and the first Hindu member of the United States Congress. She served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard in a combat zone in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009.\\n\\nGabbard opposes the US removing Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad from power. She has cited US \\"regime-change\\" involvement in Syria as a source of the Syrian refugee crisis.  In 2013 Gabbard opposed the Obama administration's proposed military strikes in Syria, arguing that intervention in Syria would go against America's national security, international credibility, economic interest, and moral center. She later introduced legislation to block U.S. military action against the Assad regime. She has described US involvement in the Syrian Civil War as \\"our counterproductive regime-change war\\", and said that it is this \\"regime-change war that is causing people to flee their country\\".  Gabbard was one of three members of Congress to vote against House resolution 121, which condemned the government of Syria and \\"other parties to the conflict\\" for war crimes and crimes against humanity,\\" saying that though Assad is a \\"brutal dictator,\\" the resolution was \\"a War Bill--a thinly veiled attempt to use the rationale of 'humanitarianism' as a justification for overthrowing the Syrian government\\". She explained that the resolution \\"urges the administration to create 'additional mechanisms for the protection of civilians', which is coded language for the creation of a so-called no-fly/safe zone.\\" Gabbard has rejected suggestions for the creation of a no-fly zone in Syria, stating that it would cost \\"billions of dollars, require tens of thousands of ground troops and a massive U.S. air presence, and it won't work\\", and that such a move would risk confrontation with Russia.  In November 2016 she met with United States president-elect Donald Trump to enlist his support to stop the United States' alleged \\"illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government\\".  In January 2017, Gabbard made a secret \\"fact-finding\\" mission to Damascus and met with diverse civil society groups as well as government officials, including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In April 2017, after the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack killed at least 74 civilians and injured hundreds more, Gabbard called for a UN investigation into the attack and the prosecution of Bashar al-Assad in the International Criminal Court if he is found to be responsible. After President Trump ordered the 2017 Shayrat missile strike targeting the Syrian airfield believed to be the source of the attack, Gabbard called the strike reckless and expressed skepticism that Assad was responsible for the attack, which led to sharp criticism from former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean as well as Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden. Gabbard has not revised her position since the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) reported in June 2017 that sarin gas had been used in the attack.\\n\\nDid she speak out against the Obama administration?","target":"She later introduced legislation to block U.S. military action against the Assad regime.","rationale":"The context states that she opposed the Obama administration's proposed military strikes in Syria.

The two fight, and the caveman wins, stabbing the alien to death. However, fans of the show will recognize the black oil as it bleeds from the alien's wounds and soaks into the Neanderthal. After a fade to modern-day small-town Texas, a little boy (Lucas Black) falls down a hole in his back yard, and finds a human skull. As he picks it up, black oil seeps out from the ground beneath his feet, and black slivers move up his legs until they reach his head - his eyes go black. Shortly afterward, a team of firemen descend to rescue him. They are presumably lost to the same fate as the boy.In the summer of 1998, at the end of the show's fifth season, the X-Files were shut down, and Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were assigned to other projects.

While Michaud remains to disarm the bomb, Mulder and Scully are able to evacuate the building and prevent hundreds of casualties before it explodes.

His father, Lester, was a dispatcher for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad. Massillon was a shipping and steel town obsessed with its high school and professional football teams, both called the Tigers. Massillon's main rival at both levels was nearby Canton, at the time a bigger and richer town.\\nContext: Brown returned to Massillon in 1932, when he was 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2-6-2 record. Brown's strategy was to build up a disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed to sit on the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.  In his first season at Massillon, Brown's team posted a 5-4-1 record, better than the previous year but far from Brown's exacting standards. The Tigers improved again in 1933, ending with an 8-2 record but losing to their chief rivals, the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs. In 1934, Massillon won all of its games until a 21-6 defeat to Canton in the final game of the season. As the pressure on Brown grew to turn the tables on Canton, Massillon finally accomplished the feat the following year in an undefeated season, the first of several with Brown at the helm.  By then, Brown had put his system into place: a strict, systematic approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network that drew promising young players from Massillon's junior high school football program. He paid no attention to race, and brought several African-American players onto the team at a time when many northern schools excluded them.  In the ensuing five seasons, Massillon lost only one game, a 7-0 defeat at New Castle, Pennsylvania in 1937 after several players came down with the flu. As the Tigers' prestige grew, Brown in 1936 convinced the school to build a new stadium almost triple the size of the existing 7,000-seat facility. The stadium was finished in 1939, and is now named after Brown. The pinnacle of Brown's career at Massillon was a victory in the 1940 season against Toledo's Waite High School. The Tigers and Waite both went undefeated in the 1939 season, and both claimed the state championship. The teams decided to settle the score the following year, and Brown's team won 28-0. The Massillon 1940 squad is still regarded by historians as one of the best in the history of state high school football.  During his nine years at Massillon, Brown invented the playbook, a detailed listing of formations and set plays, and tested his players on their knowledge of it. He also originated the practice of sending in plays to his quarterback from the sideline using hand signals. His overall record at the school was 80-8-2, including a 35-game winning streak. Between 1935 and 1940, the team won the state football championship six times and won the High School Football National Championship four times, outscoring opponents by 2,393 points to 168 over that span. After the early losses to Canton, the Tigers beat the Bulldogs six straight times.\\nQuestion: Did they ever regain their success.

It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament.

Its history goes back to 1270 when a dam was constructed in the Rotte river by people settled around it for safety. In 1340 Rotterdam was granted city rights by the Count of Holland and slowly grew into a major logistic and economic centre. Nowadays it is home to Europe's largest port and has a population of 633,471 (city proper), ranking second in the Netherlands. The Greater Rijnmond area is home to approximately 1.4 million people and the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Area makes for the 168th most populous urban area in the world.

The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite.\\n\\n- Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people.

The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining.

Passage:After the fall of the Lovell family following their support of the Lancastrian cause during the Wars of the Roses, the castle was confiscated in 1461 and passed through several owners until bought by Sir Thomas Arundell of Lanherne in 1544. The Arundells were an ancient and prominent Cornish family, the principal branches of which were seated at the manors of Lanherne, Trerice, Tolverne and Menadarva in Cornwall. The family held several estates in Wiltshire. The castle was confiscated when Sir Thomas — a staunch Roman Catholic — was executed for treason in 1552, but in 1570 was bought back by his son, Sir Matthew Arundell, later a Sheriff and Custos Rotulorum of Dorset. The Arundells, led by Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, subsequently became known as some of the most active of the Catholic landowners in England at the time of the Reformation; thus they were naturally Royalists in the English Civil War. During that conflict, Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour, was away from home on the King's business and had asked his wife, Lady Blanche Arundell, aged 61, to defend the castle with a garrison of 25 trained fighting men. On 2 May 1643 Sir Edward Hungerford, with 1,300 men of the Parliamentarian Army, demanded admittance to search for Royalists. He was refused and laid siege, setting about the walls with guns and mines. After five days the castle was threatened with complete destruction. Lady Arundell agreed to surrender, and the castle was placed under the command of Colonel Edmund Ludlow. Lord Arundell had died of his wounds after the Battle of Stratton, and his son, Henry 3rd Lord Arundell, next laid siege to his own castle, blew up much of it and obliged the Parliamentary garrison to surrender in March 1644.","target":"The castle was confiscated when Sir Thomas — a staunch Roman Catholic — was executed for treason in 1552, but in 1570 was bought back by his son, Sir Matthew Arundell, later a Sheriff and Custos Rotulorum of Dorset","rationale":"The second sentence in the paragraph provides information about the age of Sir Matthew Arundell at the time of his father's execution.

The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass. Stated differently, the RDA for copper in normal healthy adults is quoted as 0.97 mg/day and as 3.0 mg/day. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase. Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin, which carries the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.\\nWhat is the answer to this question: What is copper bound with when it is sent to the liver?","target":"albumin","rationale":"The context states that \\"\\" Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin.\\"\\".\\nThus, based on this information we can infer that copper is sent to the liver along with albumin."},{"source":"The farther the sound waves travel away from the source, the more spread out their energy becomes.\\n\\nHaving read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are they spread out less or they spread out more ):\\n\\n\\nIf Milo is listening to the radio and he moves to the far end of the room, what happens to the sound waves entering his ear they spread out less or they spread out more?","target":"they spread out more","rationale":"Sound waves are mechanical vibrations that propagate in the form of longitudinal waves.

The offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. All prokaryotes and some eukaryotes reproduce this way. There are several different methods of asexual reproduction. They include binary fission, fragmentation, and budding. Binary fission occurs when a parent cell simply splits into two daughter cells. This method is described in detail in the lesson \\"Cell Division.\\" Bacteria reproduce this way. You can see a bacterial cell reproducing by binary fission in Figure 5.9. Fragmentation occurs when a piece breaks off from a parent organism. Then the piece develops into a new organism. Sea stars, like the one in Figure 5.10, can reproduce this way. In fact, a new sea star can form from a single arm. Budding occurs when a parent cell forms a bubble-like bud. The bud stays attached to the parent while it grows and develops. It breaks away from the parent only after it is fully formed. Yeasts can reproduce this way. You can see two yeast cells budding in Figure 5.11. Sexual reproduction is more complicated. It involves two parents. Special cells called gametes are produced by the parents. A gamete produced by a female parent is generally called an egg. A gamete produced by a male parent is usually called a sperm. An offspring forms when two gametes unite. The union of the two gametes is called fertilization. You can see a human sperm and egg uniting in Figure 5.12. The initial cell that forms when two gametes unite is called a zygote. In species with sexual reproduction, each cell of the body has two copies of each chromosome. For example, human beings have 23 different chromosomes. Each body cell contains two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes. You can see the 23 pairs of human chromosomes in Figure 5.13. The number of different types of chromosomes is called the haploid number. In humans, the haploid number is 23. The number of chromosomes in normal body cells is called the diploid number. The diploid number is twice the haploid number. In humans, the diploid number is two times 23, or 46. The two members of a given pair of chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. We get one of each homologous pair, or 23 chromosomes, from our father. We get the other one of each pair, or 23 chromosomes, from our mother. A gamete must have the haploid number of chromosomes. That way, when two gametes unite, the zygote will have the diploid number. How are haploid cells produced? The answer is meiosis. Meiosis is a special type of cell division. It produces haploid daughter cells. It occurs when an organism makes gametes. Meiosis is basically mitosis times two. The original diploid cell divides twice. The first time is called meiosis I. The second time is called meiosis II. However, the DNA replicates only once. It replicates before meiosis I but not before meiosis II. This results in four haploid daughter cells. Meiosis I and meiosis II occurs in the same four phases as mitosis. The phases are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. However, meiosis I has an important difference. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and then separate. As a result, each daughter cell has only one chromosome from each homologous pair. Figure 5.14 is a simple model of meiosis. It shows both meiosis I and II. You can read more about the stages below. You can also learn more about them by watching this video: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: After DNA replicates during interphase, the nucleus of the cell undergoes the four phases of meiosis I: 1. Prophase I: Chromosomes form, and the nuclear membrane breaks down. Centrioles move to opposite poles of the cell. Spindle fibers form between the centrioles. Heres whats special about meiosis: Homologous chromosomes pair up! You can see this in Figure below. 2. Metaphase I: Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of the paired homologous chromosomes.

The story does not explicitly address cost, except to call text messaging “a scalable and affordable approach.” For many (or most) patients, the cost of receiving four text messages a week would likely be negligible — covered by an individual’s phone plan or by nominal text rates. However, not everyone owns a mobile phone, a fact that makes access (and cost) a more significant issue. However, the story does deliver on this point. The story discusses both the number of U.S. adults who own mobile phones (90 percent) and the fact that text messages are more accessible than other forms of mobile health communication (such as apps, which require patients to own smartphones or other smart devices). So, while we’d prefer a more in-depth discussion here, we’ll award a Satisfactory rating for the story’s nod in this direction. The story addresses the range of benefits reported in the study, such as reduced cholesterol and blood pressure, but doesn’t quantify that information or offer readers any context. For example, while the story says “patients who had received the text messages had reduced their cholesterol,” the JAMA paper reports that patients who received the text messages had a “mean difference [of] −5 mg/dL” in “LDL-C.” In other words, the information in the paper, while quantified, probably isn’t very useful to many readers outside the health industry. Is “a mean difference of −5 mg/dL in LDL-C” good? Bad? Irrelevant? This is where reporters have an opportunity to shine. If a news story can take those numbers and translate them into language that is accessible to non-experts, it provides a very real service. It would have been great to see that here. As long as people aren’t driving and checking their cell phones, there don’t appear to be any harms associated with receiving well-meaning text messages four times a week, so we’ll mark this one “not applicable.” This is a strong suit. The story not only offers a concise, but good, summary of the study — but it also goes out of its way to address the study’s limitations. For example, the study notes that the study “can’t tell us whether text messaging could eventually lead to fewer subsequent heart attacks among the patients receiving those messages or whether the positive health outcomes would continue past the six-month study window.” Good points, and we’re glad the story includes them. No disease mongering here. The story includes input from an outside expert who was not involved with the research. The story clearly meets our bar here, although it would have been stronger if it had reached out to at least one more independent source — preferably one who hadn’t written an editorial that ran in conjunction with the paper in JAMA. Yes, the editorial was independent and provides some insightful commentary. But it also means we already knew where this source stood on the issue. Finding another reputable expert, who hadn’t already weighed in publicly on the work, would have been great. The focus of the story is not so much on how the text message intervention directly reduced heart disease risk, but on the extent to which it resulted in patients taking steps to reduce their own risk — such as by exercising more, smoking less, making dietary changes, or taking prescription drugs on a regular basis. The story does discuss other “mobile health interventions,” such as smartphone apps — but notes that there don’t appear to be many mobile health projects that rely simply on text messages. The story also looks at how the text messages helped patients pursue lifestyle changes — like exercising more and smoking less — that reduced their risk. It was fairly clear from the story that this was a clinical trial, and that this particular service doesn’t seem to be available to offer customized, encouraging text messages for heart disease patients. From the start, the story frames this research in the context of the much larger “mobile health” field. For example, the story notes that “While there are more than 100,000 health-related apps on the market, the evidence to date is lacking as to whether many of those apps are safe or effective.” Since the story includes quotes from an interview, we can be fairly certain it went beyond the related JAMA news release.

If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red.

The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost. The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing food for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it. Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host. Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium).

In one account, Tweedy recalled:\\nAround this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore.\\nTweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.

Kennedy himself was said to have given copies of the albums as Christmas gifts, and once greeted a Democratic National Committee group by saying, \\"Vaughn Meader was busy tonight, so I came myself.\\" According to UPI reporter Merriman Smith, during a Cabinet meeting Kennedy played the entire record for everyone. At one press conference, Kennedy was asked if the album had produced \\"annoyment (sic) or enjoyment.\\" He jokingly responded, \\"I listened to Mr. Meader's record and, frankly, I thought it sounded more like Teddy than it did me.

Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. \\n\\n- Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.\\n\\n- The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.\\n\\n- The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chuichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it \\"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\\"\\n\\n- Frank Jack Fletcher (April 29, 1885  April 25, 1973) was an admiral in the United States Navy during World War II. Fletcher was the operational commander at the pivotal Battles of Coral Sea and of Midway. As a lieutenant, Fletcher was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in battle at Veracruz. He was the nephew of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, who was also awarded the Medal of Honor for actions at Veracruz.\\n\\n- A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.\\n\\n- World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\n- Yamamoto held several important posts in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and undertook many of its changes and reorganizations, especially its development of naval aviation. He was the commander-in-chief during the decisive early years of the Pacific War and so was responsible for major battles such as Pearl Harbor and Midway. He died when American codebreakers identified his flight plans and his plane was shot down. His death was a major blow to Japanese military morale during World War II.\\n\\n- Sir John Desmond Patrick Keegan (15 May 1934  2 August 2012) was a British military historian, lecturer, writer and journalist. He was the author of many published works on the nature of combat between the 14th and 21st centuries concerning land, air, maritime, and intelligence warfare, as well as the psychology of battle.\\n\\n- The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyjitai: Shinjitai: \\"\\" or \\"Nippon Kaigun\\", \\"Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire\\") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and the Ministry of the Navy, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN.\\n\\n- The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.\\n\\n- Pearl Harbor is a lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941 was the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II.\\n\\n- John Charles Waldron ( August 24 , 1900 -- June 4 , 1942 ) was a United States Navy aviator who led a squadron of torpedo bombers in World War II. He and most of his squadron perished in the Battle of Midway .\\n\\n- The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought during 48 May 1942, was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other, as well as the first in which neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other.\\n\\n- During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.\\n\\n- The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .\\n\\n- The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.\\n\\n- A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\".\\n\\n- Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.\\n\\n- Midway Atoll (also called Midway Island and Midway Islands; Hawaiian: \\"Pihemanu Kauihelani\\") is a atoll in the North Pacific Ocean at . As its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia. Midway Atoll is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Midway continues to be the only island in the Hawaiian archipelago that is not part of the state of Hawaii. Unlike the other Hawaiian islands, Midway observes Samoa Time (i.e., eleven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time), which is one hour behind the time in the state of Hawaii. For statistical purposes, Midway is grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing of land and water (mostly water) in the surrounding area, is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument.\\n\\n- The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and Operation Z during planning, was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941.

He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history.\\n\\nLeinart was given the starting quarterback job at the start of the 2007 season. However, in the third game of the season, against the Baltimore Ravens, Warner came off the bench to relieve an ineffective Leinart during the 4th quarter with the Ravens leading 23-6 at the beginning of the period. Warner led a furious comeback, as he completed 15 of 20 passes for 258 yards and 2 touchdowns. This brought Arizona to a tie game (23-23), though Arizona would go on to lose the game 26-23 after Baltimore kicked a last-second field goal.  On September 30, 2007, during the week four game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Warner relieved Leinart again, following another ineffective start. Warner finished with 14 completed of 21 attempts for 132 yards with one touchdown pass and no interceptions, while Leinart re-entered the game in the 4th quarter and led the Cardinals to their final touchdown. After Leinart was placed on injured reserve, Warner was named starter for the remainder of the 2007 season.  Warner passed for a career-high 484 yards against the 49ers in a 37-31 loss on November 25, but had a fumble in the end zone in overtime that was recovered by Tully Banta-Cain, and the Cardinals lost. However, the following week Warner improved; and the Cardinals earned a victory over the Browns that brought the Cardinals to 6-6 and kept them in the chase for the NFC Wild Card playoff spot. Warner finished the 2007 season with 27 passing touchdowns, just one shy of the Cardinals franchise record.

Price wrote in his SPR report \\"William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates for those of a sitter ... It implies that the medium brings to the sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent purposes.\\"  Price secretly marked Hope's photographic plates, and provided him with a packet of additional plates that had been covertly etched with the brand image of the Imperial Dry Plate Co.

The presence of vascular risk factors was related to incident possible and probable AD.   \\n RESULTS Four risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and current smoking) were associated with a higher risk of AD (p < 0.10) when analyzed individually. The risk of AD increased with the number of risk factors (diabetes + hypertension + heart disease + current smoking). The adjusted hazards ratio of probable AD for the presence of three or more risk factors was 3.4 (95% CI: 1.8, 6.3; p for trend < 0.0001) compared with no risk factors. Diabetes and current smoking were the strongest risk factors in isolation or in clusters, but hypertension and heart disease were also related to a higher risk of AD when clustered with diabetes, smoking, or each other.   \\n CONCLUSIONS The risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) increased with the number of vascular risk factors.

Passage 1:Dodds gained a reputation as a top young drummer in New Orleans. In 1918, Dodds left Sonny Celestin's outfit to play in Fate Marable's riverboat band. A young Louis Armstrong also joined the band, and the two of them were on the boats for three years (from 1918 to 1921). The band played on four different boats, and usually left New Orleans in May and travel to St. Louis, though they also sometimes traveled further north. They played jazz, popular, and classical music while on the boats. Dodds and Armstrong left Fate Marable's band in 1921 due to a disagreement about musical style, and Dodds soon joined King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band. At this time, the personnel in Oliver's band were Joe \\"King\\" Oliver on cornet, Baby Dodds' brother Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Davey Jones on alto saxophone, Honoré Dutrey on trombone, Lil Hardin on piano, Jimmy Palao on violin, and Eddie Garland on bass fiddle. They moved to California in 1921 to work with Oliver there, and they played together for about fifteen months. In 1922, the band, excepting Garland, Palao, and Jones, followed Oliver to Chicago, which would be his base of operations for several years. They began playing at the Lincoln Gardens, and Louis Armstrong also joined this outfit. Dodds describes playing with this band as \\"a beautiful experience\\". Dodds recorded with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Art Hodes, and his brother Johnny Dodds. Dodds played in Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven groups. In May 1927 Armstrong recorded with the Hot Seven, which consisted of Johnny Dodds, Johnny St. Cyr, Lil Hardin Armstrong, John Thomas, Pete Briggs, and Baby Dodds. From September to December 1927 the Hot Five Armstrong assembled consisted of Johnny Dodds, Kid Ory, Johnny St. Cyr, Lonnie Johnson, and Baby Dodds.\\n Passage 2:The UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara encompasses eight places in the old capital Nara in Nara Prefecture, Japan.

During this journey we continue to learn that the physiologic mechanisms that drive proplatelet formation can be recapitulated in cell-free systems and their biochemistry evaluated; the molecular underpinnings of endomitosis are being increasingly understood; the intracellular signals sent by engagement of a large number of megakaryocyte surface receptors have been defined; and many of the transcription factors that drive megakaryocytic fate determination have been identified and experimentally manipulated.

I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.

He studied various readings and their trustworthiness and chose seven 8th-century readers from the cities of Mecca, Medina, Kufa, Basra and Damascus.

The city whose name means \\"Southern Capital\\" has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (江寧), whose former character Jiang (江, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (寧, simplified form 宁, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (京) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later.

Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark yet to be surpassed. \\"\\n\\nWilson made his major league debut with the Giants on September 29, 1923 and became the starting left fielder the following season. By mid-July he was ranked second in the National League (NL) in hitting. He ended the season with a .295 average, 10 home runs, and 57 runs batted in (RBIs) as New York won the NL pennant. In the 1924 World Series he averaged only .233 in a seven-game loss to the Washington Senators.  Multiple stories exist to explain the origin of Wilson's nickname: By one account, a New York newspaper held a nicknaming contest; the winning entry was \\"Hack\\" because he reminded many fans of another stocky athlete, the popular wrestler Georg Hackenschmidt. In another version, McGraw is said to have remarked that Wilson's physique was reminiscent of a \\"hack\\" (slang for taxicab in that era). Giants teammate Bill Cunningham claimed that the nickname was based on Wilson's resemblance to Hack Miller, an outfielder with the Chicago Cubs. The New York Times printed the first documented usage of \\"Hack\\" on June 10, 1924.  Early in the 1925 season Wilson hit the longest home run on record at Ebbets Field against the Brooklyn Robins, but fell into a slump in May, and was replaced in left field by Irish Meusel. On July 2 he hit two home runs in one inning, tying Ken Williams' major league record set in 1922, but his hitting slump continued. In August McGraw told reporters that he had \\"...made the mistake of rushing [Wilson] along,\\" and sent him to the Giants' minor league affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. At season's end, a front office oversight--or possibly, deliberate inaction--left him unprotected on the Toledo roster, and the last-place Chicago Cubs acquired him on waivers. \\"They let go the best outfielder I ever played alongside\\", said Giants right fielder Ross Youngs, \\"and they're going to regret it.\\"  During the 1925 World Series -- between the Senators and the Pittsburgh Pirates -- Wilson's son, Robert, was born.\\n\\nWhat position did he play","target":"left fielder","rationale":"Hackenschmidt became a professional wrestler in the late 1890s, achieving success under both freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling rules.

Adams' first opera, it was inspired by U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.\\nTo create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.\\nFollowing the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.\\n\\n- BBC Worldwide Ltd. is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC, formed out of a restructuring of its predecessor BBC Enterprises in 1995.

Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays.\\n\\n- A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\\n\\n- Kelly Makin is a Canadian television and movie director .

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.\\n\\n- Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada.

In 1980, NLAP used $63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid $5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between $700,000 and $900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said.

Use the right shampoo and conditioner. Dry, brittle ends look like they're begging for a haircut; so a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner can buy you extra weeks—maybe even months—between trims. The latest from Living Proof, a line developed by MIT scientists, contains a special molecule called PolyFluoroEster that smoothes, hydrates and strengthens each strand. It depends on how hard you on it. If it goes through a lot of heat and is always being styled, I'd say every 5-6 weeks. But just enough cut off to get rid of the dead ends. Or it will be worthless to grow your hair out resulting in long split ends. If you do almost nothing to your hair, I'd say every 2 months. Make sure that you get almost all your split ends off when you get it trimmed, or they will just keep growing longer or breaking off. Either way, it isn't good. If you color or highlight your long hair, it is even more likely to be damaged. Regular haircuts help keep your hair strong and healthy. Long hair should be trimmed at least every eight to 12 weeks. If you notice more breakage or split ends, it could be cut as frequently as every six to eight weeks. Be specific with your hairstylist when you're getting your haircut. Best Answer: You should really have a trim every 6-8 weeks to egt rid of split ends. =] ... How Long Between Haircuts ... Depends. If you want long hair, don't cut ... Their unprocessed hair is basically the healthiest it will ever be. If your hair has never been colored and you haven't yet exposed it to the rigors of frequent hot-tool usage (and you're in your early 20s), you can go up to three months between trims without any risk of looking frayed, says hairstylist Nathaniel Hawkins. “When I give a haircut, of course it’s going to look good — you just got it cut,” said Garrett Pike, a head barber at the Brooklyn-based chain Persons of Interest. “But I try to get the most out of every cut.”. Fresh, clean, and ready to face the world, a new chop’s got a kind of empowering quality—it’s as if anything you do in the next 24 to 48 hours will be made infinitely more awesome by the precision of your mane. Stylists want you to use a hydrating hair mask once a week. This is especially true if you're planning an extreme shift, such as from black to blonde. Apply the mask to towel-dried hair three inches down from the roots, then work through to the ends and leave it on for 20 minutes. Voila. With long, blunt-cut hair, trimming the ends of the hair is a simple matter of following the established line and removing the damaged ends. Yet with long-layered hairstyles, there is an alternative that works especially well. Brush out the hair to remove any tangles and section the hair in to workable divisions. But if you color your hair a different shade, you need to be vigilant about the upkeep. Piecuch says anywhere between four and eight weeks is the standard time for a new hair coloring appointment, but that timeframe can vary greatly based on individual factors.

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes 'the principle of equality of its citizens' and is meant to be founded on 'representative democracy'. In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and 'qualified majorities' or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this 'democratic deficit' under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are 'degressively proportional' according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste 'Les Verts' v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power ('kratia') is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people ('demos'): in the EU it is not yet true that 'the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.'

Uterine flushings (UTF) and endometrium (ENDOM) from one uterine horn of nonpregnant and pregnant gilts (n = 9) were collected on days 10, 12, and 14 (n = 3). Protein, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.05), Na+, and K+ (P less than 0.01) increased linearly in UTF of pregnant gilts. Ca2+ changed biphasically, with higher concentrations (P less than 0.01) in pregnant gilts on day 12. Endometrial cAMP and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased between days 12 and 14 of pregnancy. The UTF norepinephrine (NE) concentrations increased (P less than 0.01) in cyclic gilts between days 12 and 14, while endometrial NE increased between days 10 and 12 and then decreased on day 14. The UTF of pregnant gilts had higher (P less than 0.05) concentrations of dopamine (DA), which peaked on day 12 and then decreased (P less than 0.01) by day 14. DA in UTF of nonpregnant gilts decreased between days 10 and 12 and remained low on day 14. A catecholamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, in ENDOM (P less than 0.05) and UTF (P less than 0.01) decreased linearly between days 10 and 14. The turnover rate of endometrial catecholamines was 2.4-fold higher (P less than 0.05) during early pregnancy compared with that in cyclic gilts. Effects of acute administration of exogenous E (0.5 mg) were also studied. The UTF and ENDOM were from day 11 nonpregnant gilts 0, 30, 60, and 360 min (n = 3) post-E or post-saline-ethanol (C) injection (n = 9). Potassium, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.01), and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased rapidly (30 min) after E injection. The K+ level changed biphasically, with increased concentrations again at 360 min. Plasmin inhibitor returned to levels similar to controls by 60 min, whereas cGMP remained elevated until 360 min postinjection when E, Ca2+, K+ (P less than 0.01), and Na+ (P less than 0.03) were increased. ENDOM NE (P less than 0.05) and UTF DA (P less than 0.05) were lower in E-treated gilts. Additionally, the turnover rate was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) for NE and DA in the UTF of E-treated gilts.

He has an older brother, Randy Fowler, who is a limo driver and Rod Stewart impersonator in Boise, Idaho, and a sister, Julie Ann Fowler Keir, an office worker. His family relocated to Southern California when Spacey was four years old. Randy Fowler (from whom Spacey is estranged) has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist \\"Nazi supporter\\", was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey had shut down emotionally and become \\"very sly and smart\\" to avoid whippings.\\n\\nSpacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of Henry VI, Part 1 in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, starring Liv Ullmann. Then he portrayed Philinte in Moliere's The Misanthrope. In 1984, he appeared in a production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's The Seagull. In 1986, he appeared in a production of Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre.  His prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in Jonathan Miller's lauded production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to him and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999. He made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of Crime Story, playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon's Broadway hit Lost in Yonkers. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known.  Some of Spacey's early roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on L.A. Law, the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan (1988), opposite Lemmon, and the comedy See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series Wiseguy. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of a bickering Connecticut couple in the dark comedy film The Ref (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire Swimming with Sharks, and the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics. His performance as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in 1995's The Usual Suspects won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Spacey appeared in the 1995 thriller film Seven, making a sudden entrance late in the film as the serial killer John Doe after going unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in Seven, The Usual Suspects and Outbreak earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards. He remarked in 2013: \\"I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch.\\" Spacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in A Time to Kill (1996), and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. He made his directorial debut with the film Albino Alligator (1996). The film was a failure at the box office, grossing $339,379 with a budget of $6 million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also voiced Hopper in the animated film A Bug's Life (1998).\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Kevin Spacey","rationale":"Kevin Spacey is mentioned numerous times in the passage, which makes it clear that he is the entity."},{"source":"A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms.

Following their 3-1 start to the season, the Bengals had lost all momentum and fallen heavily in the AFC standings.Despite being heavy underdogs, the Bengals came out and grabbed the momentum of the football game early, scoring on their first possession of the game. Playing against a defense that Cincinnati receiver AJ Green remarked \\" a lot of holes,\\" earlier in the week, Green culminated Cincinnati's first possession with a fifty-six yard touchdown reception, beating a badly blown coverage on the play. The score marked Green's eighth straight contest with a touchdown reception, which tied him with former Bengal TJ Houshmandzadeh for second all-time in Bengals history.The ensuing Giants possession was unspectacular, with the Giants going three-and-out and being forced to punt the ball right back to Cincinnati. New York Giant punter Sean Weatherford looked to have gotten a spectacular punt away, which would have forced Cincinnati to start their possession inside their own twenty yard-line. However, a penalty on Giants cornerback Justin Tryon for intentionally leaving the field of play, rendered the punt moot, and forced the Giants to re-attempt the play. On the ensuing punt, Bengals cornerback Adam \\"Pacman\\" Jones returned the ball sixty-eight yards to the Giants eleven yard line. The Bengals did not hesitate to take advantage of the large swing in field positioning, as second year quarterback Andy Dalton connected with receiver Andrew Hawkins for an eleven-yard touchdown strike on third-and-ten. The three play drive took only eighteen second off of the clock, and gave the Bengals a 14-0 advantage. The Giants would see a measure of momentum swing in their favor as following their ensuing possession, which resulted in a three-and-out from New York, Cincinnati receiver Brandon Tate would fumble Sean Weatherford's punt, giving the Giants possession of the football inside Cincinnati territory for the first time on the afternoon. The Giants would somewhat take advantage of the mistake, as they would turn the fumble into a twenty-three yard field goal by placekicker Lawrence Tynes. After both teams traded punts, the Bengals would proceed to expand their lead further, putting together a fifteen play drive that took over seven minutes off of the clock and resulted in a twenty-eight yard field goal by Mike Nugent. The conversion put Cincinnati up by a score of 17-3 with time dwindling in the first half. The ensuing Giants possession would take all but eleven second of the 4:17 that remained in the opening half and would see Lawrence Tynes trotted out to convert on a thirty-one yard field goal at its finish. The points got the Giants back to within eleven points at the half, with the score 17-6 in favour of Cincinnati.The first five possessions coming out of the half, two of which ended in New York Giant turnovers, would not result in any points being scored by either team. However, following an Eli Manning interception, Cincinnati would be able to take advantage of the short field and pick up their third touchdown on the afternoon. The Bengals second three-play touchdown drive of the game was capped off by Andy Dalton hitting tight end Jermaine Gresham for a ten-yard receiving touchdown, making the score 24-6 in favour of Cincinnati.New York's next possession would result in Eli Manning firing a second straight interception. The result for Cincinnati would be the same, with Dalton culminating yet another three-play touchdown drive by hitting first-year receiver Mohamed Sanu for a ten-yard strike. The touchdown was Sanu's first receiving touchdown in the National Football League, though he had already thrown for a touchdown in Cincinnati's week 3 encounter with the Washington Redskins. The touchdown, also representing a career-high fourth on the afternoon for Andy Dalton, gave the Bengals their final points of the afternoon, and a 31-6 advantage.The rest of the game was largely uneventful, with both teams accepting the fate of the game as having already been determined. The Giants were able to put up their lone touchdown of the game following a thirteen play, ninety-eight yard possession that was capped by running back Ahmad Bradshaw punching the ball in from two yards away. The lone Giants touchdown of the afternoon would also be the last points put up, making the final score 31-13 Cincinnati. With the victory, the Bengals snapped their previous four game losing streak and improved their record to 4-5 on the season. They also improved to 6-0 all time against the Giants at home.\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that the group \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.\\" The lyrics of the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and \\"the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all\\", in contrast to \\"humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same.\\" Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy Society of the Spectacle by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\".

The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D.\\nScientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements  to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against \\"sun bingeing\\".\\nThe government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day.\\nVitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight. Dr Barbara Boucher said adults should get 5 to 25 micrograms a day. Shortage of vitamin D may be linked to diseases such as muscle weakness, high blood pressure and rickets .\\nDr Birgit Teucher gave several reasons for the lack among Britons. Increasing numbers of office-based jobs mean a lack of exposure to the sun; and the rise of becoming overweight means that vitamin D--which is fat soluble is increasingly stored in body fat, where it cannot be accessed readily.\\nProfessor Brian Wharton of the Institute of Child Health said that children in particular needed to have enough vitamin D to prevent rickets.\\nProfessor Graham Bentham, an environmental scientist at the...\\nQuestion: Which best describes the writer's tone in the passage?\\nAnswer:","target":"Objective.","rationale":"The writer's tone is neutral throughout the entire passage and does not express any opinion or bias towards a particular subject.\\nSo, the answer would be Objective."},{"source":"Answer based on context:\\n\\nThough the Raiders had lost eleven straight games dating back to Week 9 of the 2006 season, they were favored to beat the Cleveland Browns.

To solve the problem, some regularization adversarial training methods, constraining the output label or logit, have been studied. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized adversarial training framework ATLPA,namely Adversarial Tolerant Logit Pairing with Attention. Instead of constraining a hard distribution (e.g., one-hot vectors or logit) in adversarial training, ATLPA uses Tolerant Logit which consists of confidence distribution on top-k classes and captures inter-class similarities at the image level. Specifically, in addition to minimizing the empirical loss, ATLPA encourages attention map for pairs of examples to be similar. When applied to clean examples and their adversarial counterparts, ATLPA improves accuracy on adversarial examples over adversarial training. We evaluate ATLPA with the state of the art algorithms, the experiment results show that our method outperforms these baselines with higher accuracy. Compared with previous work, our work is evaluated under highly challenging PGD attack: the maximum perturbation $\\\\epsilon$ is 64 and 128 with 10 to 200 attack iterations.","target":"In this paper, we propose a novel regularized adversarial training framework ATLPA,namely Adversarial Tolerant Logit Pairing with Attention","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nIn this paper, we propose a novel regularized adversarial training framework ATLPA,namely Adversarial Tolerant Logit Pairing with Attention."},{"source":"Background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.\\n\\nParagraph: Burma had many tropical forests, while a sister country from a temperate climate, Belarus, had beautiful ancient temperate forests.

Under the guidance of the management duo, the Royals were promoted to Division 1 after finishing as runners-up to Brighton & Hove Albion in the 2001–02 season. Pardew resigned in September 2003 and Dillon stepped in as the caretaker manager, until Steve Coppell was appointed in October 2003. At this point Dillon reverted to his role as the number two.

Over the last 20 years much effort has been put into clarifying the role that viral respiratory infections play in the eventual development of asthma. Scope of review: In this review we give a general background of the role of viruses in the processes of asthma exacerbation and asthma induction. We review recent additions to the literature in the last 3 years with particular focus on clinical and epidemiologic investigations of influenza, rhinovirus, bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus. Major conclusions: The development of asthma emerges from a complex interaction of genetic predisposition and environmental factors with viral infection likely playing a significant role in the effect of environment on asthma inception. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Biochemistry of Asthma. General significance: Further understanding of the role that viruses play in asthma exacerbation and inception will contribute to decreased asthma morbidity in the future.

The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.

Thus Kant defines idealism as \\"the assertion that we can never be certain whether all of our putative outer experience is not mere imagining\\". He claimed that, according to idealism, \\"the reality of external objects does not admit of strict proof. On the contrary, however, the reality of the object of our internal sense (of myself and state) is clear immediately through consciousness.\\"  However, not all idealists restrict the real or the knowable to our immediate subjective experience. Objective idealists make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to the mental. Thus Plato and Gottfried Leibniz affirm an objective and knowable reality transcending our subjective awareness—a rejection of epistemological idealism—but propose that this reality is grounded in ideal entities, a form of metaphysical idealism. Nor do all metaphysical idealists agree on the nature of the ideal; for Plato, the fundamental entities were non-mental abstract forms, while for Leibniz they were proto-mental and concrete monads.\\nWhat is the answer to this question: Who are subjective idealists opposed to?","target":"realists","rationale":"The answer to the question is \\"realists\\". \\nSubjective idealism, or empirical idealism, is a monistic doctrine according to which only minds and mental contents exist.

However it found its greatest support in Continental Europe where it influenced Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as well as later German Idealists such as Fichte, Schelling and Hegel.

To clarify the nature of glutamine (substrate of ammonia production) transport in PST, both luminal resorption and peritubular uptake of glutamine were measured in isolated rabbit PST. Luminal glutamine resorption (Jgln) was measured at various perfusate glutamine concentration (0.05 to 20 mM) at 38 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Jgln measured at 12 degrees C were proportional to mean luminal glutamine concentrations. This flux was thought to be a passive glutamine flux. The flux, which was obtained by subtracting passive glutamine flux from Jgln obtained at 38 degrees C, was thought to be active luminal resorption. This flux exhibited saturation kinetics (Vmax 20.9 pmol min-1 X mm-1, km 5.2 mM). When bath pH (HCO3) was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8, Jgln showed no change or a small decrease (12%) at perfusate glutamine concentrations of 0.05 or 5 mM, respectively. When perfusate pH (HCO3) was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8 Jgln showed a small decrease (10%) at 5 mM perfusate glutamine concentration. Peritubular glutamine uptake was determined in isolated nonperfused PST incubated for 5 to 50 min in [14C]-glutamine containing solution. When incubated in pH 7.4 HCO3 buffer solution, cell to medium 14C concentration ratio was higher than unity (3.83 +/- 0.34, P less than 0.001) at 5 min, and reached a maximum (11.37 +/- 1.13) at 30 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","target":"Absorption","rationale":"This article mainly focuses on the absorption of glutamine in the proximal straight tubules (PST), which is an important nephron segment of renal ammonia production.

I'm usually pretty great at fixing all manner of IT related problems, especially when it comes to computers. I think to those more uninformed when it comes to technology, I appear to be like some god like hacker Neo from the Matrix, when in reality I just try a bunch of fairly generic solutions until one fits. \\n\\nAnyway, this morning my mum's friend reached out saying that last night she had a power outage while her PC was performing Windows updates (gotta love Windows 10) and of course it completely fucked her computer. I had a similar problem before where a PC I had refurbished was updating when my mum yanked the power cord out halfway through. It ended up being a real pain in the ass to fix and I ended up just reinstalling Windows. Between work, university, gym and my daily mental breakdowns, I find there's not much room to schedule a whole lot else, especially with my downright superhuman procrastination. Today though I have most of the afternoon free and I finally made myself a horrid keto coffee (yay weightloss) when I replied to her message, asking her to describe the issue in more detail and I asked if she could still access Windows. She proceeds to ignore that question and send a bunch of utterly useless messages like \\"I can't get into it\\" and \\"I dunno Its not working\\". She sends me some pictures and I ask her if she's able to run Windows Updates again to possibly rectify the issue. She calls me and asks me to come in to fix it. I know for a fact that it'll probably eat up a good couple hours or so of my time at least, especially since its an OEM machine that's more locked down and the BIOS can be a pain in the ass on them. If I have to reinstall Windows for her, I'd have to prepare an install disk and go through the entire process which would take hourssssss.

Thus, a person has to work more hours to pay for the same thing.\\nFor example, let's say that this year a loaf of bread costs $1.00 and average salary in the United Sates is $10.00 per hour. That means a person could earn enough money to buy a loaf of bread in one-tenth of an hour, or six minutes. Then, halfway through the year, the price of the bread goes up to $1.25, while salary stay the same. That means that a person now has to work one-eighth of an hour--seven and a half minutes to buy the same loaf of bread.\\nNow let's say that at the end of the year, salary go up to $11.00 per hour, but the price of bread goes up to $1.50. Now a person has to work more than one-seventh of an hour--over eight minutes--to buy loaves of bread, employees will have less money left over to buy other things, Inflation means that the same money buys fewer things and everybody's standard of living goes down, even if salaries are going up.\\nSome kinds of inflation are worse than others. Moderate inflation does not distort  relative prices or incomes seriously. Galloping inflation happens rapidly, say at a rate of 100percent or more within a year.

In some contexts it may be considered a leisure activity as well as an economic one.\\n\\n- Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\\n\\n- An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since \\"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\\", the term \\"official language\\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government.\\n\\n- Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual.\\nAdvertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\".\\n\\n- Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.\\n\\n- Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.\\n\\n- Uno-X is a chain of unmanned fuel stations throughout Norway and Denmark. It is operated as the low-cost section of YX Energi. The chain was originally created as a low cost chain in Denmark in the late 1950s. The rights to use the name in Sweden were sold to Britain's Burmah Oil. In 1991 Norsk Hydro acquired the 330 outlets of the Danish operation and five years later it bought the Swedish Uno-X chain from Burmah. \\n\\n- Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\\n\\n- The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\\n\\n- YX Energi, formerly known as Hydro Texaco, is a Norwegian and Danish gas station chain formed after the merge of the Hydro and Texaco gas station chains in 1995. In 2006 the company was bought by Reitangruppen and incorporated into their chain including the implementation of 7-Eleven brand on the service stations. Uno-X and Rema Bensin are low-cost brand names of YX.\\n\\n- A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy.\\nMonarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...\\n\\n- Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin.\\n\\n- Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk.

He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three. Many contemporary philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have not embraced Popper's Three World conjecture, due mostly, it seems, to its resemblance to mind-body dualism.\\n\\nWhat did Popper argue was objective and independent of its subject?","target":"knowledge","rationale":"As stated in the context, knowledge is objective and independent of its subject."},{"source":"In this task, you need to provide the correct option for a given problem from the provided options.\\n\\nProblem: a certain hobby shop sold model cars for $ 5.00 each and model trains for $ 8.00 each . if a customer purchased both cars and trains from the store for a total of $ 31.00 , what total number of cars and trains did the customer purchase ? \\nOptions: a ) 3 , b ) 4 , c ) 5 , d ) 6 , e ) 7","target":"c","rationale":"Let there be 'x' cars and 'y' trains.\\\\n\\nThe total cost of the purchase is 5x + 8y = 31 (as stated in the question).\\\\n\\nWe know that x and y are whole numbers, so we need to find out the integers that satisfy this equation.

He succeeded in maintaining his job until the end of the tournament, and in leading the rossoblù to maintain a place in the next Serie A; he left Cagliari at the end of the season. On 14 November 2006, Sonetti was appointed to replace Attilio Tesser at the helm of then last-placed relegation-battling Serie A Ascoli. He did not manage to save his side from falling to Serie B, and ended his experience in Ascoli at the end of the season with a second-last place.

He resigned from his post on 19 December, but was confirmed by the club the next day after Marco Giampaolo rejected to return at the helm of the club.

Weber's law predicts the delta R50 (the added load detectable on 50% of presentations) to be a fixed percent of the background resistance (R0) and thus the delta R50/R0 ratio (the Weber fraction) is constant. We have noted the nose to be sensitive to added load, we wondered if the nose might play a role in RLD. To determine whether this was true and to characterize the effects of changes in R0 in the range of normal nasal resistance (RN), we determined R0 and delta R50 using standard techniques under the following conditions: nose vs. decongested nose, nose vs. nose with added external R0 (3.0 and 8.0 cmH2O X l-1 X s), nose vs. anesthetized nose, nose vs. mouth, and mouth vs. mouth with added load (3 cmH2O X l-1 X s). We found that decongestant decreased RN [4.3 +/- 0.6 (SE) to 3.1 +/- 0.5 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05] and delta R50 (1.7 +/- 0.5 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 cmH2O X l-1 X s, P less than 0.05). When an external load of 3 cmH2O X l-1 X s was added to the nose, delta R50 did not change significantly (1.4 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.2 cmH2O X l-1 X s), but the Weber fraction decreased (0.28 +/- 0.05 to 0.15 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","target":"Role of the nose in resistive load detection","rationale":"The title should be short and concise.

Results of this study indicate that pretreatment of male F344 rats with the calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, or Mg2+ significantly protected against ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions as demonstrated by gross and histopathologic evaluation. Treatment of rats with calcium channel blockers before ethanol or indomethacin administration resulted in a significant decline in the mean number of lesions per glandular stomach, the damaged area of the glandular stomach, and the severity of lesions. Calcium channel blockers also caused a significant decline in the incidence of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions, but had no effect on the incidence of ethanol-induced gastric lesions. These results offer the first evidence that calcium channel blockers may play an important role in the protection against chemically induced gastric lesions and thereby offer insight into the mechanism of gastric ulcer formation. It is speculated that this knowledge may prove important in the development of new and improved therapies for the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers in humans.","target":"Alcohol, Ethyl","rationale":"The abstract reveals that calcium channel blockers can prevent the formation of gastric lesions induced by ethanol and indomethacin, but has no effect on the incidence of ethanol-induced gastric lesions.

He later served on Greenland whalers, but in 1795 was seized by a press gang at Wapping and forcibly recruited into the Royal Navy. Due a superior education (although where he obtained this education is unknown), Bartholomew was rapidly promoted to midshipman, serving in numerous theatres and becoming a favourite of Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham. Bartholomew was present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in 1799, on HMS Romney in the East Indies and in 1802 was in charge of the ship's chronometers during a voyage to the Red Sea. The Peace of Amiens in the same year saw a reduction in the Navy and Bartholomew was placed in reserve.\\n Passage 2:The idea of a national cathedral first emerged following the Romanian War of Independence (1877–1878), which was mainly fought between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. The church was to symbolise the victory of Orthodox Christians over the Ottoman Muslims. The idea was shelved for lack of consensus on design, location and funding. The Unification of the Romanian Principalities in 1859, entailed a unitary organization of church structures in Moldavia and Wallachia within the Holy Synod (1872), thus the assembly of hierarchs increased to 12 members, including: the Primate Metropolitan (chairman), the Metropolitan of Moldavia and their suffragan bishops of Râmnic, Buzău, Argeș, Roman, Huși and Lower Danube (Galați) and one auxiliary vicar-bishop for every diocese. The old Metropolitan Cathedral had proved overcrowded, especially during the national holidays, such as the Proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania and the crowning of the First King Carol I (10 May 1881), when none of the over one hundred churches in Bucharest were able to receive those who would have wanted to participate in the official service.

Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his..., what would be the answer ?","target":"Cooke","rationale":"The answer is Cooke.\\nCooke said that Mahler's middle period works were \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\"."},{"source":"Answer the question below:\\n\\n\\nThe logging company in your town is proposing they plant several thousand acres of trees.

Analysis of three-point crosses, in turn, placed the latter locus 19 cM distal to Sd on chromosome 2. We have designated the two loci Cfh and C5, respectively.

Fructose absorption was quantified with lactulose standards. Significant hydrogen production (greater than or equal to 20 ppm rise of breath hydrogen) was found after challenge with 10% solutions of 50, 37.5, 25, 20, and 15 g fructose in eight, seven, five, four and one subjects, respectively. One subject showed malabsorption after a 10 g dose and possibly also 5 g fructose. In contrast, no malabsorption could be detected in any of the 10 subjects after ingestion of 100 g, 75 g, or 50 g sucrose or a mixture of 50 g glucose and 50 g fructose. After ingestion of mixtures of 50 g fructose +25 g glucose and 50 g fructose +12.5 g glucose malabsorption was present in three and seven subjects, respectively. Symptoms during all challenges were mild, or absent. It is concluded that in the healthy state the absorption capacity of fructose given alone ranges from less than 5 g to more than 50 g. The absorption capacity of fructose given as sucrose is much higher. Glucose stimulates fructose uptake in a dose dependent fashion. The possible existence of more than one intestinal transport system for fructose is considered. The elucidation of the clinical relevance of the findings is important. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"This abstract describes the results of a study that measured the hydrogen production in different subjects after they ingested various doses of fructose or fructose-containing foods (sucrose, glucose and mixtures of 95% fructose).

Saosin first became popular through promotion and exposure through the Internet. They became known for their distinct musical styles long before their first studio-length album was released, and were popularized on social networking and music sites such as MySpace. The E.P. has sold an estimated 62,000 copies.  Bassist Zach Kennedy left the band early on, as he wanted to pursue a career in art. He was later replaced by Chris Sorenson. A local Southern Califonian drummer by the name of Pat Magrath,  was hired only for the recording for the EP, according to Burchell.

He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

The Ravens' defense welcomed him rudely on his first drive with an interception by Ed Reed. The Ravens were able to attain good field position consistently throughout the first half, and quarterback Kyle Boller (who himself was starting in place of an injured starting quarterback, Steve McNair), capitalized with a two-yard touchdown to Willis McGahee late in the first quarter. The teams traded field goals to start the second quarter; Jets kicker Mike Nugent hit a 50-yard field goal, followed by Matt Stover hitting a 28-yard attempt for the Ravens. After Stover missed a 46-yard try, the Jets tried to respond with Nugent attempting a 52-yard field goal, but Nugent missed wide left, his first miss in twenty attempts dating back to last season. Boller once again took advantage of the short field provided and hit tight end Todd Heap on a four-yard touchdown with six seconds left in the half to extend the Ravens' lead to 17-3. Heap's catch was initially ruled incomplete, but the call was subjected to a booth review and reversed, as replays showed he was able to touch both feet within the end zone. After a quiet third quarter, Stover hit a 43-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter, and extended Baltimore's lead to seventeen. Baltimore's defense, which ranked as the best in the NFL in 2006, was able to shut down Clemens and the Jets for most of the game, but Clemens was able to rally the team in the fourth quarter. Using a no huddle offense, Clemens drove the team down to the Baltimore three-yard line, before the Jets settled for a 21-yard field goal. On the Jets' next possession, 44 and 24-yard strikes by Clemens to Jerricho Cotchery got the Jets to the Ravens' goal line, where he found tight end Chris Baker for a three-yard touchdown, cutting the Jets' deficit to seven. Though the Jets failed to convert the ensuing onside kick, poor clock management by Boller gave the Jets the ball back with 2:38 left in the game. Clemens immediately found Cotchery on a 50-yard catch-and-run, later followed by a 24-yard pass to Laveranues Coles that brought the Jets' to the Baltimore seven-yard line with just over a minute to go. Clemens passed to Justin McCareins for a potential touchdown, but the pass was dropped by McCareins. A second pass to McCareins in the end zone deflected off him and into the arms of Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis for the game-ending interception. The loss made the Jets 8-20 since 2002 in games not started by Chad Pennington.\\n\\nHow many touchdowns did the Ravens score in the second quarter?","target":"1","rationale":"The Ravens scored two touchdowns in the first quarter (Kyle Boller and Willis McGahee), one touchdown in the second quarter (Todd Heap) and none touchdowns in both third, fourth quarters.

In its early days the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society. After Beecham's death in 1961 the orchestra's fortunes declined steeply; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra's right to call itself \\"Royal\\" could be withdrawn. Since Beecham's death the RPO has had seven chief conductors, including Rudolf Kempe, Antal Dorati, Andre Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy, and most recently Charles Dutoit.\\nContext: In 1932 the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham had founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), which, with the backing of rich supporters, he ran until 1940, when finances dried up in wartime. Beecham left to conduct in Australia and then the US; the orchestra continued without him after reorganising itself as a self-governing body. On Beecham's return to England in September 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham responded, \\"I emphatically refuse to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career.\\" In 1945 he conducted the first concert of Walter Legge's new Philharmonia Orchestra, but was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO. His new orchestra to rival the Philharmonia would, he told Legge, be launched in \\"the most auspicious circumstances and eclat\\".  In 1946 Beecham reached an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society: his new orchestra would replace the LPO at all the Society's concerts. He thus gained the right to name the new ensemble the \\"Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\\", an arrangement approved by George VI. Beecham arranged with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne seasons. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated. The music critic Lyndon Jenkins writes:  Naturally, it quickly became known that he was planning another orchestra, at which the cry \\"He'll never get the players!\\" went up just as it had done in 1932. Beecham was unmoved: \\"I always get the players,\\" he retorted. \\"Among other considerations, they are so good they refuse to play under anybody but me\\".\\nQuestion: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?.

The 11th REI defended the northern Inor Wood near Verdun from the German offensive early on in the battle until June 11, 1940 when the regiment began a fighting retreat to the south. By June 18, the 11th REI had lost three-fourths of its strength and the regiment withdrew to the south near Toul. The 12th REI was redeployed from its training center in Valbonne on May 11 to defend the Soissons where it arrived on May 24 and eventually began to fortify their positions. The 12 REI first experienced a form of combat for which they were unprepared when on June 5, the town of Soissons was the subject of German strafing from Stukas. By June 8, the 12th REI, in danger of being encircled, received orders to retreat to the south, however the orders did not come soon enough and parts of the 12th REI were surrounded at Soissons; the rest of the 12th REI made their way to Limoges by the signing of Second Armistice at Compiègne on June 25, 1940. By the surrender of France the 12th REI had lost 2,500 of its number. The 21st Marching Regiment of Foreign Volunteers was deployed to the Maginot Line when the German offensive began, but was shifted to the north of Verdun by the end of May. The 21st RMVE took heavy losses during an engagement with the Germans on June 8 and 9; the 21st RMVE joined the rest of the French Army in that sector in retreat when the order to retreat was given. At the time of the armistice the 21st RMVE was at Nancy where it was disarmed by German forces. The 22nd Marching Regiment of the Foreign Volunteers left its training depot at Bacarès on May 6 when it was deployed around Alsace. The German offensive forced the 22nd RMVE to be quickly redeployed on the Somme near the village of Marchélepot where it fought a defensive action from May 22 to May 26. On June 5, the 22nd RMVE was preparing to counterattack the Germans at Villers-Carbonnel alongside the 112th Infantry Division when it came under a heavy preemptive attack launched by German forces in the area. The French Forces were able to initially repulse the attack, but later succumbed to the German onslaught; the force of the Foreign Legion acquitted themselves admirably in that engagement.\\n Passage 2:Originally from the small city of Minden in Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana, Spiva was the son of Hubert Spiva, Sr. (1899-1939), a former foreign correspondent, and the former Lilla Ellenor Stewart (1906–1959), who married in 1929. They operated the Webster Printing Company and the former The Minden Herald and The Webster Review newspapers, forerunners of the Minden Press-Herald. Lilla Spiva, a scion of a prominent Webster Parish family, was a daughter of Minden attorney Daniel Webster Stewart, Sr. (1857-1935), and his wife, the former Alice Leona Reagan (1871-1954). She was a niece of William Green Stewart, a farmer and a former president of the Webster Parish School Board, for whom the since defunct William G. Stewart Elementary School in Minden is named.

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a $100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a $250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.

MWS has been reported in association with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). MWS is sometimes difficult to diagnose clinically, especially when HSCR is absent. Thus, it is necessary to detect gene abnormalities at the molecular level. Here we report two Japanese girls with MWS, who showed a distinct facial phenotype, severe intellectual disability and epileptic seizures. Major congenital anomalies of the patients were very different. Patient 1 suffered from severe congenital heart disease, but did not show apparent HSCR. Patient 2 suffered from typical HSCR and underwent surgical treatment, but did not have congenital heart disease. According to the gene analysis using white blood cells, they had nonsense mutations in ZFHX1B, R695X and Q433X, respectively. In conclusion, molecular genetic analysis of ZFHX1B is important for a definite diagnosis of MWS which has a wide phenotypic spectrum of congenital anomalies. \\n Question: Which gene is responsible for the development of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome?","target":"zeb2","rationale":"The answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.

After an incomplete pass, Brady hit receiver Julian Edelman for 8 yards, but on 3rd-and-2, Brady was sacked by Lavonte David and Mark Barron and the Patriots punted. Josh Freeman drove the Buccaneers 50 yards in 8 plays, but Ryan Lindell missed a 38-yard field goal. The Patriots punted again on their next drive.

Culture Club sold more than 50 million albums and 100 million singles (including Boy George solo) records worldwide, including 7 million-records awards RIAA certificate in the United States.\\n\\nThe band's second album, Colour by Numbers (UK No. 1, US No. 2), was released in 1983. The first single, \\"Church of the Poison Mind\\", featuring backing vocalist Helen Terry, reached the UK and US Top 10. The second single, \\"Karma Chameleon\\", gave the band their biggest hit, peaking at No. 1 in the UK (the band's second chart-topper there), where it became the best selling single of 1983 and has sold 1.5 million copies there to date. It also peaked at No. 1 in the US for three consecutive weeks, and would ultimately hit No. 1 in 30 countries, thus becoming one of the top twenty best-selling singles of the 1980s sold up 7 million copies worldwide, with one of the most iconic images of Boy George on the cover shot by photographer David Levine.  The album Colour by Numbers would spawn more hits including \\"Miss Me Blind\\" (#5 US), \\"It's a Miracle\\" (#4 UK, No. 13 US), and \\"Victims\\" (#3 UK), and sold four million copies in the US and another five million worldwide at its time of release. The album gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group in music history to have an album certified diamond in Canada (for sales of one million copies in that country). The band also won the 1984 Brit Award for Best Group and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, where George gave a speech via satellite stating, \\"Thanks America, you've got style, you've got taste, and you know a good drag queen when you see one.\\"  The group's back-up singer, Helen Terry, began work on her solo album, for which George and Hay wrote the song \\"Love Lies Lost\\". The pair also wrote \\"Passing Friend\\" for the Beach Boys' album. Culture Club wrote two songs for the soundtrack to the movie Electric Dreams. George and Hay wrote \\"The Dream\\" and \\"Love Is Love\\", with the latter being released as a single in Canada and Japan, the E.P \\"Love is Love\\" became a major hit in Japan. George also collaborated on the song \\"Electric Dreams\\", sung by P. P. Arnold. The song was written with Phil Pickett (former member of the 1970s band Sailor) who had also co-written \\"Karma Chameleon\\" and frequently played keyboards for the group.  Despite Culture Club's commercial success, there were significant pressures within the band. George was using drugs with money from his new-found fame. George and Moss were also romantically involved with each other, which was unknown to the public and the media at the time. Their relationship lasted for over four years and was often turbulent, with alleged physical and verbal abuse.

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime.

He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history.

Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work.

His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \\"parting gift\\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \\"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day.

The shape depends mainly on the temperature and water levels in the air. The shape of a snow crystal may change from one form to another as the crystal passes through levels of air with different temperatures. Snow contains much less water than rain. About seventy-five centimeters of snow has as much water as two and one-half centimeters of rain.\\nGenerally, the color1 of snow and ice appears white. This is because the light we see from the sun is white. Most natural materials take in some sunlight. However, when light travels from air to snow, some light is sent back, or reflected ( ). Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight. It is this light that gives snow its white color1.\\nMuch of the water we use comes from snow. Melting snow gives water to rivers and crops. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold. Fresh snow is made largely of air which is kept among the snow crystals.

She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives.\\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\\nThat’s right, you STOP!\\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\\nThis isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).\\nQuestion: Who wrote the book \\"Come As You Are\\"?\\nOptions:\\n- A student\\n- Emily Nagoski\\n- An anonymous author\\n- not enough information","target":"Emily Nagoski","rationale":"The text clearly states that Emily Nagoski wrote the book \\"Come As You Are\\".\\nFrom this, we can conclude that she is not a student and she has existed as more than an anonymous author."},{"source":"Given a simple high-school level math question, you are required to solve it and provide the final answer.
