Injured Jacksonville starting quarterback David Garrard was replaced by Quinn Gray, while Jeff Garcia hoped to extend on a 217-consecutive passing streak without an interception. In the first half, Jacksonville's running attack of Fred Taylor, LaBrandon Toefield and Maurice Jones-Drew rushed 15 times in their first 16 plays from scrimmage, and eventually set up a 10-3 lead. In the second quarter, Garcia threw his first interception of the season, which was returned for a Jacksonville score. Tampa Bay quickly responded, however, driving 81 yards in three plays, capped off with Garcia and Joey Galloway connecting for a 58-yard touchdown. A momentum shift appeared to occur near the end of the second quarter, as Tampa Bay forced Jacksonville into a 3-and-out. Inside the two-minute warning, Garcia drove the Buccaneers to the 4-yard line. Garcia scrambled on 3rd & 10, colliding with Reggie Nelson, losing his helmet, but fell one yard short of the first down. Tampa Bay settled for a Matt Bryant field goal, and a 13-17 halftime deficit. Tampa Bay's defense dominated the third quarter, forcing Jacksonville a turnover on downs, a fumble in the end zone (recovered by Gray on 1-yard line), and a blocked punt. The good field position led to Michael Bennett's first touchdown as a Buccaneer. The fourth quarter saw Jacksonville re-take the lead with an 8-yard touchdown pass. Despite two late drives starting with decent field position, Tampa Bay's effort died when Garcia's pass was deflected and intercepted with 19 seconds remaining, his third pick of the game.

When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time.\\nThe payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort.\\nDavid Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following:\\nDoing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality.\\nMany studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix.\\nImagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions.

Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment.

Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar.

The final song of the radio show, a \\"Bonus Track\\" was played and sounded reminiscent of prior From First to Last work with Moore's vocals, but had a lyric referencing SnapChat, indicating that the song was likely new. An Alternative Press article regarding a possible reunion with Moore and the band was also shared on From First to Last's Facebook page.  On August 1, 2016, Spencer Sotelo announced on Twitter that he no longer considers himself a member of the band. He also hinted that Sonny Moore is going to reunite with the band.  On January 15, 2017, the band released a new single, \\"Make War\\", featuring vocalist Sonny Moore and original drummer Derek Bloom returning to the band (Although in the single it was actually recorded by Blink-182's drummer, Travis Barker as noted by their Instagram.) Their first show back with Moore and Bloom was on February 7, during an Emo Night event in Los Angeles, California. This marked the band's first live performance with Moore in ten years and Bloom since his departure in 2010. Longtime bassist Matt Manning also appeared with the band during the show; having only performed alongside Moore briefly before his initial departure from the band. Aside from debuting \\"Make War\\" live, the band played a set featuring material strictly off of Dear Diary... The show was live streamed on Skrillex's instagram account. It is unknown if this was a one off performance or the first of many for the band. Guitarist Taylor Larson was not present at the performance, and is no longer a member of the band.  In 2017, Moore stated that \\"Make War\\" was the first song that came out quick. He later stated that the band plans to release more music.  In December 2017, the band released a new song entitled \\"Surrender\\" at L.A's emo night. This makes the first single with all members from the \\"Sonny\\" era (no guest drummers, etc.).\\n\\nEntity:","target":"From First to Last","rationale":"The text describes a band called From First to Last and their work.

But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed.

Some of his compositions were published and performed; the previous year The Times had praised his song \\"Light Leaves Whisper\\", \\"a moderately elaborate composition in six parts, treated with a good deal of expression and poetic feeling\\".Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst found that \\"man cannot live by composition alone\\"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\", conducted by Stanislas Wurm.Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for \\"the Worm\\" or any other light orchestra \\"a wicked and loathsome waste of time\\". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted that some of the music was \\"trashy\\" but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: \\"To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience.\\"With a modest income secured, Holst was able to marry Isobel; the ceremony was at Fulham Register...","target":"Vaughan Williams","rationale":"The article talks about Gustav Holst, who has a wife named Isobel.

This was a recognizable category of mathematical activity from the 19th century onwards, at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of navigation, astronomy, physics, economics, engineering, and so on.\\n\\n- Leopold Kronecker (7 December 1823  29 December 1891) was a German mathematician who worked on number theory, algebra and logic. He criticized Cantor's work on set theory, and was quoted by as having said, \\"\\"\\"\\" (\\"God made the integers, all else is the work of man.\\"). Kronecker was a student and lifelong friend of Ernst Kummer.\\n\\n- Ballistics is the science of mechanics that deals with the launching, flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles, especially bullets, gravity bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.\\n\\n- A rocket (from Italian \\"rocchetto\\" \\"bobbin\\") is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space.\\n\\n- Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.\\n\\n- Number theory or, in older usage, arithmetic is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. It is sometimes called \\"The Queen of Mathematics\\" because of its foundational place in the discipline. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers).\\n\\n- Applied mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with mathematical methods that find use in science, engineering, business, computer science, and industry. Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge. The term \\"applied mathematics\\" also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models. In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake. The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.\\n\\n- Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.\\n\\n- Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.\\n\\n- Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects.\\n\\n- Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians.\\n\\n- Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\\n\\n- Ernst Eduard Kummer ( 29 January 1810 -- 14 May 1893 ) was a German mathematician . Skilled in applied mathematics , Kummer trained German army officers in ballistics ; afterwards , he taught for 10 years in a gymnasium , the German equivalent of high school , where he inspired the mathematical career of Leopold Kronecker .\\n\\n- A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.\\n\\n- A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br>\\nIt can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox.\\n\\n- The word bullet is a firearm term. A bullet is a projectile expelled from the barrel of a firearm. The term is from Middle French and originated as the diminutive of the word boulle (boullet) which means \\"small ball.\\" Bullets are made of a variety of materials. They are available singly as they would be used in muzzle loading and cap and ball firearms, as part of a paper cartridge, and much more commonly as a component of metallic cartridges. Bullets are made in a large numbers of styles and constructions depending on how they will be used. Many bullets have specialized functions, such as hunting, target shooting, training, defense, and warfare. \\n\\n- Mechanics (Greek ) is an area of science concerned with the behaviour of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.\\nThe scientific discipline has its origins in Ancient Greece with the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). During the early modern period, scientists such as Khayaam, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton, laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics.\\nIt is a branch of classical physics that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. \\nIt can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on objects.\\n\\n- Industry is the production of goods or related services within an economy. The major source of revenue of a group or company is the indicator of its relevant industry. When a large group has multiple sources of revenue generation, it is considered to be working in different industries. Manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution, upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies. This came through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the production of steel and coal.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'field of work' with the subject 'ernst kummer'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- action\\n - algebra\\n - arabic\\n - art\\n - astronomy\\n - computer science\\n - computing\\n - design\\n - early modern period\\n - economics\\n - economy\\n - engineering\\n - french\\n - hunting\\n - information\\n - language\\n - mathematical logic\\n - mathematician\\n - mathematics\\n - mechanics\\n - number theory\\n - production\\n - research\\n - science\\n - scientist\\n - set theory\\n - training","target":"number theory","rationale":"Ernst Kummer was a German mathematician who worked on number theory, algebra and logic.

Its primary goals, as stated in its Covenant, included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe.

They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights \\"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,\\" and which are \\"inherent in all human beings\\" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.\\n\\n- The Organization of American States, or the OAS or OEA, is an intercontinental organization founded on 30 April 1948, for the purposes of regional solidarity and cooperation among its member states.

Park-our now enjoys the devotion of many die-hard fans across the world and has been the source for much inspiration.\\nBut what is park-our? It is the art of using only your body to navigate from Point A to B in the least time possible, which involves besides leaping, climbing and sprinting, various unusual and complex movements to overcome barriers. Just like the James Bond in the movie Casino Royale? Bond jumps down from a roof to a windowsill and then runs several blocks over _ on the way. It is just because of Bond's wonderful performances that the sport has become popular worldwide.\\nYes, that's pork-our, an extreme street sport aimed at moving from one point to another as quickly as possible, getting over all the obstacles in the path using only the abilities of the human body. Park-our is considered an extreme sport. As its participants dash around a city, they may jump over fences, run up walls and even move from rooftop to rooftop.\\nPark-our can be just as exciting and charming as it sounds, but its participants see much more in park-our than that.\\nTo overcome all the obstacles on the course and in life is part of the philosophy behind park-our.

This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature.

Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye. A cell is normally transparent under a microscope, and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background. Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size, shape, internal and external components and its associations with other cells. The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well.

I was assigned a  random roommate for my 2-bedroom place 7 months ago, and am halfway  through the lease. I was randomly assigned a roommate, whom I contacted  about 2 weeks prior to moving in.

We still found countless topics to speak on. As a  roommate though, he seemed to be very neurotic about a few things. First  off, he was intent on dividing the entire space and creating some  ground rules. But his ground rules were strange and always changing. For  instance, he was very intent on splitting up kitchen counter space. But  I had no items on the counter at all and figured we could use the  countless cupboards. I said whatever, just like I kept saying, but shit  has gotten weird.\\n\\nHe has apparently had  terrible experiences with his family in the past, but he told me his  parents and sister blame their divorce on him. He talked of  physical/verbal/emotional abuse, the 1st of which he is suing his  parents for. Briefly put, his parents no longer speak to him and his  sister refuses to speak with him expect in therapy. They don't totally  believe he has Asperger's too. They sent him to psychiatric camps. He is  suing them for that too. He is poor because they won't supply him with  money due to his drug habit. reminded me of a kid I knew a few years  back who passed since.\\n\\nHe makes my place  smell weird because he is always burning strange things like herbs and  Myrrh on the stove. He kept a few bananas on \\"his\\" side of the kitchen  with psilocybin spores in them, cut open to allow sunlight and air in.  They made the apartment reek after two weeks, when I asked him to remove  them (which he did reluctantly). He did something similar with a  pumpkin in the oven shortly after. He keeps jars and bottles of  unidentifiable fermented liquids throughout his side of the kitchen.  They smell so weird. He often burns nuts and cooks weird things like  yogurt. He straight up left yogurt out and continued to eat it for a  couple weeks. He is always smoking the strangest smelling things.  Somethings I'll admit aren't terrible, like \\"Godu kola,\\" but some of it  is strange shit that he cooked.

This means that there is something about moving over a surface like a dryer, as compared to an ironing board, which heats things up faster. Lint balls are made with fabric and typically contain some kind of static electricity (static energy). Dryers use heat in order to get clothes less damp or wet by using hot air currents; thus they also generate static energy through friction between their rotating drums and laundry inside them. In comparison, ironing boards do not have such high temperatures nor do they move at similar speeds as a typical household dryer so we can infer that this would cause the generated heat from rolling across its surface to be lower than on"},{"source":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below.

It was under his tenure as master general that the sisters in the order were given official membership. Humbert was a great lover of languages, and encouraged linguistic studies among the Dominicans, primarily Arabic, because of the missionary work friars were pursuing amongst those led astray or forced to convert by Muslims in the Middle East. He also wanted his friars to reach excellence in their preaching, and this was his most lasting contribution to the order. The growth of the spirituality of young preachers was his first priority. He once cried to his students: \\"... consider how excellent this office [of preaching] is, because it is apostolic; how useful, because it is directly ordained for the salvation of souls; how perilous, because few have in them, or perform, what the office requires, for it is not without great danger ... , vol. xxv.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm.

It challenges the belief  that short-sightedness is caused by computer use, watching TV or reading in weak light.\\nThe Australian government researchers believe that the sunlight is good for people's eyes. They compared the vision  and habits of 100 seven-year-old children in Singapore and Australia. In all, 30% of the Singaporean children were short-sighted--this rate  was ten times higher than Australian children.\\nBoth groups spend a similar amount  of time reading, watching television and playing computer games. However the Singaporean children spent an average   of only half an hour a day outdoors--90 minutes less than the Australian children.\\nProfessor Ian Morgan, from the Australian Research Council's vision Centre, said, \\"Humans are naturally long-sighted, but when people begin to go to school and spend little or no time outdoors, the number of short-sighted people gets larger. We're also seeing more and more short-sighted children in cities all around the world and the main reason may be that city children spend less time outdoors.\\nDaylight can be hundreds of times brighter than indoor light. But why does playing outside  prevent us from becoming short-sighted?

As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver thaler coins in 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, the worldwide price of silver began to fall. This resulted in the U.S. Coinage Act (1873) which put the United States onto a de facto gold standard. Canada and History of Newfoundland and Labrador were already on the gold standard, and the result was that the value of the dollar in North America increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly Latin America and the Far East. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following the abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the Canadian dollar began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in 1944, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the U.S. dollar.

In the work reported here, neck domains of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR expressed in isolation are shown to form tetramers in the absence of the CRDs. Stability analysis indicates that interactions between the neck domains account fully for the stability of the tetrameric extracellular portions of the receptors. The neck domains are approximately 40% α-helical based on circular dichroism analysis. However, in contrast to other glycan-binding receptors in which fully helical neck regions are intimately associated with C-terminal C-type CRDs, the neck domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR act as autonomous tetramerization domains and the neck domains and CRDs are organized independently. Neck domains from polymorphic forms of DC-SIGNR that lack some of the repeat sequences show modestly reduced stability, but differences near the C-terminal end of the neck domains lead to significantly enhanced stability of DC-SIGNR tetramers compared to DC-SIGN.","target":"Autonomous Tetramerization Domains in the Glycan-binding Receptors DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR","rationale":"The title should describe the organization of neck domains and C-type carbohydrate recognition domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, which are glycan binding receptors.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French. However, the French lines never broke during their tactical retreat; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight. Late in the afternoon, a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle. A series of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the Austrian army, which fled chaotically over the Bormida River back to Alessandria, leaving behind 14,000 casualties.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities.

At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost.

Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester:\\nFrom hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ...\\nThe surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ...

Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away. After five years of friendship it's the least Walter deserves of me. One other thing. The package. It's still sitting there in my study. Mocking me. That's how it feels anyway.

The next day on April 3rd, there is a funeral for Walter where his wife Martha was upset about her husband's death.\\nBased on this timeline we can deduce that two days after learning about Walters' death, there was already an organized funeral for him held at some point during these two days .

Some of his most famous plays are Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth .He wrote thirty-seven plays in all. They are still popular today.\\nHe was born in 1564 in England. At school he liked watching plays. He decided to be an actor when he finished school at the age of fourteen. In 1582, he married a farmer's daughter. She was eight years older than he was. Their first child was a daughter .Later they had twins. In1585, Shakespeare left his hometown, Stratford-upon-Avon. His wife and children stayed behind .No one knows why he left or what he did between 1585 and 1592.\\nAt twenty-eight he moved to London and joined a theatre company which opened the Globe Theatre in 1599. He became an actor, and he also wrote plays. He usually acted in his own plays .He earned almost no money from his writing. But he made a lot of money from acting. With the money he bought a large house in his hometown.\\nAt the age of forty-nine, Shakespeare retired   and went to live in Stratford-upon-Avon. He died at the age of fifty-two.

Whereas hydrostatic pressure forces fluid out of the capillary, osmotic pressure draws fluid back in. Osmotic pressure is determined by osmotic concentration gradients, that is, the difference in the solute-to-water concentrations in the blood and tissue fluid. A region higher in solute concentration (and lower in water concentration) draws water across a semipermeable membrane from a region higher in water concentration (and lower in solute concentration). As we discuss osmotic pressure in blood and tissue fluid, it is important to recognize that the formed elements of blood do not contribute to osmotic concentration gradients. Rather, it is the plasma proteins that play the key role. Solutes also move across the capillary wall according to their concentration gradient, but overall, the concentrations should be similar and not have a significant impact on osmosis. Because of their large size and chemical structure, plasma proteins are not truly solutes, that is, they do not dissolve but are dispersed or suspended in their fluid medium, forming a colloid rather than a solution.\\n\\n\\nQ: Which type of pressure forces fluid out of the capillary?\\n\\n\\nA:","target":"hydrostatic","rationale":"From the context, we learn that both hydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure are at work.

Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asif Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad.

After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \\"a very agreeable day\\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \\"a perfect musician\\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1.

Gwen Moore of Wisconsin declared in a May 4, 2017 news release, \\"\\"being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault could be considered pre-existing conditions.\\"\\" The claim by Moore, who has talked publicly about being a victim of domestic violence and sexual assault herself, cuts to one of the big fears around health care -- that having something that is considered a pre-existing condition means a person has to pay more for insurance, or could be denied coverage altogether. Typically, this refers to things such as diabetes or cancer. But sexual assault or domestic violence? Obamacare vs ‘Trumpcare’ The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is the 2010 legislation adopted under President Barack Obama. It prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage -- or charging higher premiums -- because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Under the American Health Care Act (sometimes called \\"\\"Trumpcare\\"\\"), insurers would still be prohibited from denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition. The bill was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives and could be changed in the Senate. But in its current form, the bill would give states the option to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions higher prices. Republicans argue those people would be protected, because those states would have to set up high-risk pools to insure people with pre-existing conditions. But many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable. (The day after the House passed the bill, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said he would consider allowing insurers to charge higher prices. But later that day -- in an indication of how politically touchy the issue is -- he backed away from that comment after it drew criticism.) Pre-existing conditions Bloggers claimed that under the GOP bill, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition, which PolitiFact National rated . PolitiFact National spelled out what would happen under the GOP bill regarding sexual assault and experts told us that the same would apply to domestic violence. In a nutshell: The bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable. Our rating Moore says that \\"\\"under ‘Trumpcare,’\\"\\" the Republican replacement for Obamacare, domestic violence and sexual assault \\"\\"could be considered pre-existing conditions\\"\\" -- something that could trigger higher insurance prices for those victims. Moore’s claim goes too far. Simply being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault would not mean a person had a pre-existing condition. But it is important to know that conditions stemming from those assaults, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, could. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is .\\" Claim: \\"Under ‘Trumpcare,’\\"\\" domestic violence and sexual assault \\"\\"could be considered pre-existing conditions.\\"","target":"0","rationale":"In the given paragraph, the speaker is explaining how Obamacare prevented insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums because of a pre-existing medical condition. However, in Trumpcare states could allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions higher prices. This shows that although sexual assault and domestic violence alone cannot be considered as pre-existing conditions, but the individual can still be charged higher premiums if he has any medical condition stemming from sexual assault or domestic violence. Therefore, this claim contradicts what is stated in the paragraph and hence should be classified as '0'."},{"source":"The Giants' defense was trashed by the media during Week 4, their bye week, as they had allowed a whopping 92 points in their first three games, roughly 31 per game. After forcing a punt, the Giants drove to the Washington 29, but Jay Feely was wide left on a 47-yard attempt. Aided by a William Joseph roughing-the-passer penalty on 3rd-and-11 that would have forced a Washington punt, Mark Brunell drove the Redskins to the Giants' 21, where John Hall nailed a 39-yard field goal. Manning was unfazed, finding Amani Toomer on a 44-yard completion to move the ball to the Washington 10, and apparently finding him for a touchdown pass of 5 yards three plays later, but the score was nullified by a Jeremy Shockey pass-interference penalty. Feely knocked in a chip shot of 24 yards to tie the score, 3-3, early in the second quarter. Manning would again use the big play to help the Giants to their next score, finding Plaxico Burress on a 46-yard completion that gave the Giants the ball at the Redskins' 22. Soon after, Feely hit a 34-yard field goal to give the Giants their first lead since Week 2. After forcing a punt, Manning led the Giants on a 14-play, 84-yard drive, capped by a 32-yard field goal by Feely, his third of the quarter and half.

Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the early Permian time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today.  Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta.  This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color.  Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is 100 to 300 feet (30 to 90 m) thick. Manakacha (see 5b in figure 1) is a cliff- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages 300 feet (90 m) thick in Grand Canyon. Wescogame (see 5c in figure 1) is a ledge- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 100 to 200 feet (30 to 60 m) thick. Esplanade (see 5d in figure 1) is a ledge- and cliff-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 200 to 800 feet (60 to 200 m) thick. An unconformity marks the top of the Supai Group.","target":"early Permian","rationale":"The article states that the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico around this time, which was 320 million to 270 million years ago.

Rainfall is usually greater in the higher elevations of San Diego; some of the higher elevation areas of San Diego can receive 11–15 inches (280–380 mm) of rain a year. Variability of rainfall can be extreme: in the wettest years of 1883/1884 and 1940/1941 more than 24 inches (610 mm) fell in the city, whilst in the driest years as little as 3.2 inches (80 mm) has fallen for a full year.

It is part of the Lutheran branch of Christianity.\\n\\n- The Oulu Cathedral ( Finnish : Oulun tuomiokirkko ) is an Evangelical Lutheran cathedral and the seat of the Diocese of Oulu , located in the centre of Oulu , Finland . The church was built in 1777 as a tribute to the King of Sweden Gustav III of Sweden and named after his wife as Sofia Magdalena 's church . The wooden structures burned in the large fire of the city of Oulu in 1822 . The church was built again on top of the old stonewalls with famous architect Carl Ludvig Engel as the designer . The restoration works were completed in 1832 , but the belfry was not erected until 1845 .\\n\\n- The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.\\n\\n- A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.\\n\\n- A cathedra (Latin, \\"chair\\", from Greek,  \\"kathédra\\", \\"seat\\") or bishop's throne is the seat of a bishop. It is a symbol of the bishop's teaching authority in the Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion churches. \\"Cathedra\\" is the Latin word for a chair with armrests, and it appears in early Christian literature in the phrase \\"\\"cathedrae apostolorum\\"\\", indicating authority derived directly from the apostles; its Roman connotations of authority reserved for the Emperor were later adopted by bishops after the 4th century. A church into which a bishop's official \\"cathedra\\" is installed is called a cathedral.\\n\\n- The Diocese of Oulu is a diocese within the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. The diocese was first founded in the town of Kuopio in 1851, but the episcopal see was moved to Oulu in 1900.\\n\\n- The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.\\n\\n- Gustav III ( 29 March 1792) was King of Sweden from 1771 until his assassination in 1792. He was the eldest son of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Queen Louise Ulrika (a sister of King Frederick the Great of Prussia), and a first cousin of Empress Catherine the Great of Russia by reason of their common descent from Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin, and his wife Albertina Frederica of Baden-Durlach.\\n\\n- A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).\\n\\n- Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp-Eutin (11 January 1673  24 April 1726) was a cadet of the reigning ducal House of Holstein-Gottorp who became prince of Eutin, prince-bishop of Lübeck and regent of the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp.\\n\\n- Duomo is a term for an Italian cathedral church.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.\\n\\n- Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million.\\n\\n- Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism.\\n\\n- Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a \\"transitional\\" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe.\\n\\n- A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile.\\n\\n- Bosnia and Herzegovina (or ; B&H; Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: \\"Bosna i Hercegovina\\" / a   ), sometimes called Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH), and, in short, often known informally as Bosnia, is a country in Southeastern Europe located on the Balkan Peninsula. Sarajevo is the capital and largest city. Bordered by Croatia to the north, west, and south; Serbia to the east; Montenegro to the southeast; and the Adriatic Sea to the south, with a coastline about long surrounding the city of Neum. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland is a geographically larger region and has a moderate continental climate, with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a Mediterranean climate and plain topography.\\n\\n- A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.\\n\\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\\n\\n- Montenegro (or or ; Montenegrin: \\"Crna Gora\\" /   , meaning \\"Black Mountain\\") is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\").\\n\\n- The aftermath of World War II was the beginning of an era defined by the decline of the old great powers and the rise of two superpowers: the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States of America (USA), creating a bipolar world. Allied during World War II, the USA and the USSR became competitors on the world stage and engaged in what became known as the Cold War, so called because it never boiled over into open war between the two powers but was focused on espionage, political subversion and proxy wars. Western Europe and Japan were rebuilt through the American Marshall Plan whereas Eastern Europe fell in the Soviet sphere of influence and rejected the plan. Europe was divided into a US-led Western Bloc and a Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. Internationally, alliances with the two blocs gradually shifted, with some nations trying to stay out of the Cold War through the Non-Aligned Movement. The Cold War also saw a nuclear arms race between the two superpowers; some argue part of the reason that the Cold War never became a \\"hot\\" war was that the Soviet Union and the United States had nuclear deterrents against each other, leading to a mutually assured destruction standoff.\\n\\n- The Yugoslav Wars were a series of ethnically-based wars and insurgencies fought from 1991 to 2001 inside the territory of the former Yugoslavia. These wars accompanied and/or facilitated the breakup of the Yugoslav state, when its constituent republics declared independence, but the issues of ethnic minorities in the new countries (chiefly Serbs, Croats and Albanians) were still unresolved at the time the republics were recognized internationally. The wars are generally considered to be a series of separate but related military conflicts which occurred in, and affected, most of the former Yugoslav republics.\\n\\n- Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana.\\n\\n- The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFR Yugoslavia or SFRY) was the Yugoslav state that existed from its foundation in the aftermath of World War II until its dissolution in 1991 amid the Yugoslav Wars. It was a socialist state and a federation made up of six socialist republics: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia. In addition, it included two autonomous provinces within Serbia: Kosovo and Vojvodina.\\n\\n- Kosovo  is a disputed territory and partially recognised state in Southeast Europe that declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 as the Republic of Kosovo. Kosovo is landlocked in the central Balkan Peninsula. Its capital and largest city is Pristina. It is bordered by the Republic of Macedonia and Albania to the south, Montenegro to the west, and the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east. While Serbia recognises administration of the territory by Kosovo's elected government, it still continues to claim it as its own Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.\\n\\n- Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora.\\n\\n- The Croatian War of Independence was fought from 1991 to 1995 between Croat forces loyal to the government of Croatia -- which had declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) -- and the Serb - controlled Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) and local Serb forces , with the JNA ending its combat operations in Croatia by 1992 . In Croatia , the war is primarily referred to as the Homeland War ( Domovinski rat ) and also as the Greater - Serbian aggression ( Velikosrpska agresija ) . In Serbian sources , War in Croatia ( Rat u Hrvatskoj ) is the most commonly used public term . A majority of Croats wanted Croatia to leave Yugoslavia and become a sovereign country , while many ethnic Serbs living in Croatia , supported by Serbia , opposed the secession and wanted Croatia to remain a part of Yugoslavia . Most Serbs effectively sought a new Serb state within a Yugoslav federation , including areas of Croatia and Bosnia - Herzegovina with ethnic Serb majorities or significant minorities , and attempted to conquer as much of Croatia as possible . In 2007 , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) returned a guilty verdict against Milan Marti , one of the Serb leaders in Croatia , for having colluded with Slobodan Miloševi and others to create a \`\` unified Serbian state '' . Between 2008 and 2012 , the ICTY had prosecuted Croatian generals Ante Gotovina , Mladen Marka and Ivan ermak for alleged involvement in the crimes related to Operation Storm . ermak was acquitted outright , and the convictions of Gotovina and Marka were later overturned by an ICTY Appeals Panel . The International Court of Justice dismissed Croatia and Serbia genocide claims in 2015 . While it reaffirmed that serious crimes against civilians were committed by both sides and that these acts constitute some basic elements of genocide , it ruled that the genocidal intent was not present .

For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged. Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is—in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention. Lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transsexual youth face much discrimination through bullying from those unlike them and may find telling others that they are gay to be a traumatic experience.

Classical Palmyra had a distinctive culture, based on a local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome. To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or in addition to a second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a \\"boule\\" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.\\nThe culture of Persia influenced Palmyrene military tactics, dress and court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern cities such as Edessa or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was Cassius Longinus.Palmyra had a large agora. However, unlike the Greek Agoras (public gathering places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used in some of the tombs.

The first effects of nicotine withdrawal will be felt within 6 hours of having your last cigarette. However the peak time for these nicotine withdrawal side effects will be the second and third day post-smoking cessation. From then on depending on the factors I mentioned earlier on, nicotine withdrawal will begin to diminish over a 2 – 3 week period. So in effect, you could say on average that nicotine withdrawal will last about 3 weeks. However, it could be shorter in some people and in heavy smokers who have smoked for 20 years or longer, the nicotine withdrawal could last for up to 2 months. So you now have a rough idea of how long nicotine withdrawal does last. Most people will fall in between those withdrawal timelines. Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed. 1  Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. 2  Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Nicotine is a chemical compound that is present in tobacco. When tobacco is smoked, nicotine is absorbed through the wall lining of the small air sacs in the lungs. While by sniffing or chewing tobacco, it is absorbed through the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth. It can: 1  Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking. 2  Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression. 3  Increase activity in the intestines. 4  Create more saliva and phlegm. 5  Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute. Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later.

In this study, the two diagnostic assays that targeted respectively on Mp-antibody and Mp-DNA were retrospectively investigated. Methods: A total of 3146 children were clinically diagnosed to have CAP and were confirmed by chest X-ray during March 2015 to February 2016 in Children's hospital of Hebei Province (China). Both of the sera and sputum samples were collected in 24 h after their admission. The Mp-antibody was examined by the passive particle agglutination assay and a fourfold or greater increase of antibody titers of paired sera or≧1:160 titer of single serum was set as the serology positive. Mp-DNA in the sputum samples was tested by a multiplex-PCR method named GeXP assay (multiplex PCR combined with automated capillary electrophoresis). In order to eliminate the false positive results caused by the asymptomatic carriage after infected by M. pneumoniae, the inconsistent samples were tested by the real-time isothermal transcription-mediated RNA amplification assay (SAT). The inter-rated agreement test was performed in 3146 CAP patients, with a highest kappa value in the schoolage children as 0.783. There were 6.29% (198/3146) cases showed inconsistent results determined by GeXP and serology assay. All of the 19 GeXP(+)/Serology (−) samples and a randomly chosen 27 from 179 GeXP(−)/Serology (+) samples were tested by SAT assay, and a 97.8% diagnosis agreement was observed between SAT and GeXP assay, but not with the serology assay. In addition, patients who were detected only by serology or only by multiplex-PCR were significantly younger than those with both methods positive (3.0 and 1.5 years vs. 5.0 years, p < 0. 01). The Viral-Mp coinfection accounted for 37.0% (97/262), which was more common in winter and spring (p < 0.05) and in the infantile group (p < 0.01), compared to the pure Mp positive ones. In some children CAP cases, the Mp laboratory diagnosis was inconsistent between serology and multiplex-PCR assay. Verified by the SAT assay, the GeXP showed a more sensitive and reliable performance compared with the serology assay. Furthermore, employing the multiplex-PCR could provide more information on the associated pathogens for clinical assessment of CAP.","target":"A comparison study between GeXP-based multiplex-PCR and serology assay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection in children with community acquired pneumonia","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of serology and GeXP-based multiplex-PCR assay in children with community acquired pneumonia.

After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloe, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century.\\n\\nMonteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saens's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saens judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui - Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.  Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes ecoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.  Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.\\n\\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What orchestra was it with?","target":"of Saint-Saens's oratorio La lyre et la harpe,","rationale":"The answer is \\"of Saint-Saens's oratorio La lyre et la harpe,\\", which occurs in the first paragraph of the article."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a text from a social media post.

The band has said embarking on their first live tour instead of recording an album initially helped them develop their style and sound. As Pritchard claimed, \\"We didn't sit down with a blueprint. We just naturally developed and we didn't try to shape or mould ourselves to anything.\\" As a result, they went into the studio with hundreds of songs from a variety of genres, and it took an \\"incredible amount of patience\\" from producer Tony Hoffer to shape the content into what would become the record.  Following their first tour supporting the Thrills, the Kooks recorded their debut album, Inside In/Inside Out, at Konk studios in London in 2005. Though media attention was dominated by the release of the Arctic Monkeys debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not on the same day, Inside In/Inside Out recorded first week sales of 19,098. Later, speaking to NME, Pritchard would thank the Arctic Monkeys for \\"shielding\\" The Kooks from the press' scrutiny. \\"God bless the Arctic Monkeys because if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have been so shielded. We were so overshadowed by the success [of Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not] because it was so monster and we crept in behind everybody's back.\\" Entering the UK Albums Chart at number nine, it would eventually peak at number 2 for two weeks. Singles \\"Eddie's Gun\\", \\"Sofa Song\\", \\"You Don't Love Me\\", \\"Naive\\", \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\" and \\"Ooh La\\" achieved chart success in the UK and Europe, while \\"Naive\\" and \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\" put The Kooks in the top ten for the first time.  Kev Kharas, in his review for Drowned in Sound, viewed the Kooks as \\"a less irreverent and more melodic Art Brut, swapping that band's caustic wit for a far nicer type of honesty.\\" Kharas also noted traces of \\"emo\\" in the band's style. AllMusic's Tim Sendra noted that the band's direction was \\"heavily indebted to classic rock\\", in particular Thin Lizzy and the Dexys, ultimately though Sendra felt \\"the band sounds like the Kooks and no one else\\". Calling the Kooks \\"an important reminder that there are just as many mediocre bands in the UK as there are in the United States\\" reviewer Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone claimed the album was \\"utterly forgettable, shoddily produced retro rock that at its worst sounds like a Brighton-accented version of the Spin Doctors\\". Brian Belardi of Prefix gave a positive review, describing Inside In/Inside Out as \\"An almost-perfect blend of '60s-style Britpop, '90s-style Britpop, and the post-punk of the new millennium\\".  The album went on to be certified quadruple platinum in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) within a year and certified platinum across Europe by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).

Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which strictly measures change in probability, the Wasserstein metric reflects the underlying geometry between outcomes. The value of being sensitive to this geometry has been demonstrated, among others, in ordinal regression and generative modelling, and most recently in reinforcement learning. In this paper we describe three natural properties of probability divergences that we believe reflect requirements from machine learning: sum invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients. The Wasserstein metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, does not possess the third. We provide empirical evidence suggesting this is a serious issue in practice. Leveraging insights from probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric, the Cramér distance. We show that the Cramér distance possesses all three desired properties, combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler divergences. We give empirical results on a number of domains comparing these three divergences. To illustrate the practical relevance of the Cramér distance we design a new algorithm, the Cramér Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and show that it has a number of desirable properties over the related Wasserstein GAN.","target":"The Wasserstein distance is hard to minimize with stochastic gradient descent, while the Cramer distance can be optimized easily and works just as well","rationale":"Here's a brief summary:\\\\nThe Wasserstein distance is hard to minimize with stochastic gradient descent, while the Cramer distance can be optimized easily and works just as well"},{"source":"The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements.

Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth brought many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: \\"I'll never believe that a man who understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about.\\"The success put Shostakovich in good standing once again.

In a newspaper article published under Shostakovich's name, the Fifth Symphony was characterized as \\"A Soviet artist's creative response to just criticism.\\" The composer Dmitry Kabalevsky, who had been among those who disassociated themselves from Shostakovich when the Pravda article was published, praised the Fifth Symphony and congratulated Shostakovich for \\"not having given in to the seductive temptations of his previous 'erroneous' ways.\\"It was also at this time that Shostakovich composed the first of his string quartets.

Women were systematically assigned to receive an advance provision of emergency contraception and education (treatment) or education only (control). Among 263 participants enrolled (133 treatment, 130 control), follow-up was completed in 213 (111 treatment, 102 control). The main outcome measures were emergency contraception knowledge and use, frequency of unprotected sex, and pattern of contraceptive use in the past 4 months.   \\n RESULTS Participants were aware of emergency contraception at follow-up, but the treatment group was three times as likely to use it (P =.006). Although the treatment group did not report higher frequencies of unprotected sex than the control group, women in the treatment group (28%) were more likely than those in the control group (17%) to report using less effective contraception at follow-up compared with enrollment (P =.05). The proportion of women in both groups who reported consistent pill use increased from enrollment to follow-up (34% versus 45%); however, the control group (58%) was more likely than the treatment group (32%) to report consistent pill use at follow-up (P =.03).   \\n CONCLUSION Use of emergency contraception was increased by providing it in advance, but not by education alone.

ET pigs were placed on a progressive treadmill training program lasting 16 to 20 weeks, and SED pigs remained inactive during the same time period. Coronary resistance arteries 64 to 157 microns in diameter were isolated for in vitro evaluation of relaxation responses to the endothelium-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside (1 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-4) mol/L) and adenosine (1 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-5) mol/L) and to bradykinin (1 x 10(-13) to 3 x 10(-7) mol/L), an endothelium-dependent agent. Relaxation responses to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were not altered by exercise training. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin was enhanced in coronary resistance arteries from ET pigs (IC50: ET, 0.07 +/- 0.02 nmol/L; SED, 1.59 +/- 0.09 nmol/L). To determine whether prostanoids and/or the nitric oxide synthase pathway were involved in the ET-induced changes in bradykinin-induced vasodilation, responses to bradykinin were examined in coronary resistance arteries from both ET and SED pigs in the presence of indomethacin and in the presence of nitro-monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA). Both indomethacin and L-NMMA produced significant inhibition of the bradykinin-induced relaxation in vessels from both groups. Despite decreased bradykinin-induced relaxation after indomethacin, bradykinin-induced vasodilation was still enhanced in vessels from the ET group. L-NMMA caused greater inhibition of the bradykinin-induced relaxation in coronary resistance arteries from ET pigs relative to arteries from SED pigs and eliminated the training-induced enhancement of the bradykinin responses.   \\n CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that exercise training enhances bradykinin-induced vasodilation through increased endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide production by the L-arginine/nitric oxide synthase pathway.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the purpose of the study (\\"BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that vasodilator responses of porcine coronary resistance arteries are increased by exercise training.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe how various experiments were performed and what results were obtained, and a closing sentence that summarizes main findings from these experiments.

Resting VO2 was measured via indirect calorimetry in the fasted state. Submaximal VO2 and VO2max were determined during an all out, progressive treadmill exercise test appropriate for children. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to determine total fat mass (FM), soft lean tissue mass (LTM), and leg soft LTM. Doubly labeled water was used to determine total energy expenditure (TEE) and activity energy expenditure (AEE). A significant effect of ethnicity (P < 0.01) was found for VO2max but not resting or submaximal VO2, with African-American children having absolute VO2max approximately 15% lower than Caucasian children (1.21 +/- 0.032 vs. 1.43 +/- 0.031 l/min, respectively). The lower VO2max persisted in African-American children after adjustment for soft LTM (1.23 +/- 0.025 vs. 1.39 +/- 0.031 l/min; P < 0.01), leg soft LTM (1.20 +/- 0.031 vs. 1.43 +/- 0.042 l/min; P < 0.01), and soft LTM and FM (1.23 +/- 0.025 vs. 1.39 +/- 0.031 l/min; P < 0.01). The lower VO2max persisted also after adjustment for TEE (1.20 +/- 0.02 vs. 1.38 +/- 0.0028 l/min P < 0.001) and AEE (1.20 +/- 0.024 vs. 1.38 +/- 0.028 l/min; P < 0.001). In conclusion, our data indicate that African-American and Caucasian children have similar rates of VO2 at rest and during submaximal exercise, but VO2max is approximately 15% lower in African-American children, independent of soft LTM, FM, leg LTM, TEE, and AEE.","target":"False","rationale":"This abstract lacks a topic sentence, relevant supporting sentences, or a closing sentence.

While historians have traditionally suggested that his parents sent him to Lake Forest to discourage his interest in jazz, others believe that he may have been sent away in response to his arrest. Regardless, Mr. and Mrs. Beiderbecke apparently felt that a boarding school would provide their son with both the faculty attention and discipline required to improve his academic performance, necessitated by the fact that Bix had failed most courses at High School, remaining a junior in 1921 despite turning 18 in March of that year. His interests, however, remained limited to music and sports. In pursuit of the former, Beiderbecke often visited Chicago to listen to jazz bands at night clubs and speakeasies, including the infamous Friar's Inn, where he sometimes sat in with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. He also traveled to the predominantly African-American South Side to listen to classic black jazz bands such as King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, which featured Louis Armstrong on second cornet. \\"Don't think I'm getting hard, Burnie,\\" he wrote to his brother, \\"but I'd go to hell to hear a good band.\\" On campus, he helped organize the Cy-Bix Orchestra with drummer Walter \\"Cy\\" Welge and almost immediately got into trouble with the Lake Forest headmaster for performing indecorously at a school dance.\\nBeiderbecke often failed to return to his dormitory before curfew, and sometimes stayed off-campus the next day.

After being incorporated into the Sui dynasty, its economic richness was used for the Sui dynasty's ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into Korea and Vietnam. The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay), and from Suzhou, and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's Jiangnan East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous.

Emergency department (ED) clinicians are at high risk of exposure to both these and common communicable diseases. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended to protect clinicians from acquiring, or becoming vectors of, infection, yet compliance is typically sub-optimal. Little is known about factors that influence use of PPE-specifically gloves and masks-during routine care in the ED. Methods: This was an ethnographic study, incorporating documentation review, field observations and interviews. The theoretical domains framework (TDF) was used to aid thematic analysis and identify relevant enablers of and barriers to optimal PPE use. Results: Thirty-one behavioural themes were identified that influenced participants' use of masks and gloves. There were significant differences, namely: more reported enablers of glove use vs more barriers to mask use. Reasons included more positive unit culture towards glove use, and lower perception of risk via facial contamination. Conclusion: Emerging infectious diseases, spread (among other routes) by respiratory droplets, have caused global outbreaks. Emergency clinicians should ensure that, as with gloves, the use of masks is incorporated into routine cares where appropriate. Further research which examines items of PPE independently is warranted. (R. Barratt). severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and pandemic influenza A [2]. Healthcareassociated transmission of these viral infections, into previously unaffected communities, was a key feature of the early stages of, for example, SARS in Toronto and MERS in Seoul [3, 4] . A notable feature of both outbreaks was the high proportion of those affected who were healthcare workers, with reports of up to 27% and 57% for MERS and SARS, respectively [5] .

Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved.\\nWhen my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

Following their 3-1 start to the season, the Bengals had lost all momentum and fallen heavily in the AFC standings.Despite being heavy underdogs, the Bengals came out and grabbed the momentum of the football game early, scoring on their first possession of the game. Playing against a defense that Cincinnati receiver AJ Green remarked \\" a lot of holes,\\" earlier in the week, Green culminated Cincinnati's first possession with a fifty-six yard touchdown reception, beating a badly blown coverage on the play. The score marked Green's eighth straight contest with a touchdown reception, which tied him with former Bengal TJ Houshmandzadeh for second all-time in Bengals history.The ensuing Giants possession was unspectacular, with the Giants going three-and-out and being forced to punt the ball right back to Cincinnati. New York Giant punter Sean Weatherford looked to have gotten a spectacular punt away, which would have forced Cincinnati to start their possession inside their own twenty yard-line. However, a penalty on Giants cornerback Justin Tryon for intentionally leaving the field of play, rendered the punt moot, and forced the Giants to re-attempt the play. On the ensuing punt, Bengals cornerback Adam \\"Pacman\\" Jones returned the ball sixty-eight yards to the Giants eleven yard line. The Bengals did not hesitate to take advantage of the large swing in field positioning, as second year quarterback Andy Dalton connected with receiver Andrew Hawkins for an eleven-yard touchdown strike on third-and-ten. The three play drive took only eighteen second off of the clock, and gave the Bengals a 14-0 advantage. The Giants would see a measure of momentum swing in their favor as following their ensuing possession, which resulted in a three-and-out from New York, Cincinnati receiver Brandon Tate would fumble Sean Weatherford's punt, giving the Giants possession of the football inside Cincinnati territory for the first time on the afternoon. The Giants would somewhat take advantage of the mistake, as they would turn the fumble into a twenty-three yard field goal by placekicker Lawrence Tynes. After both teams traded punts, the Bengals would proceed to expand their lead further, putting together a fifteen play drive that took over seven minutes off of the clock and resulted in a twenty-eight yard field goal by Mike Nugent. The conversion put Cincinnati up by a score of 17-3 with time dwindling in the first half. The ensuing Giants possession would take all but eleven second of the 4:17 that remained in the opening half and would see Lawrence Tynes trotted out to convert on a thirty-one yard field goal at its finish. The points got the Giants back to within eleven points at the half, with the score 17-6 in favour of Cincinnati.The first five possessions coming out of the half, two of which ended in New York Giant turnovers, would not result in any points being scored by either team. However, following an Eli Manning interception, Cincinnati would be able to take advantage of the short field and pick up their third touchdown on the afternoon. The Bengals second three-play touchdown drive of the game was capped off by Andy Dalton hitting tight end Jermaine Gresham for a ten-yard receiving touchdown, making the score 24-6 in favour of Cincinnati.New York's next possession would result in Eli Manning firing a second straight interception. The result for Cincinnati would be the same, with Dalton culminating yet another three-play touchdown drive by hitting first-year receiver Mohamed Sanu for a ten-yard strike. The touchdown was Sanu's first receiving touchdown in the National Football League, though he had already thrown for a touchdown in Cincinnati's week 3 encounter with the Washington Redskins. The touchdown, also representing a career-high fourth on the afternoon for Andy Dalton, gave the Bengals their final points of the afternoon, and a 31-6 advantage.The rest of the game was largely uneventful, with both teams accepting the fate of the game as having already been determined. The Giants were able to put up their lone touchdown of the game following a thirteen play, ninety-eight yard possession that was capped by running back Ahmad Bradshaw punching the ball in from two yards away. The lone Giants touchdown of the afternoon would also be the last points put up, making the final score 31-13 Cincinnati. With the victory, the Bengals snapped their previous four game losing streak and improved their record to 4-5 on the season.

That night, the deadly tiger Shere Khan attacks the encampment, intent on killing a trio of soldiers who had been shooting several animals for fun in the jungle earlier, which had enraged him. He kills the first two hunters, but when he tries to kill the third hunter, Buldeo, Nathoo defends Buldeo, who ungratefully leaves him to be mauled to death by the tiger. In the confusion, Mowgli is lost in the jungle with his pet wolf cub, Grey Brother. Brydon and his men believe Mowgli has been killed too. Mowgli is taken by Bagheera, a gentle black panther, to the wolf pack. Mowgli also befriends a bear cub named Baloo.\\nYears later, Mowgli, now a young man, discovers Monkey City, a legendary ancient city filled with treasure belonging to King Louie the Orangutan, who has his treasure guarded by Kaa the python. Forced to fight for his life, Mowgli succeeds in wounding the snake with a golden dagger that he retrieves from the treasure horde. Winning King Louie's respect, Mowgli keeps the dagger as a trophy. Elsewhere, Katherine and her father are still stationed in India. She and Mowgli meet again, but neither recognize the other. Katherine is also in a relationship with one of Brydon's soldiers, William Boone. Mowgli enters the village in search of Katherine. Boone and his men manage to capture him and find the golden dagger from Monkey City in his possession. Katherine discovers an old bracelet of her mother's; one she gave to Mowgli when they were children, and instantly realizes who Mowgli is.

Hence, it is impossible to mathematically describe, accurately and completely, a real social contact network. To create a representative synthetic contact network and to simulate a possible infectious disease outbreak based on the network, we adopt a few simplifications. We separated population and indoor environments into representative groups and assumed that individuals in the same group share similar location visiting behaviors, and all of the indoor environments in the same group share similar characteristics such as the number of occupants, occupant density, and ventilation rate. Internal variations within each group can be simulated by assuming the possible distributions for different parameters. Visiting time The complex patterns of individuals arriving at and leaving a location are not considered. We simplified the scenario by dividing each indoor environment into different sub-visiting locations that represent different time durations for visiting each indoor environment. Thus, several locations may represent the same indoor environment at a different time. Therefore this approach differentiates individuals who visit the same indoor environment at different times. We also assumed that individuals who choose to visit a location (an indoor environment for a fixed duration) come at the same time and leave at the same time. Hence, the visiting time of all possible visitors to a given location is the same. We assumed that all of the individuals in a population group have the same location visiting schedule on weekdays. During a normal weekday, an individual may visit several locations in different location groups with a fixed order. To simulate the variations in an individual's daily choices, we assumed that for each step of an individual's schedule, he or she has a collection of favorite locations. Random contact is not considered in this model. \\n Title: Supplementary Information for Building ventilation as an effective disease intervention strategy in a dense indoor contact network in an ideal city","target":"True","rationale":"The title gives an overview of the study, which focuses on building ventilation as a possible strategy for controlling infectious diseases in an urban setting.

It was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The groundhog is also referred to as a chuck, wood-shock, groundpig, whistlepig, whistler, thickwood badger, Canada marmot, monax, moonack, weenusk, red monk and, among French Canadians in eastern Canada, siffleux. The name \`\`thickwood badger'' was given in the Northwest to distinguish the animal from the prairie badger. Monax was a Native American name of the woodchuck, which meant \`\`the digger''. Young groundhogs may be called chucklings. Other marmots, such as the yellow-bellied and hoary marmots, live in rocky and mountainous areas, but the groundhog is a lowland creature.

The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born.\\nThe Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour.

It was associated with the Hungarian Kingdom within the dual Austro-Hungarian state, being within the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen or Transleithania. The kingdom was ruled by the Habsburg Emperor-King of Austria-Hungary (\\"Kaiser und König\\") under his title as \\"King of Croatia and Slavonia\\". The King's appointed steward was the Ban of Croatia and Slavonia. In 1918, the kingdom declared independence and reformed into the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.\\n\\n- The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy in Central Europe that existed from the Middle Ages into the twentieth century (10001946 with the exception of 19181920). The Principality of Hungary emerged as a Christian kingdom upon the coronation of the first king Stephen I at Esztergom in about the year 1000; his family (the Árpád dynasty) led the monarchy for 300 years. By the 12th century, the kingdom became a European middle power within the Western world.\\n\\n- The official name \\"Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen\\" denominated the Hungarian territories of Austria-Hungary during the totality of the existence of the latter, from 30 March 1867 - 16 November 1918. This union of polities is sometimes denominated \\"\\" (\\"Arch-Kingdom of Hungary\\"), pursuant to Medieval Latin terminology. Pursuant to Article 1 of the CroatianHungarian Settlement of 1868, this territory was officially defined as \\"a state union of Kingdom of Hungary and Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia.\\" The Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen disintegrated with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary.\\n\\n- CroatianHungarian Settlement was a pact signed in 1868, that governed Croatia's political status in the Hungarian-ruled part of Austria-Hungary. It lasted until the end of World War I, when the Croatian Parliament, as the representative of the historical sovereignty of Croatia, on October 29, 1918 adopted a decision on the cessation of all state and legal ties with the old Austria-Hungary.\\n\\n- The 9 cm Minenwerfer M 14 ( Trench mortar ) was a light mortar used by Austria - Hungary in World War I. It was designed by the Army 's own Technisches und Administratives Militär - Komitee ( TMK ) in an effort to quickly satisfy the demand from the front for a light mortar . It had a number of issues with its ammunition , namely the black powder used as a propellant gave off copious smoke clouds on firing that revealed the tube 's location and the mortar bomb fuzes had a high rate of failure . The breech - loading mortar tube was mounted on a framework that did n't allow for any traverse , which meant that it was impossible to engage different targets without relaying the mortar . In turn the frame was mounted a rectangular firing platform . The M 14/16 had a circular platform to provide traverse and weighed only 65 kilograms ( 143 lb ) . A later model allowed the mounting to be collapsed for ease of transport . A new M 16 mortar bomb that used the German Poppenberg fuze system generally cured the dud problem , but it still used black powder as its propellant . This was a severe tactical disadvantage and it was decided to purchase replacement mortars from the German firm of Heinrich Lanz from 1917 .\\n\\n- Cisleithania (also \\"Zisleithanien\\", , , , , , , , , transliterated: \\"Tsysleitàniia\\") was a common yet unofficial denotation of the northern and western part of Austria-Hungary, the Dual Monarchy created in the Compromise of 1867as distinguished from \\"Transleithania\\", i.e. the Hungarian Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen east of (\\"beyond\\") the Leitha River.\\n\\n- World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.\\n\\n- The Habsburg Monarchy or Empire, occasionally also styled as the Danubian Monarchy (\\"Donaumonarchie\\"), is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918. The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\\n\\n- The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.\\n\\n- The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, \\"alias\\" Composition of 1867, established the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The Compromise re-established partially the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hungary, separate from, and no longer subject to the Austrian Empire. Under the Compromise, the lands of the House of Habsburg were reorganized as a real union between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Cisleithanian (Austrian) and Transleithanian (Hungarian) regions of the state were governed by separate parliaments and prime ministers. Unity was maintained through rule of a single head of state, reigning as both the Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, and common monarchy-wide ministries of foreign affairs, defence and finance under his direct authority. The armed forces were combined with the Emperor-King as commander-in-chief.\\n\\n- Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council, or \\"Cisleithania\\") and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or \\"Transleithania\\") that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I. The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'service entry' with the subject '9 cm minenwerfer m 14'.\\n\\nChoices:\\n- 1780\\n - 1806\\n - 1867\\n - 1868\\n - 1914\\n - 1918\\n - 1920\\n - 1946","target":"1914","rationale":"The 9 cm Minenwerfer M 14 (Trench mortar) was a light mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I.

Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt.\\nNorthup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \\"Platt\\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner William Ford.

He played as a midfielder for Sporting CP, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Internazionale before retiring on 31 May 2009. He won 127 caps for the Portugal national team, a record at the time but later broken by Cristiano Ronaldo. Renowned for his creativity and ability to get past defenders as a winger, Figo is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.\\n\\nOn 18 February 2004, Figo earned his 100th cap in a 1-1 friendly draw with England at the Estadio Algarve, playing as captain despite regular skipper Fernando Couto being in the starting line-up. Later that year at the European Championship on home soil, he captained the side after Couto was dropped. He announced his retirement from international football following the Euro 2004 final upset-defeat by Greece due to an elleged rift between him and national coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, although this was denied. In June 2005, he reversed his decision and returned for the 2006 World Cup qualifying wins against Slovakia and Estonia under Scolari.  Figo captained the squad during the 2006 World Cup, leading the team to the semi-finals. With three wins, Portugal finished top of their group and qualified for the knock-out rounds with Mexico. They advanced past the Netherlands in the last 16, and defeated England on penalties in the quarter-final. Figo did not take part in the shootout, having been substituted for Helder Postiga. In the semi-final, Portugal were beaten by France courtesy of a penalty from his former club-mate and French captain Zinedine Zidane. This was Portugal's best finish in 40 years. The third place playoff caused some controversy as Figo did not start; Pauleta captained the team in his place. However, Portugal fell behind 2-0 to hosts Germany and Figo replaced Pauleta in the 77th minute, who handed him back the captain's armband to cheers from both Portuguese and German fans. Although Germany scored another goal shortly after Figo's entrance, he ended his final cap for his country on a high note by setting up Nuno Gomes to head in an 88th-minute consolation goal, thus passing his number 7 jersey down to his successor, Cristiano Ronaldo.  Despite having no trophies to show for the \\"Golden Generation,\\" Figo managed to captain the team to their best World Cup performance since the Eusebio era in 1966, as well as helping Portugal to their best-ever result in the UEFA European Championship until they won it in 2016. He finished his international career with 127 caps and scoring 32 goals, and held the record until June 2016 for most appearances with the Portugal national team; he is also Portugal's fourth-highest all time goalscorer.\\n\\nWhat was the feeling after losing?","target":"he ended his final cap for his country on a high note","rationale":"The context states that despite having no trophies to show for the \\"\\"Golden Generation\\"\\", Figo managed to captain the team to their best World Cup performance since the Eusebio era in 1966.

As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage.\\nBorn and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \\"Our Song\\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner.\\nSwift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \\"Mean\\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\". For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. Its singles \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Blank Space\\", and \\"Bad Blood\\" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\" topped the UK and US charts; with the former, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US.\\nSwift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 50 million albums—including 27.8 million in the US—and 150 million single downloads.

Like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, altocumulus signifies convection. It is usually white or grey, and often occurs in sheets or patches with wavy, rounded masses or rolls. A sheet of partially conjoined altocumulus perlucidus is sometimes found preceding a weakening warm front, where the altostratus is starting to fragment, resulting in patches of altocumulus perlucidus between the areas of altostratus. Altocumulus is also commonly found between the warm and cold fronts in a depression, although this is often hidden by lower clouds.

Fog tends to only appear at a moderate temperatures because fog needs warm rising moist air; this happens often early in the morning on cool days with no wind.

During the Hussite Wars and the following decades, the castle was not inhabited. In 1485, King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuild the castle. The massive Vladislav Hall  was added to the Royal Palace. New defence towers were also built on the north side of the castle. A large fire in 1541 destroyed large parts of the castle. Under the Habsburgs, some new buildings in Renaissance style were added. Ferdinand I built the Belvedere as a summer palace for his wife Anne. Rudolph II used Prague Castle as his main residence. He founded the northern wing of the palace, with the Spanish Hall, where his precious art collections were exhibited. The Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618 took place at the castle and began the Bohemian Revolt. During the subsequent wars, the Castle was damaged and dilapidated. Many works from  the collection of Rudolph II were looted by Swedes in 1648, in the Battle of Prague  which was the final act of the Thirty Years' War. The last major rebuilding of the castle was carried out by Empress Maria Theresa in the second half of the 18th century.

The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e. including translations, is known as the Poincaré group.

During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg. The assertion of Métis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba. There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province.\\nManitoba's capital and largest city, Winnipeg, is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada.

The seamount rises for 4,420 metres (14,500 ft) to 1,335 metres (4,380 ft) depth and is formed by basaltic rocks.

The Macdonald, Rarotonga, Rurutu and Society hotspots may have been involved in its formation. The first volcanic phase took place in the Cenomanian and was followed by the formation of a carbonate platform that quickly disappeared below the sea. A second volcanic episode between 85 and 78.4 million years ago (in the Campanian) led to the formation of an island. This island was eventually eroded and rudist reefs generated an atoll or atoll-like structure, covering the former island with carbonates and thus a second carbonate platform.\\nThe second carbonate platform drowned about 68 million years ago (in the Maastrichtian), perhaps because at that time it was moving through the equatorial area which may have been too hot or too nutrient-rich to support the growth of a coral reef.

Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman. In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind.\\n\\nThe Joker debuted in Batman #1 (Spring 1940) as the eponymous character's first villain, shortly after Batman's debut in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). The Joker initially appeared as a remorseless serial killer, modeled after a joker playing card with a mirthless grin, who killed his victims with \\"Joker venom\\": a toxin which left their faces smiling grotesquely. The character was intended to be killed in his second appearance in Batman #1, after being stabbed in the heart. Finger wanted the Joker to die because of his concern that recurring villains would make Batman appear inept, but was overruled by then-editor Whitney Ellsworth; a hastily drawn panel, indicating that the Joker was still alive, was added to the comic. The Joker went on to appear in nine of Batman's first twelve issues.  The character's regular appearances quickly defined him as the archenemy of the dynamic duo, Batman and Robin; he killed dozens of people, and even derailed a train. By issue #13, Kane's work on the syndicated Batman newspaper strip left him little time for the comic book; artist Dick Sprang assumed his duties, and editor Jack Schiff collaborated with Finger on stories. Around the same time, DC Comics found it easier to market its stories to children without the more mature pulp elements that had originated many superhero comics. During this period, the first changes in the Joker began to appear, portraying him more as a prankster than threat; when he kidnaps Robin, Batman pays the ransom by check, meaning that the Joker cannot cash it without being arrested. Comic book writer Mark Waid suggests that the 1942 story \\"The Joker Walks the Last Mile\\" was the beginning point for the character's transformation into a more goofy incarnation, a period that Grant Morrison considered lasted the following thirty years.  The 1942 cover of Detective Comics #69, known as \\"Double Guns\\" (with the Joker emerging from a genie lamp, aiming two guns at Batman and Robin), is considered one of the greatest superhero comic covers of the Golden Age and is the only image of the character using traditional guns.

Rockwell transferred from high school to the Chase Art School at the age of 14. He then went on to the National Academy of Design and finally to the Art Students League. There, he was taught by Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent DuMond; his early works were produced for St. Nicholas Magazine, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) publication Boys' Life, and other youth publications. As a student, Rockwell was given small jobs of minor importance. His first major breakthrough came at age 18 with his first book illustration for Carl H. Claudy's Tell Me Why: Stories about Mother Nature.  After that, Rockwell was hired as a staff artist for Boys' Life magazine. In this role, he received 50 dollars' compensation each month for one completed cover and a set of story illustrations. It is said to have been his first paying job as an artist. At 19, he became the art editor for Boys' Life, published by the Boy Scouts of America. He held the job for three years, during which he painted several covers, beginning with his first published magazine cover, Scout at Ship's Wheel, which appeared on the Boys' Life September edition.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Norman Rockwell","rationale":"The text describes the life and career of American artist Norman Rockwell.\\nAs such, a fitting title for this paragraph would be: \\"Norman Rockwell\\"."},{"source":"Sleet is made out of water that is\\n\\nA -> vapor\\n\\nB -> hot\\n\\nC -> liquid\\n\\nD -> cold\\n\\nIs the right answer A, B, C or D ?","target":"D","rationale":"The water vapor in clouds condenses around particles of dust or pollen, forming liquid droplets.

A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again.

Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \\"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \\"my friend Liszt\\".

We have horses (normal and miniature), a donkey, goats, geese, chickens, a rabbit, dogs and cats. I own some of the animals myself and some belong to my parents- the vast majority of the animals are rescues. My mom absolutely loves inviting people, especially kids, over to hang out with animals they may not normally meet and to ride our horses. She always expects my help handling the animals and children, which I don't mind, I love animals and like kids. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe current problem is that my mom thinks I'm way too firm with children around the animals. I think that what I say is for the benefit of our pets' health and stress levels, and to keep the kids safe. She says that I'm a \\"killjoy\\", that I \\"make children and parents uncomfortable by being too controlling\\" (her words). This stung a bit I'll admit since I dislike having to be the one with boundaries but I consider my mom a people pleaser who wants all the kids/adults to have an idyllic farm experience without any realistic boundaries. Here are some examples of points of conflict:\\n\\nKids are chasing chickens around in 90 degree (or hotter) weather, until chickens are panting and obviously overheating. I say \\"Please don't chase them, they're nervous and it's too hot for them to run this much. There are quiet chickens right here you can pet or hold gently!\\" Repeated multiple times, eventually dropping the please. Finally pick up the chickens they're chasing (chickens don't run from me, they know my call) and put the chickens in the coop out of reach. Mom says that I'm ruining their fun and that it won't kill the chickens to get a little hot. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nKids running around the horses' hindquarters, hitting them in the face with a metal comb, screaming in excitement. I say \\"Guys, you have to be quiet and calm around horses or they may get nervous and spook or kick. Be gentle when you brush the horses.\\" Mom says it's fine, our horses are safe and quiet. I remind her that the horse in question once kicked out and caught her in the thigh when a horsefly bit her. Mom says I'm scaring the kids and getting worried over nothing. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nKids chasing already skittish cats, I ask them to not do that and play with the dogs instead, mom says it won't kill the cats to get chased. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere's a lot more unfortunately.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEventually my mom says maybe she shouldn't ask me to help her anymore with kids around since I'm \\"a killjoy and make people uncomfortable\\". I have never swore at, shouted at, or even raised my voice at kids. I always try to be calm but firm. However the one time I wasn't supervising it (in a roundabout way, to be fair) ended up with the death of one of my chickens so I'm not confident in my mom's ability to supervise all the animals and kids. I often time get left watching 6-8 kids by myself around a barn with large animals while my mom chats with the parents.

Mendes played with Antonio Carlos Jobim (regarded as a mentor) and many U.S. jazz musicians who toured Brazil.  Mendes formed the Sexteto Bossa Rio and recorded Dance Moderno in 1961. Touring Europe and the United States, Mendes recorded albums with Cannonball Adderley and Herbie Mann and played Carnegie Hall. Mendes moved to the U.S. in 1964 and cut two albums under the Sergio Mendes & Brasil '65 group name with Capitol Records and Atlantic Records.
