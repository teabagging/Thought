Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace.

For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people).\\nJenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party.

Iâm in no way suggesting Iâm going to make a fortune, nor that Iâm a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices.\\nArt blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly Iâm not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to.\\nIâd always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as âartâ.\\nOver the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life.

Third, Flacco again connected with Heap but only 9 yards this time. Finally, Rivers finished 35 yard connection between himself and Jackson as another TD for Chargers.

It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\\n\\n- The Synod of Whitby (664 A.D.) was a Northumbrian synod where King Oswiu of Northumbria ruled that his kingdom would calculate Easter and observe the monastic tonsure according to the customs of Rome, rather than the customs practised by Irish monks at Iona and its satellite institutions. The synod was summoned at Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (StreanÃ¦shalch), later called Whitby Abbey.\\n\\n- Wilfrid (originally spelled Wilfrith; c. 633Â  c. 709) was an English bishop and saint. Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria.\\n\\n- Ripon is a cathedral city in the Borough of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England.

After defeating Ptolemy in the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus concentrated on occupying the Ptolemaic possessions in Asia Minor. However, this brought Antiochus into conflict with Rhodes and Pergamum, two important Roman allies, and began a 'cold war' between Rome and Antiochus (not helped by the presence of Hannibal at the Seleucid court).

This presented Antiochus III with a pretext to invade Greece and 'liberate' it from Roman influence, thus starting the Roman-Syrian War (192â188 BC). In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia.

Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species.\\n\\nHint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to â25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population.

A smaller population will have less genetic diversity than a larger, healthier population of the same species because it is easier to maintain variation in large populations due to natural selection and random factors like mutation, migration and drift that can act on alleles within them. So Bobby who studied a small isolated group would observe this reduction while Will did not so he was observing the increase or maintenance of genetic diversity."},{"source":"In this task, you are given a question, and your task is to predict the context of the question.

In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality.\\nMany studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective.

Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment.

A mill race, leet, flume, penstock or lade is a sluice channelling water toward a water mill. The terms sluice, sluice gate, knife gate, and slide gate are used interchangeably in the water and wastewater control industry.\\n\\n- A reservoir (etymology: from French \\"rÃ©servoir\\" a \\"storehouse\\" ) is a storage space for fluids. These fluids may be water, hydrocarbons or gas. A reservoir usually means an enlarged natural or artificial lake, storage pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water.\\nReservoirs can be created by controlling a stream that drains an existing body of water. They can also be constructed in river valleys using a dam. Alternately, a reservoir can be built by excavating flat ground and/or constructing retaining walls and levees.\\n\\n- A bucket or pail is typically a watertight, vertical cylinder or truncated cone, with an open top and a flat bottom, attached to a semicircular carrying handle called the \\"bail\\".\\n\\n- A mill race , millrace or millrun is the current of water that turns a water wheel , or the channel ( sluice ) conducting water to or from a water wheel . Compared to the broad waters of a mill pond , the narrow current is swift and powerful . The race leading to the water wheel on a wide stream or mill pond is called the head race ( or headrace ) , and the race leading away from the wheel is called the tail race ( or tailrace ) . A mill race has many geographically specific names , such as leat , lade , flume , goit , penstock . These words all have more precise definitions and meanings will differ elsewhere . The original undershot waterwheel , described by Vitruvius was a run of the river wheel placed so a fast flowing stream would press against and turn the bottom of a bucketed wheel . In the first meaning of the term , the millrace was the stream ; in the sense of the word , there was no channel , so no race . As technology advanced , the stream was dammed forming a weir . This increased the head of water . Behind the weir was the millpond , or lodge . The water ( millrace ) was channelled to the waterwheel by a sluice or millrace - this was the head race . From the waterwheel , the water was channelled back to the stream by a sluice known as the tail race . When the tail race from one mill led to another mill where it acted as the head race this was known as the mid race . The level of water in the millrace could be controlled by a series of sluice gates .\\n\\n- A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load.\\n\\n- A mill pond (or millpond) is a body of water used as a reservoir for a water-powered mill.\\n\\n- A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut \\"teeth\\", or cogs, which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque. Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source. Gears almost always produce a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, through their gear ratio, and thus may be considered a simple machine. The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape. Two or more meshing gears, working in a sequence, are called a gear train or a \\"transmission\\". A gear can mesh with a linear toothed part, called a rack, thereby producing translation instead of rotation.\\n\\n- A blade is the portion of a tool, weapon, or machine with an edge that is designed to puncture, chop, slice or scrape surfaces or materials. A blade may be made from a flaking stone, such as flint, metal (usually steel), ceramic, or other material. Blades are one of humanity's oldest tools, and continue to be used for combat, food preparation, and other purposes.\\n\\n- A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on.\\n\\n- A flume is a human-made channel for water in the form of an open declined gravity chute whose walls are raised above the surrounding terrain, in contrast to a trench or ditch. Flumes are not to be confused with aqueducts, which are built to transport water, rather than transporting materials using flowing water as a flume does. Flumes route water from a diversion dam or weir to a desired materiel collection location.\\n\\n- A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.\\n\\n- A penstock (fr. \\"conduite forcÃ©e\\") is a sluice or gate or intake structure that controls water flow, or an enclosed pipe that delivers water to hydro turbines and sewerage systems. It is a term that has been inherited from the earlier technology of mill ponds and watermills.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat object entity has the relation of 'subclass of' with the subject 'mill race'? \\n\\nChoices:\\n- body of water\\n - channel\\n - collection\\n - constructing\\n - direction\\n - ditch\\n - diversion dam\\n - drawing\\n - driving\\n - dutch\\n - electronics\\n - food preparation\\n - forming\\n - french\\n - gas\\n - gate\\n - human\\n - industry\\n - knife\\n - lake\\n - machine\\n - mill\\n - natural\\n - number\\n - paper\\n - pipe\\n - power source\\n - preparation\\n - process\\n - ratio\\n - reservoir\\n - river\\n - rotation\\n - sequence\\n - sluice\\n - steel\\n - storage\\n - structure\\n - technology\\n - term\\n - textile\\n - tool\\n - top\\n - torque\\n - train\\n - transport\\n - turbine\\n - via\\n - water\\n - weapon\\n - weir\\n - wheel\\n - wire","target":"body of water","rationale":"In mill race, the most important context is \\"millrace\\".

He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the \\"Father of the Texas Blues\\". Jefferson's performances were distinctive because of his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists.\\n\\nJefferson was born blind (or possibly partially blind), near Coutchman, Texas. He was the youngest of seven (or possibly eight) children born to Alex and Clarissa Jefferson, who were sharecroppers. Disputes regarding the date of his birth derive from contradictory census records and draft registration records. By 1900, the family was farming southeast of Streetman, Texas, and his birth date is indicated as September 1893 in the 1900 census. The 1910 census, taken in May, before his birthday, further confirms his year of birth as 1893 and indicated that the family was farming northwest of Wortham, near his birthplace.  In his 1917 draft registration, Jefferson gave his birth date as October 26, 1894, further stating that he then lived in Dallas, Texas, and had been blind since birth. In the 1920 census, he is recorded as having returned to Freestone County and was living with his half-brother, Kit Banks, on a farm between Wortham and Streetman.  Jefferson began playing the guitar in his early teens and soon after he began performing at picnics and parties. He became a street musician, playing in East Texas towns in front of barbershops and on street corners. According to his cousin Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for Blind Lemon Jefferson, Classic Sides:  They were rough. Men were hustling women and selling bootleg and Lemon was singing for them all night... he'd start singing about eight and go on until four in the morning... mostly it would be just him sitting there and playing and singing all night.  In the early 1910s, Jefferson began traveling frequently to Dallas, where he met and played with the blues musician Lead Belly. Jefferson was one of the earliest and most prominent figures in the blues movement developing in the Deep Ellum section of Dallas. It is likely that he moved to Deep Ellum on a more permanent basis by 1917, where he met Aaron Thibeaux Walker, also known as T-Bone Walker. Jefferson taught Walker the basics of playing blues guitar in exchange for Walker's occasional services as a guide. By the early 1920s, Jefferson was earning enough money for his musical performances to support a wife and, possibly, a child. However, firm evidence of his marriage and children has not been found. Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\\n\\nWhen did he start performing?","target":"In the early 1910s,","rationale":"In the early 1910s, Jefferson began traveling frequently to Dallas, where he met and played with the blues musician Lead Belly."},{"source":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"people walking on sidewalks on a beautiful city street.\\", can we conclude \\"People walking through a city\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- yes\\n- it is not possible to tell\\n- no","target":"yes","rationale":"The premise describes people walking on sidewalks, or paved walkways located next to the street.

Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death, but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided. With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry's elder son, the matter rapidly became an open conflict. John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster, backed by his mother, Eleanor. Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II, who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent. With Arthur's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip's forces moving down the valley towards Tours, John's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two.\\",\\n\\nanswer the following question.

Passage:As a youth player Karlsons played for his local club FK LiepÄjas Metalurgs, being taken to the first team in 1998, at the age of 17. He spent the next six seasons with the club, becoming the second top scorer of the Latvian Higher League in 2003 with 26 goals, completing two hat-tricks during the season. All in all he played 96 matches for his local club, scoring 40 goals. After these bright appearances he had impressed clubs abroad, and in January 2004 Karlsons went on a month-long trial with the Russian Premier League club Shinnik Yaroslavl. Afterwards he signed a three-year contract with them. However, his spell there wasn't as successful as expected and was very short. After just one season, during which he played only 8 league matches without scoring goals, Karlsons returned to the Latvian Higher League, signing with the newly promoted, ambitious club Venta Kuldiga in 2005. However, the club struggled financially and after just five matches had to let some of their players go, including Karlsons, who returned to his hometown club, LiepÄjas Metalurgs later that year. He spent the next three seasons there, once again showing great performance. He scored a hat-trick in the 2005 season, and he also scored in the Latvian Cup final on 25 September 2005, which Metalurgs lost 2â1 to Venta KuldÄ«ga. Another hat-trick came in the 2006 season, which Karlsons finished as the second top scorer with 14 goals under his belt. In the Latvian Cup he scored a hat-trick in the 6â1 semi-final victory over DiÅ¾vanagi RÄzekne and then scored in the final, which the club won 2â1 over Skonto Riga. In December 2006 Karlsons was named the runner-up of the Latvian Player of the Year Award by the Latvian Football Federation behind the winner Aleksandrs KoÄ¼inko, who that time was the first-choice keeper for Rubin Kazan in the Russian Premier League. His contract with Metalurgs expired in July 2007 and it was not renewed. Player was then linked with the English Championship club Bristol City, before going on trial with Southampton.

The amastigote stage of the parasite infects phagocytes and modulates the effector function of the host cells. Our group has described that the interaction between Leishmania and immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) takes place through dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin that specifically recognizes fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens. The DC-SIGN-mediated recognition of Leishmania amastigotes does not induce DC maturation, and the DC-SIGN ligand/s on Leishmania parasites is/are still unknown. We have also found that the DC-SIGN-related molecule L-SIGN, specifically expressed in lymph node and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, acts as a receptor for L. infantum, the parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis, but does not recognize L. pifanoi, which causes the cutaneous form of the disease. Therefore, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN differ in their ability to interact with Leishmania species responsible for either visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis.

A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight.

David has to find out which tips are most useful for him.\\n\\nBut I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you donât use a muscle, it will get smaller and weakerâso use it or lose it.\\n\\nWhat is an answer for this question: In which tip the muscles would less likely be weaker, tip A or tip E?","target":"tip A","rationale":"Tip A involves weight lifting, while Tip E does not involve any exercise at all. Weight-lifting is a form of anaerobic exercise which increases the size and strength of skeletal muscles. Without using a muscle in this way, it will get smaller and weaker - so use it or lose it!\\nThis means that tip A would cause less likely for the muscles to be weaker than those who did only tip E without doing anything else (as per background information)."},{"source":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\\nArticle: Elizabeth and I are 18 now, and about to graduate.

Mohit Chauhan has lent his voice for nine songs and he is voice of character Jordan (played by Ranbir Kapoor). In 2010, during the development of the album, Rahman stated, \\"Rockstar is a character driven film and as one can guess from the title, there will be lots of guitar\\". In 2010, several meetings of Ali and the lyricist brought into a phrase titled, \\"Words destroy what I have to say\\". The song (Jo Bhi Main) that brings out the dilemma of the protagonist. Kamil suggested the last two lines (In lafzon ke maayne jaaney kaun badalta hai, main kehta hoon kuch, aur matlab aur koi ho jaata hai) for the particular song. But Ali didn't accept the lines because the protagonist wasn't supposed to have this level of sophistication as he was not poetic. To make it sound like something that could come from character Jordan, Kamil toned down the original after a few more rounds of discussion the lines were \\"Jo Bhi Main Kehna Chaahoon Barbaad Kare Alfaaz Mere\\" in the soundtrack. Upon development of the vociferating words Sadda Haq, Kamil stated that the situation needed a politically charged number that Jordan performs before a surging crowd at the height of his artistic angst. The slogan was used by students during Kamil's college days in Punjab to protest against the administration's arbitrary announcement of exams. On writing lyrics of \\"Phir Se Udd Chala\\", the analogies, he stated on introduction of offtrack lines like \\"Banu Raavan, Jiyoon Mar Marke\\" (\\"I become Raavan by continuing to live each time I die\\"), \\"The line was a metaphor for character Jordan who like the demon Ravan from the mythology Ramayana, dies a number of times and yet goes on with his life and that is why I used the Ravan simile.\\" As per Rahman two songs Jo Bhi Mein and Sadda Haq aspire to be in the tradition of song Satisfaction by The Rolling Stones and song Another Brick in the Wall by Pink Floyd. Further, he added, \\"Just like most rock songs stood for people's voices, here also the central character's cry relates to every one of us.\\" In an interview with Mid-Day, he stated, \\"I consciously kept away from using distorted guitars and heavy snazzy music. But I have done it here in Rockstar. Plus most songs are acoustic.\\" For the song Katiya Karun singer Harshdeep Kaur noted that the song was recorded at AR Studios, Powai, Mumbai. Rahman asked the translation of Katiya Karun lyrics to which she explained the meaning to him. The lyrics translate as, \\"I spin your cotton all night, the entire day is spent in this thought, I shall live and die for you, Be a spinning wheel Oâ my body.\\" Rahman wanted it to be a very catchy number as it was going to be a fun song with Jordan and Heer (played by Nargis Fakhri) on the road. Rahman started composing and created the song right in front of the singer. Kaur stated that it wasn't a folk song, only the rhyme Katiya Karun belongs to a Punjabi folk content. A part of the song was shot at a discotheque and hence, Kamil put in subtle metaphor lyrics in the song lines translating, \\"I will spin your cotton all night long\\" that indirectly implied \\"I will be at your services all night\\", thus giving it an item song touch.\\n Link Information: The Punjab (, , , ; ), also spelled and romanised as PanjÄb, is a geopolitical, cultural and historical region in South Asia, specifically in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising areas of eastern Pakistan and northern India.

Born into a Portuguese noble family in around 1480, Magellan became a skilled sailor and naval officer and was eventually selected by King Charles I of Spain to search for a westward route to the Maluku Islands (the \\"Spice Islands\\"). Commanding a fleet of five vessels, he headed south through the Atlantic Ocean to Patagonia, passing through the Strait of Magellan into a body of water he named the \\"peaceful sea\\" (the modern Pacific Ocean).\\n\\nMagellan was born in northern Portugal in around 1480, either at Vila Nova de Gaia, near Porto, in Douro Litoral Province, or at Sabrosa, near Vila Real, in Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. He was the son of Rodrigo de Magalhaes, Alcaide-Mor of Aveiro (1433-1500, son of Pedro Afonso de Magalhaes and wife Quinta de Sousa) and wife Alda de Mesquita and brother of Leonor or Genebra de Magalhaes, wife with issue of Joao Fernandes Barbosa.  In March 1505 at the age of 25, Magellan enlisted in the fleet of 22 ships sent to host D. Francisco de Almeida as the first viceroy of Portuguese India. Although his name does not appear in the chronicles, it is known that he remained there eight years, in Goa, Cochin and Quilon. He participated in several battles, including the battle of Cannanore in 1506, where he was wounded. In 1509 he fought in the battle of Diu. He later sailed under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in the first Portuguese embassy to Malacca, with Francisco Serrao, his friend and possibly cousin. In September, after arriving at Malacca, the expedition fell victim to a conspiracy ending in retreat. Magellan had a crucial role, warning Sequeira and saving Francisco Serrao, who had landed.  In 1511, under the new governor Afonso de Albuquerque, Magellan and Serrao participated in the conquest of Malacca. After the conquest their ways parted: Magellan was promoted, with a rich plunder and, in the company of a Malay he had indentured and baptized Enrique of Malacca, he returned to Portugal in 1512. Serrao departed in the first expedition sent to find the \\"Spice Islands\\" in the Moluccas, where he remained. He married a woman from Amboina and became a military advisor to the Sultan of Ternate, Bayan Sirrullah. His letters to Magellan would prove decisive, giving information about the spice-producing territories.  After taking a leave without permission, Magellan fell out of favour. Serving in Morocco, he was wounded, resulting in a permanent limp. He was accused of trading illegally with the Moors. The accusations were proved false, but he received no further offers of employment after 15 May 1514. Later on in 1515, he got an employment offer as a crew member on a Portuguese ship, but rejected this. In 1517 after a quarrel with King Manuel I, who denied his persistent demands to lead an expedition to reach the spice islands from the east (i.e., while sailing westwards, seeking to avoid the need to sail around the tip of Africa), he left for Spain. In Seville he befriended his countryman Diogo Barbosa and soon married the daughter of Diogo's second wife, Maria Caldera Beatriz Barbosa. They had two children: Rodrigo de Magalhaes and Carlos de Magalhaes, both of whom died at a young age. His wife died in Seville around 1521.  Meanwhile, Magellan devoted himself to studying the most recent charts, investigating, in partnership with cosmographer Rui Faleiro, a gateway from the Atlantic to the South Pacific and the possibility of the Moluccas being Spanish according to the demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas.

Since cows have 4 feet each, there is a total of 22 x 4 = 88 cow feet which would mean that the total number of feet is 136 - 88 = 48. However, this does not match up with what we know about hens having 2 heads and 4 feet each because if they had 48 heads they would also have 192 (48 x 4) feet which would mean 240 (192 + 48) total animal feet which is not equal to 136 as given in the problem statement, so 24 cannot be correct either.\\n\\nThe only option left to test is 28; using similar logic as above but working backwards yields that if there were 28 hens then they would contribute 112 (28 x 4) animal-feet which leaves 24 (136 - 112) animal-feet left over from something else; since this \\\\\\"something else\\\\\\" has 2 heads per animal then it must have 6 legs per animal (= 12 / 2), therefore it is a cow because cows have 6 legs instead of 3 like most animals do."},{"source":"You are given a new situation: John was sitting at point C near a railway track.

Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.By the 1950s gambling and prostitution were being actively repressed in most parts of Texas. In 1953, the police commissioner, Walter L. Johnston, under pressure from local citizens groups concerned about moral decline and high rates of venereal disease, shut down the red-light district. However, the mayoral victory of George Roy Clough, a supporter of regulated vice, led to the district's being re-established in 1955. That year Galveston was labeled by national anti-prostitution groups as the \\"worst spot in the nation as far as prostitution is concerned\\".Paul Hopkins won the 1956 election for sheriff and set about shutting down the island's illegal activities once and for all. One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an undercover operation by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room. In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison (with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island, along with liquor imports. Forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments were reportedly closed, and 2,000 slot machines were destroyed.

Both teams traded possessions through the first quarter before Steelers' wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger three minutes into the second period. A Shaun Suisham extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead. The hometown Giants answered, tying up the game with a 1-yard run by Andre Brown. Shortly after, with around five minutes remaining in the half, New York's Osi Umenyiora was able to knock the ball from Roethlisberger's hand as the quarterback was attempting a pass. Giants linebacker Michael Boley took full advantage of the turnover, scooping up the fumble and giving the Giants a 14-7 lead on a 70-yard touchdown return. The Steelers were able to put together a final drive of the half, and a 30-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham narrowed the Giants' lead to four points at the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes extended the home team's lead by three via a 50-yard field goal. With a minute to go in the period, Tynes would successfully convert a 23-yard attempt and give the Giants a ten-point lead with a quarter to play. A 51-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Mike Wallace would cut into the Giants' lead less than a minute into the fourth.

It mostly follows the unities of time (happens in a short amount of time, usually 24 hours), place (happens in one place) and plot (one or few plot lines). It also has a five-act structure, and most of the characters follow decorum. However, with verisimilitude (or, the appearance of truth), the play is lacking. The idea that the entire plot line could happen within 24 to 48 hours is astonishing.\\nIn the first act, Phraates, an officer at court, and Gotarzes, a prince, discuss Prince Arsaces  triumphal return from foreign wars. But, there is trouble at home. Vardanes, Arsaces  brother, is jealous of his marital successes, and Thermusa, Arsaces  stepmother and the Queen of Parthia wants to avenge her son Vonones who was killed by Arsaces for treason. Vardanes and his officer, Lysias, decide to use Thermusa s vengeance to destroy Arsaces. Meanwhile, Evanthe, whose dad, King Bethas, has been imprisoned, is in love with Arsaces. But Artabanus, the King of Parthia, has illicit feelings for Evanthe. The plot then moves into Act Two; when Vardanes and Lysias hear Arsaces tell Bethas that he loves Evanthe, they decide to tell King Artabanus that Arsaces is a traitor for sympathizing with Parthian enemies. And that is all; like most plays with a five-act structure, there are usually one or two acts that are just one scene. This keeps the five-act structure, but does not mess with the believability of the plot.\\nBy the time the plot reaches Act Three, Thermusa is very angry because she knows King Artabanus is lusting after someone else. She tells this to Vardanes, who decides to use this to destroy Arsaces and take the throne of Parthia for himself. Arsaces asks for Evanthe s hand in marriage in front of King Artabanus. Artabanus decides to let Arsaces have Evanthe because he promised Arsaces anything he wanted for being such an awesome child. Evanthe tells Arsaces that King Artabanus loves her, to which he replies that he loves her more. Vardanes then tells King Artabanus that Arsaces is a traitor.\\nAct Four takes a sharp plot turn, which causes some incongruities. Phraates tells Gotarzes that he overheard Vardanes and Lysias talking about how they killed King Artabanus in his sleep. Vardanes and Lysias plan on blaming Arsaces, while Phraates and Gotarzes plan on telling the general Barzaphernes about who actually killed the king. Arsaces has been accused of the regicide and thrown in prison along with Bethas. They bond over their fear for Evanthe s safety. Thermusa enters the prison to kill Arsaces, but she sees a bloody ghost of King Artabanus, which causes her to  brain  herself against the wall, committing suicide. Barzaphernes appears and releases Arsaces. Together, they plan to get Vardanes and make Parthia right once more.\\nIn the exciting conclusion of Act Five, Vardanes comes on to Evanthe, but she does not like it. Before Vardanes can hurt Evanthe, Lysias runs in and tells Vardanes that Arsaces has escaped and knows of Vardanes  plot. Then, a huge battle occurs, pitting Vardanes, Lysias and all of their followers against Arsaces, Barzaphernes, Phraates, Gotarzes and their men. Cleone, Evanthe s maid, watches the battle from a window. Cleone believes Arsaces was killed in the battle by Vardanes, but it was really Phraates.

At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios,  in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him \\"just a little wear on [his] tape heads\\". While completing the early recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments, except drums, himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as Purest Feeling, were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, Pretty Hate Machine (1989). The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.Reznor coined the name \\"Nine Inch Nails\\" because it \\"abbreviated easily\\", rather than for \\"any literal meaning\\".

At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (MarÂ­seilles) around 600âb.c. , followed by other ports at HyÃ¨res, Antibes, and Nice.

However, the Browns' ended the day with a 34-7 loss to the Steelers. A number of Browns errors gave Pittsburgh opportunities to take a first quarter lead. After being stopped on their first possession, the Browns were forced to punt. Paul Ernster fumbled the snap, which resulted in a poor kick, and the Browns were called for four penalties on the play. The Steelers took possession on the Browns' 22-yard line and scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Ben Ben Roethlisberger to Hines Ward. On the Browns' next possession, Charlie Frye threw an interception to Deshea Townsend, which eventually led to the Steelers' second score of the game, a 26-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. The Brown next possession ended when Jamal Lewis fumbled the ball at the Browns' 40-yard line. The Steelers quickly converted the turnover, with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes on the next play to bring the score to 17-0. After being sacked five times and throwing for only 34&#160;yards on 4-of-10 passing, Frye was removed from the game and was replaced by second-string quarterback Derek Anderson. In the second quarter, Willie Parker fumbled the ball and gave the Browns possession. However, the team was forced to punt, and just two drives later, the Browns fumbled the ball again - this time on a sack by Ryan Clark of Anderson. The Browns were able to hold the Steelers scoreless through the second quarter as Roethlisberger failed to connect on his last six pass attempts of the quarter. However, the Steelers also held the Browns scoreless, and the teams entered halftime with the Steelers ahead 17-0. The second half began well for the Steelers, with an eight-play, 71-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie Matt Spaeth. The Browns countered with a long drive of 76&#160;yards that ended with a one-yard touchdown pass from Anderson to second-year fullback Lawrence Vickers, cutting the deficit to 24-7. However, this would be the Browns' only score of the game. On the next drive, the Steelers answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Heath Miller, giving the Steelers a 31-7 advantage. The Browns punted on their next possession, and the Steelers capped an eight-minute drive with a 31-yard field goal by Reed, giving the Steelers a 34-7 lead, which they never surrendered. On the Browns' next offensive possession, Braylon Edwards dropped a pass from Anderson, which was ruled a fumble. Following a Steelers punt, Anderson threw an interception to Ike Taylor on a pass intended for Edwards, and Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch ran the clock out, securing the win. The loss put the Browns record at 0-1, and allowed the Steelers to take a one-game lead in the overall series, 56 wins to 55. Following the game, head coach Romeo Crennel stated that he didn't know who would start at quarterback in the next game versus the Cincinnati Bengals. He also stood by his decision not to insert rookie Brady Quinn into the game, even after chants were heard from the home crowd hoping otherwise. On Tuesday, September 11, the Browns traded Frye, who was expected to start against the Bengals in week two, to the Seattle Seahawks for a sixth-round draft choice.

John was a pious and dedicated Emperor who was determined to undo the damage to the empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.\\nDuring his twenty-five-year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the West and decisively defeated the Pechenegs at the Battle of Beroia. He thwarted Hungarian and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothair III against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.In the later part of his reign, John focused his activities on the East, personally leading numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. His campaigns fundamentally altered the balance of power in the East, forcing the Turks onto the defensive, while restoring many towns, fortresses, and cities across the peninsula to the Byzantines. He defeated the Danishmend Emirate of Melitene and reconquered all of Cilicia, while forcing Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, to recognise Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the Emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into the Holy Land at the head of the combined forces of the Empire and the Crusader states; yet despite his great vigour pressing the campaign, his hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies. In 1142, John returned to press his claims to Antioch, but he died in the spring of 1143 following a hunting accident.","target":"Komnenos","rationale":"The context describes the reign of Alexios's son, John II Komnenos.

Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs, but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.

The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores.

Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in Passive solar building design, greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright, in the 1960s by Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg and Sim Van der Ryn in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles.

A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences.\\n\\n\\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is amongst Roger Taylor's most famous songs in the Queen catalogue. The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording.  Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \\"love of his life\\". The song is dedicated to him, the album says: \\"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\\".  When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury (author of the first single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") to allow it to be the B-side and reportedly locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the main single did for Mercury.  The song was often played live during the 1977-81 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008.

In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, \\"His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'.\\" They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes \\"cloak his actions in an OÃ°inic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning\\". While in prison, Vikernes released the book VargsmÃ¥l, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the HÃ¡vamÃ¡l, though with \\"an eye on Mein Kampf\\". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, \\"proving both that it is not just the early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator\\".Vikernes himself has connected the church burnings to an idea of resurgent Viking paganism. The first such burning, that of Fantoft Church on June 6, 1992, was thought by many to be related to Satanism, since the burning occurred on the sixth day of the week, on day six of the sixth month and was thus a reference to the Number of the Beast. Vikernes contends that the date June 6 was really picked because the first recorded Viking raid (upon Lindisfarne) occurred, according to Vikernes, on June 6, 793.

Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream...\\n\\nand the situation: Bobby and Sally are siblings that currently live in different cities. Bobby lives in a city that has wildfires on a regular basis.

Eventually he cheated on her with one of her best friends and she kicked him out. I didnât even notice he was gone for a week because he was so absent in my life. He apologized, turned into the man she first met and they tried again. He again cheated on her and she left him again, that time for good. They ended up finalizing the divorce a year later. I remember her telling me that she confronted him about his change of character and he had told her âEveryone puts on an act at first.â As if it was a normal thing. He had depression and I believe he wanted everyone to be just as miserable as he was. After they got divorced he had on and off again relationships, got a girl pregnant and got married, then she divorced him. He lived with his cousin for a while. The only stability he ever had was with my mom and I. I think thatâs why he wanted to leave. Stability meant he had to become an adult and he didnât want to have to take responsibility.\\nWhy didn't she notice at first when Rob was gone?\\n- He was so absent in her life\\n- He cheated on her mom\\n- He was mean\\n- not enough information","target":"He was so absent in her life","rationale":"The context is about a woman who was married three times, and the first two marriages ended up as messes.

Penson won 50 games pitching for his base team, although sources disagree about the branch in which he served, reported as the United States Air Force and the U.S. Army. Penson made the Phillies out of training camp in 1954 as a member of the team's early-season, 28-man roster. His five games pitched included three starts, and he split two decisions. His lone MLB win came in his first start, on Sunday, May 16, 1954. in the second game of a doubleheader at Connie Mack Stadium. He went six innings against the St. Louis Cardinals, and allowed four hits, four bases on balls, and one earned run. But he was forced to leave the game leading 6â3 when the game was suspended because of Pennsylvania blue laws prohibiting sporting events on Sunday evenings. The game resumed on Monday, May 17, and Philadelphia went on to win, 8â4; veteran Murry Dickson nailed down the save with three innings of one-run relief.\\n Passage 2:The Ohio Country located between Britain's Thirteen Colonies and France's New France saw France and Britain clash. In 1753 the French sent an expedition south from Montreal that began constructing forts in the upper reaches of the Ohio River. In 1754 the Province of Virginia sent the Virginia Regiment led by George Washington to the area to assist in the construction of a British fort at present-day Pittsburgh, but the larger French force had driven away a smaller British advance party and built Fort Duquesne. Washington and some native allies ambushed a company of French scouts at the Battle of Jumonville Glen in late May 1754. In the skirmish the French envoy Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was left dead leading to a diplomatic incident. The French responded in force from Fort Duquesne, and in July Washington was forced to surrender at the Battle of Fort Necessity. Despite the conflict between them, the two nations were not yet formally at war.\\n Passage 3:SigurÃ°sson worked on monitoring and research of the volcanoes of the Caribbean until 1974, when he was appointed professor at the Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island.

The Colts further extended their lead with a 4-yard pass from Hasselbeck to former Texan Andre Johnson to lead 10-0 with 1:27 left in the first. Ending the 1st quarter, Houston trailed 0-10 with the ball on their own 34. On their second play of the 2nd quarter, the Texans punted the ball away on 4th and 1. Houston caught a break following a chop-block penalty against Frank Gore that made it 1st and 25 for Indianapolis near midfield. On 3rd and 22 a roughing the passer call against J. J. Watt gave the Colts a 1st down that put them in the red zone. On 3rd down Hasselbeck threw to T. Y. Hilton, who dropped the ball for an incomplete pass. After the play, Indianapolis head coach Chuck Pagano drew a 15-yard penalty after rushing the field. After a series of penalties, the Colts settled for a 42-yard Vinatieri field goal to lead 13-0 with 7:41 remaining in the half. A roughing the passer call against the Colts gave the Texans an automatic 1st down on what would have been 3rd down. After Mallett was slow to get up, Brian Hoyer came in at the quarterback position. On 3rd and 10 Hoyer picked up the 1st down passing 24 yards to DeAndre Hopkins. Hoyer connected with Hopkins once again to pick up a long 1st down conversion to put the Texans in the red zone. A chop block penalty pushed Houston back to the 31 for a 2nd and 21. Houston finally got on the board with a 36-yard field goal from Nick Novak to trail 3-13 with 2:08 left in the first half. With no timeouts left, Hoyer completed a 95-yard drive with a 42-yard Hail Mary pass to Jaelen Strong to trail 9-13. With Novak's kick good, Houston trailed Indianapolis 10-13 going into halftime. Receiving the ball to start off the first half, the Colts quickly marched down field to score a touchdown on the opening play. With 13:02 left in the 3rd, Indianapolis extended their lead to 20-10. The Texans were not as lucky as an offensive pass-interference call against Hopkins put Houston into a three-and-out. On the Colts' next possession Houston's defense forced them into their first 3-and-out of the night. On the Texans' next possession Hoyer connected with Strong once again for a touchdown. With Novak making the extra point, Houston trailed 17-20 with 4:03 left in the 3rd. Making their first 3rd conversion of the night, the Colts continued to march down the field to hold their 20-17 lead at the end of the 3rd. With a face-mask penalty called against Jadeveon Clowney, the Colts came closer to the Houston red zone. However, on the next play an offside penalty was called against Indianapolis. An interception was over-called following a holding penalty against Houston. On the next play the Texans were penalized again with a pass interference call against Kareem Jackson, making it 1st and goal from the Houston 1 for the Colts. Hasselbeck connected with Johnson to make it 26-17. With Vinatieri making the extra point, Indianapolis extended their lead to 27-17 with 10:28 left to play. Receiving the ball, Foster gained 32 yards to put Houston into Indianapolis territory, keeping hopes of a comeback alive. The Texans ended the drive with a 49-yard field goal from Novak to trail 20-27 with 6:07 left to play. Houston kicked the ball back to Indianapolis, who took the touchback. The Colts punted the ball back with 3:39 left to play, with the Texans returning it to their own 36. By the 2-minute warning Houston had reached Indianapolis territory at the Colts' 38. On the play following the 2 minute warning, Hoyer threw an interception that was picked off by Adams. Indianapolis held onto the ball and ran the clock out to win, 27-20.\\n\\nHow many more field goals did Vinatieri kick than Novak in the first half?","target":"2","rationale":"The goal of this problem is to calculate how many more field goals Vinatieri kicked than Novak in the first half. Before that, we have to check how many field goals each kicker made during the first half. It is mentioned that Indianapolis extended their lead with a 48-yard and 42-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri respectively; on the other hand, Houston got on board with a 36-yard field goal from Nick Novak.

It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pÃ©dalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Ãrard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940.

In the principal faÃ§ade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558â70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement.  On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it.

Some scientists hold the view that the air inside houses may be more dangerous than the air outside.

Believe it or not, some pollutants can cause breathing diseases of blood and even cancer.\\nWhat made us feel relieved is that there's growing concern about the problem now. It is true that when builders began constructing houses and offices they did not want to waste energy.\\nthey built buildings that prevented or limited the flow of air between inside and outside. For the same purpose, man-made building materials were employed to build houses, which are now known to let out some harmful gases.\\nFacing the serious challenge, scientists have been searching for a way to handle the problem. To everyone's delight, they discovered a natural pollution control system for building--green plants, though they do not really know how plants control air pollution. Scientists suppose that a plant's leaves absorb or take in the pollutants and in exchange gives out oxygen through its leaves and tiny organizations on its roots. Therefore they recommend that all buildings should have one large plant or several small plants inside for every nine square meters of space. Because studies indicate that different plants absorb different chemicals, the most effective way to clean the air is to use different kinds of plants. In conclusion, having green plants inside your house can make it a prettier and healthier place.

Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive.\\nKipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias.

Miami opened the game with an impressive 80-yard drive after the opening kickoff, which lead to a quarterback Ryan Tannehill two-yard rushing touchdown. Two possessions later at the (3:28) mark in the first quarter, Oakland quarterback Carson Palmer threw a 64-yard touchdown to Mike Goodson tying the game.

Known as Emesa at the start of the first century AD, the city was at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire, and ruled by the Emesene dynasty, a client kingdom of the Romans. Nearly 2,000 years later, the lootersâdigging near the former site of a monument to Sampsiceramusâfound a complex of rich tombs, and removed the grave goods. Their looting was uncovered because small golden plaques, adorning the burial shroud of the body in tomb 11, flaked off when disturbed. The next morning, children noticed these gold flakes mixed in with the earth and brought them to a bazaar, where it came to the attention of the police; it ultimately led to the arrest of the looters, and the confiscation of the grave objects. The objects, including the helmet, were then secured for the state collection by Emir Djaafar Abd el-Kader, curator of the National Museum of Damascusâeven as merchants, eager to capitalise on the stories, hawked modern forgeries and unrelated ancient objects said to come from the tombs of Emesa.The prompt intervention of el-Kader, who investigated the finds and interrogated the looters, allowed the finds to be recovered and well-understood. He also led further excavations, as did the French archaeologists Daniel Schlumberger and Henri Seyrig. The tomb in which the helmet was foundâlabelled tomb number 1, of the 22 in the complexâwas a pitted grave with two chambers, one upper and one lower. The lower chamber, constituting the proper tomb, had soil for a floor and rock for walls; it measured 2.2 by 1.25 m (7 ft 3 in by 4 ft 1 in), and was 1.72 m (5 ft 8 in) high.

The club was founded in 1876 and played their first few matches at Sophia Gardens, but soon relocated to Cardiff Arms Park where they have been based ever since. They built a reputation as one of the great clubs in world rugby largely through a series of wins against international touring sides.\\n\\nAfter the unsuccessful rebel season, Cardiff sign British Lion outside-half Neil Jenkins as well as Wales internationals second-row Craig Quinnell and flanker Martyn Williams. The start of the 1999-2000 season for Cardiff was hampered by them missing 13 first choice players due to the World Cup, and in late September they fell to a humiliating 60-18 defeat away to Llanelli at Stradey Park. However, despite this poor start and failing to win in the first rounds of the Heineken Cup, they progressed to the Heineken Cup quarter-finals, where they were beaten by Llanelli, and clinched the Welsh/Scottish League title with three games remaining, The season is also notable for a club record victory of 116-0 over Duvnant in the Welsh/Scottish League, and the club going unbeaten at home for almost the whole season, before losing 41-40 to Swansea in their very last game of the season (with the title already sewn up). This was Cardiff's first defeat at the Arms Park for over two years, since 13 December 1997, again against Swansea.  During the close season Cardiff lost Leigh Davies to Llanelli but signed South African centre Pieter Muller to replace him. They won their first five Welsh/Scottish League matches, seemingly making certain they would retain their title, especially as Swansea lost three of their first five games. The highlight of the season was in late October, when the Blue and Blacks stunned English Premiership leaders Saracens by defeating them home and away in the Heineken Cup.  The club's great form began to stutter as the millennium drew to a close, but it was in January the wheels really came off. After a magnificent 42-16 victory over Ulster, two yellow cards led Cardiff to defeat in Toulouse, meaning they would have to travel to Gloucester in the quarter-finals. A turgid forward battle resulted in a 21-15 defeat for the Blue and Blacks. Two weeks later they then lost to Bridgend, their first home defeat of the season, meaning Swansea pulled ahead in the title race. Another defeat at Ebbw Vale in March condemned them to a trophyless season. Following the unsuccessful season Lynn Howells's contract was not renewed and Rudy Joubert was appointed director of rugby. Gareth Thomas also left the club along with nine other players, but Rob Appleyard, Matt Allen and Craig Hudson all joined.  For the 2001 Lions tour, four Cardiff players were picked, Rob Howley, Neil Jenkins, Dai Young and Martyn Williams. Young became the first player to tour for the Lions in three different decades. Howley started the first two Tests, with Williams on the bench in all three, and Jenkins coming on to replace Jonny Wilkinson in the second.

It sits alongside Lake Burley Griffin, next to the Royal Canberra Golf Club and Scrivener Dam. The house was built in 1891 as the headquarters for the Yarralumla property. Also located alongside Scrivener Dam is the National Zoo & Aquarium. The nearby Yarralumla woolshed is available for event hire, often playing host to parties and bush dances. The land surrounding the woolshed has been developed as an equestrian park, including areas for showjumping, eventing and endurance riding. The Yarralumla brickworks are notable as the first industrial manufacturing facility in the ACT. The brickworks were closed temporarily several times due to the Great Depression and both World Wars. Proposals to modernise the brickworks were rejected by the National Capital Development Commission in the early 1970s and they closed permanently in 1976. Presently the site is closed to the public and is in a state of disrepair. The unfenced parkland around the brickworks is a popular recreation area for Yarralumla residents. Residential development is proposed for the 42-hectare site, initially including 1,600 new dwellings, although this is now likely to be significantly reduced.The eastern end of Yarralumla is home to many of the diplomatic missions in Canberra, many of which are built in a traditional style reflecting that of their respective home countries.

The terms sluice, sluice gate, knife gate, and slide gate are used interchangeably in the water and wastewater control industry.\\n\\n- A reservoir (etymology: from French \\"rÃ©servoir\\" a \\"storehouse\\" ) is a storage space for fluids. These fluids may be water, hydrocarbons or gas. A reservoir usually means an enlarged natural or artificial lake, storage pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water.\\nReservoirs can be created by controlling a stream that drains an existing body of water. They can also be constructed in river valleys using a dam. Alternately, a reservoir can be built by excavating flat ground and/or constructing retaining walls and levees.\\n\\n- A bucket or pail is typically a watertight, vertical cylinder or truncated cone, with an open top and a flat bottom, attached to a semicircular carrying handle called the \\"bail\\".\\n\\n- A mill race , millrace or millrun is the current of water that turns a water wheel , or the channel ( sluice ) conducting water to or from a water wheel . Compared to the broad waters of a mill pond , the narrow current is swift and powerful . The race leading to the water wheel on a wide stream or mill pond is called the head race ( or headrace ) , and the race leading away from the wheel is called the tail race ( or tailrace ) . A mill race has many geographically specific names , such as leat , lade , flume , goit , penstock . These words all have more precise definitions and meanings will differ elsewhere . The original undershot waterwheel , described by Vitruvius was a run of the river wheel placed so a fast flowing stream would press against and turn the bottom of a bucketed wheel . In the first meaning of the term , the millrace was the stream ; in the sense of the word , there was no channel , so no race . As technology advanced , the stream was dammed forming a weir . This increased the head of water . Behind the weir was the millpond , or lodge . The water ( millrace ) was channelled to the waterwheel by a sluice or millrace - this was the head race . From the waterwheel , the water was channelled back to the stream by a sluice known as the tail race . When the tail race from one mill led to another mill where it acted as the head race this was known as the mid race . The level of water in the millrace could be controlled by a series of sluice gates .\\n\\n- A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load.\\n\\n- A mill pond (or millpond) is a body of water used as a reservoir for a water-powered mill.\\n\\n- A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut \\"teeth\\", or cogs, which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque. Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source. Gears almost always produce a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, through their gear ratio, and thus may be considered a simple machine. The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape. Two or more meshing gears, working in a sequence, are called a gear train or a \\"transmission\\". A gear can mesh with a linear toothed part, called a rack, thereby producing translation instead of rotation.\\n\\n- A blade is the portion of a tool, weapon, or machine with an edge that is designed to puncture, chop, slice or scrape surfaces or materials. A blade may be made from a flaking stone, such as flint, metal (usually steel), ceramic, or other material. Blades are one of humanity's oldest tools, and continue to be used for combat, food preparation, and other purposes.\\n\\n- A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on.\\n\\n- A flume is a human-made channel for water in the form of an open declined gravity chute whose walls are raised above the surrounding terrain, in contrast to a trench or ditch. Flumes are not to be confused with aqueducts, which are built to transport water, rather than transporting materials using flowing water as a flume does. Flumes route water from a diversion dam or weir to a desired materiel collection location.\\n\\n- A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.\\n\\n- A penstock (fr. \\"conduite forcÃ©e\\") is a sluice or gate or intake structure that controls water flow, or an enclosed pipe that delivers water to hydro turbines and sewerage systems. It is a term that has been inherited from the earlier technology of mill ponds and watermills.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'subclass of' with 'body of water'.","target":"mill race","rationale":"The rationale is : \\"mill race\\""},{"source":"The goal is to predict an English answer string for an input English question. \\nQuestion : \\"Who wrote \\"\\"Futility\\"\\" (1898) about an enormous \\"\\"unsinkable\\"\\" British passenger liner called the Titan, which hits an iceberg and sinks in the North Atlantic with the loss of nearly all on board?\\"\\nAnswer :","target":"Morgan Robertson","rationale":"The answer is \\"Morgan Robertson\\", since he wrote the novel Futility (1898) about Titanic."},{"source":"You are given an open-domain question from an open movie database.

In January 1916, as a General Staff Officer (GSO), Elles was sent by General Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF on the Western Front, to investigate the first tanks or \\"caterpillars\\" being built in England. He attended the first trials of \\"Mother\\" and reported back to Haig on its success. During the summer of 1916, he was tasked to report back from the Somme, where the tanks were first used. Elles was appointed to head the Heavy Branch (the first tank units) of the Machine Gun Corps in France on 29 September 1916, with the temporary rank of colonel. His responsibilities included its advanced training and tactical employment.

He was the second child of Eula (nee Wade) and Isaac Hayes, Sr. After his mother died young and his father abandoned his family, Isaac, Jr., was raised by his maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Willie Wade, Sr. The child of a sharecropper family, he grew up working on farms in Shelby County, Tennessee, and in Tipton County.\\n\\nIn 1995, Hayes appeared as a Las Vegas minister impersonating himself in the comedy series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. He launched a comeback on the Virgin label in May 1995 with Branded, an album of new material that earned impressive sales figures as well as positive reviews from critics who proclaimed it a return to form. A companion album released around the same time, Raw and Refined, featured a collection of previously unreleased instrumentals, both old and new. Hayes worked on the theme for the 1996 theatrical release 'Beavis and Butt-Head Do America', producing a piece which was essentially a hybrid of 'The Theme From Shaft' and the theme from the original 'Beavis and Butt-Head' TV show.  Soon after, Hayes joined the founding cast of Comedy Central's animated TV series, South Park. Hayes provided the voice for the character of \\"Chef\\", the amorous elementary-school lunchroom cook, from the show's debut on August 13, 1997 (one week shy of his 55th birthday), through the end of its ninth season in 2006. The role of Chef drew on Hayes's talents both as an actor and as a singer, thanks to the character's penchant for making conversational points in the form of crudely suggestive soul songs. An album of songs from the series appeared in 1998 with the title Chef Aid: The South Park Album reflecting Chef's popularity with the show's fans, and the Chef song \\"Chocolate Salty Balls\\" became a number-one U.K. hit. However, when the South Park movie South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was released the following year, Chef was the only major character who did not perform a showcase song in the film; his lone musical contribution was \\"Good Love,\\" a track on the soundtrack album which originally appeared on Black Moses in 1971 and is not heard in the movie  In 2000, he appeared on the soundtrack of the French movie The Magnet on the song \\"Is It Really Home\\" written and composed by rapper Akhenaton (IAM) and composer Bruno Coulais. In 2002, Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After he played a set at the Glastonbury Festival, the same year a documentary highlighting Isaac's career and his impact on many of the Memphis artists in the 1960s onwards was produced, \\"Only The Strong Survive\\". In 2004, Hayes appeared in a recurring minor role as the Jaffa Tolok on the television series Stargate SG-1.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.\\n\\n- Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.\\n\\n- Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88Â million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\\n\\n- Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.\\n\\n- The true parrots are about 350 species of colorful flighted (with a few notable exceptions) hook-billed, mostly herbivorous birds forming the superfamily Psittacoidea, one of the three superfamilies in the biological order Psittaciformes (parrots). True parrots are widespread, with species in Mexico, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Australia, and eastwards across the Pacific Ocean as far as Polynesia. The true parrots include many of the familiar parrots including macaws, conures, lorikeets, eclectus, amazon parrots, African gray parrot.\\n\\n- A cockatoo is a parrot that is any of the 21 species belonging to the bird family Cacatuidae, the only family in the superfamily Cacatuoidea. Along with the Psittacoidea (true parrots) and the Strigopoidea (large New Zealand parrots), they make up the order Psittaciformes (parrots). The family has a mainly Australasian distribution, ranging from the Philippines and the eastern Indonesian islands of Wallacea to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Australia. \\n\\n- Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India.\\n\\n- The family Psittacidae is one of three families of true parrots, and consists of two subfamilies, the Old World or Afrotropical parrots of Psittacinae) and the New World or Neotropical parrots of Arinae. The family numbers approximately 10 species in the Old World, and 148 species in the New World, and included several species that have gone extinct in recent centuries. Some of the most iconic birds in the world are represented here, such as the blue-and-gold macaw among the New World parrots and the African grey parrot among the Old World parrots. These parrots are found in tropical and subtropical zones and inhabit Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands, sub-Saharan Africa and the island of Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Two parrots, one extinct, formerly inhabited North America.\\n\\n- Psittacinae is a subfamily of Afrotropical or Old World parrots; the eleven species are found in two genera. Among the species is the iconic African grey parrot. These parrots are native to sub-Saharan Africa, the island of Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula.\\n\\n- Sub-Saharan Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. According to the UN, it consists of all African countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara. It contrasts with North Africa, whose territories are part of the League of Arab states within the Arab world. Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world.\\n\\n- Parrots, also known as psittacines , are birds of the roughly 393 species in 92 genera that make up the order Psittaciformes, found in most tropical and subtropical regions. The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea (\\"true\\" parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.\\n\\n- In biogeography, a pantropical (\\"across the tropics\\") distribution is one which covers tropical regions of all continents. Examples include the plant genera \\"Acacia\\" and \\"Bacopa\\".\\n\\n- Psilopsiagon is a genus of parrot in the family Psittacidae . It contains the following species : Mountain parakeet ( Psilopsiagon aurifrons ) Grey - hooded parakeet ( Psilopsiagon aymara )\\n\\n- Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000Â sqÂ mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America.

Tumour and stroma interactions are critical in determining the biological characteristics of malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of myofibroblasts and their roles in the invasive characteristics of ACC.', 'Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of vimentin (VIM), Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and CD34 in ACCs and normal salivary gland controls. A significant difference in Î±-SMA expression was found between normal controls and ACCs, suggesting the presence of myofibroblasts in ACCs. Immunohistochemical staining also demonstrated higher MMP2 expression in the stroma of ACCs than in the controls (P < 0.001). Primary culture of myofibroblasts from one ACC showed great invasive activity, with high expression of MMP2 and C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.\\\\Question: Do myofibroblasts from salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinomas promote cancer invasion by expressing MMP2 and CXCL12?","target":"This study demonstrated the presence of myofibroblasts in ACC.

The night goes well until the electricity powers out and a package arrives at the door containing six cards; written on them are the words, \\"prostitute, infidel, homosexual, rapist and hypocrite\\".

He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.\\n\\nHint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment.

He receives a phone call from a woman (Julianne Moore) who warns that the FBI is about to arrest him and he needs to run.\\nDisbelieving, Jerry is caught by the FBI and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton). While Morgan confers with Air Force OSI Special Agent Zoe PÃÂ©rez (Rosario Dawson), the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), a single mother. The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam (Cameron Boyce), who is en route on the Capitol Limited to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. with his school band.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.","target":"Molly","rationale":"The context mentions that Molly is in an elementary school classroom, and she notices that the chalkboard looks blurry to her.

The massive Vladislav Hall  was added to the Royal Palace. New defence towers were also built on the north side of the castle. A large fire in 1541 destroyed large parts of the castle. Under the Habsburgs, some new buildings in Renaissance style were added. Ferdinand I built the Belvedere as a summer palace for his wife Anne. Rudolph II used Prague Castle as his main residence. He founded the northern wing of the palace, with the Spanish Hall, where his precious art collections were exhibited. The Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618 took place at the castle and began the Bohemian Revolt. During the subsequent wars, the Castle was damaged and dilapidated. Many works from  the collection of Rudolph II were looted by Swedes in 1648, in the Battle of Prague  which was the final act of the Thirty Years' War.

Adults generally meet only to court and mate (though limited noncourting socialization has been observed anecdotally) and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, which range from 25 to 40 km2 in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory of a male can contain those of several females. The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.Like the other big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn territorial and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that of two or three females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.The jaguar is often described as nocturnal, but is more specifically crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50â60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.","target":"crepuscular","rationale":"The article mentions that the jaguar is \\"capable of roaring\\" to warn territorial and mating competitors away. This implies that it is an animal, as only animals have this capability. The article also states that they are solitary outside mother-cub groups, suggesting they live in family units.

The squares are arranged in two alternating colors (light and dark). Wooden boards may use naturally light and dark brown woods, while plastic and vinyl boards often use brown or green for the dark squares and shades such as buff or cream for the light squares. Materials vary widely; while wooden boards are generally used in high-level games; vinyl, plastic, and cardboard are common for low-level and informal play. Decorative glass and marble boards are available but rarely accepted for games rated by national or international chess federations. Each square on the board has a name from a1 to h8.\\n\\n- Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64Â squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.

They plan to have the city default on its debt, then foreclose on the entire city, taking over its government. They will then replace the old neighborhoods with Delta City, a new planned city center independent of the United States government.\\nTo rally public opinion behind urban redevelopment and Delta City construction, OCP sparks an increase in street crime. As Detroit Police Department is owned by OCP, they terminate police pension plans and cut salaries, triggering a police strike. RoboCop, due to his directives, is unable to strike and remains on duty with his partner, Anne Lewis. The two raid a manufacturing plant of Nuke, a new designer drug that has been plaguing the streets of Detroit. RoboCop kills all the criminals, except for a young criminal named Hob, who shoots him and escapes.\\nMeanwhile, OCP struggles to develop \\"RoboCop 2\\", which is expected to be mass-produced and completely replace police officers. To their frustration, all the newly resurrected officers immediately commit suicide. Dr. Juliette Faxx, an unscrupulous psychologist, concludes that Alex Murphy's strong sense of duty and his moral objection to suicide due to his Roman Catholic religion were the reasons behind his ability to adapt to his resurrection as RoboCop. Faxx convinces the Old Man to let her control the project, this time using a criminal with a desire for power and immortality. Despite other executives' objection, Faxx is allowed to proceed.\\nNuke's distributor, the power-hungry Cain, feels threatened by the Delta City plan.

It inhibits the effects of thromboxane in vitro. Fifty-six healthy male subjects were given either placebo or three equal daily doses of SQ 28,668 ranging from 25 to 1200 mg. Plasma drug concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner. The shape of the plasma drug concentration-time curve was consistent with enterohepatic recirculation. The effects of SQ 28,668 on ex vivo platelet aggregation suggested that SQ 28,668 is a specific competitive antagonist of thromboxane A2 with a platelet receptor dissociation constant (estimated by Schild analysis) of about 19 nmol/L. Approximately 94% occupation of thromboxane receptors by SQ 28,668 was required to produce a small but measurable increase of the template bleeding time. Dose-ranging studies of antithrombotic drugs are difficult and expensive. For this reason, a method was developed that allows estimation of the dose of a thromboxane receptor antagonist that would be expected to be therapeutically equivalent to a given dose of aspirin. \\nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","target":"Yes","rationale":"The abstract includes numerical data that was collected as part of the study.

About 50% of all homicide victims and motor vehicle drivers killed in Bexar County in 1985 were tested for the presence of cannabinoids. Of 130 homicides and 69 drivers tested, blood was analyzed primarily in all but 15 and 3 cases, respectively. In these latter cases, blood analyzed after urine was found to be positive. Of the homicide victims, 44 (34%), and of all drivers, 19 (28%), tested were positive for one or more of the cannabinoids. As a separate group, 16 motorcycle drivers tested had 38% positive as compared with 25% of the other vehicle drivers. Ethyl alcohol was present in 55% of the drivers, and in 63% of the homicide victims.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century.

Both autologous and allogeneic MSC therapies are possible; however, their safety and efficacy have not been compared.   \\n OBJECTIVE To test whether allogeneic MSCs are as safe and effective as autologous MSCs in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to ICM.   \\n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A phase 1/2 randomized comparison (POSEIDON study) in a US tertiary-care referral hospital of allogeneic and autologous MSCs in 30 patients with LV dysfunction due to ICM between April 2, 2010, and September 14, 2011, with 13-month follow-up.   \\n INTERVENTION Twenty million, 100 million, or 200 million cells (5 patients in each cell type per dose level) were delivered by transendocardial stem cell injection into 10 LV sites.   \\n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Thirty-day postcatheterization incidence of predefined treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs). Efficacy assessments included 6-minute walk test, exercise peak VO2, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), New York Heart Association class, LV volumes, ejection fraction (EF), early enhancement defect (EED; infarct size), and sphericity index.   \\n RESULTS Within 30 days, 1 patient in each group (treatment-emergent SAE rate, 6.7%) was hospitalized for heart failure, less than the prespecified stopping event rate of 25%. The 1-year incidence of SAEs was 33.3% (n = 5) in the allogeneic group and 53.3% (n = 8) in the autologous group (P = .46). At 1 year, there were no ventricular arrhythmia SAEs observed among allogeneic recipients compared with 4 patients (26.7%) in the autologous group (P = .10). Relative to baseline, autologous but not allogeneic MSC therapy was associated with an improvement in the 6-minute walk test and the MLHFQ score, but neither improved exercise VO2 max. Allogeneic and autologous MSCs reduced mean EED by â33.21% (95% CI, â43.61% to â22.81%; P < .001) and sphericity index but did not increase EF. Allogeneic MSCs reduced LV end-diastolic volumes. Low-dose concentration MSCs (20 million cells) produced greatest reductions in LV volumes and increased EF. Allogeneic MSCs did not stimulate significant donor-specific alloimmune reactions.   \\n CONCLUSIONS In this early-stage study of patients with ICM, transendocardial injection of allogeneic and autologous MSCs without a placebo control were both associated with low rates of treatment-emergent SAEs, including immunologic reactions. In aggregate, MSC injection favorably affected patient functional capacity, quality of life, and ventricular remodeling.   \\n TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01087996.","target":"True","rationale":"The abstract includes a topic sentence that states the objective of the study (\\"To test whether allogeneic MSCs are as safe and effective as autologous MSCs in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to ICM.\\"), relevant supporting sentences that describe the methods and results of the study, and a closing sentence that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the study.

Snakes? No problem. Walking alone in the dark? Easy. We're not talking about a superhero here -- SM is a 44-year-old mother.  And she's fearless because she happens to be missing part of her brain: the amygdala .\\nShaped like a pair of almonds sitting in the middle of your brain, the amygdala helps control fear and anxiety. A rare condition called Urbach-Wiethe disease left SM without her amygdala, and seems to have completely erased her sense of fear.\\nTo try to understand how the amygdala works, a team of researchers made their efforts to scare SM. They showed her horror movies and took her to the Waverly Hills Sanatorium Haunted House in Kentucky. She pushed out one of the monsters  and laughed. SM said she didn't like snakes, but at a pet store full of poisonous creatures, she kept asking to touch them. When asked to rate her feelings, SM reported feeling surprised or disgusted, but never fearful.\\n\\"She tends to approach everything she should be avoiding,\\" says Justin Feinstein of the  University of Iowa. This means the amygdala could control deeper urges to approach or avoid danger. Other scientists have a different opinion, though.  \\"I don't believe you can make a general statement about what the amygdala does by a single case study,\\" Elizabeth Phelps said. In 2002, Phelps published a study on a similar patient with amygdala damage who still showed fear.\\nIt may sound like fun to be totally fearless, but we get scared for a good reason. \\"The nature of fear is survival and the amygdala helps us stay alive by avoiding situations, people, or objects that put our life in danger,\\" Feinstein said. SM was once followed in a park after dark by a man with a knife, and she simply walked away. \\"It is quite remarkable that she is still alive,\\" said Feinstein.\\nQuestion: SM dares to walk alone in the dark mainly because   _  .\\nOptions: A: she is a superhero\\nB: she has experienced such conditions a lot\\nC: she is a mental patient\\nD: she has no sense of fear","target":"D","rationale":"The story explains that SM has no sense of fear, and she is not afraid to walk alone in the dark. This implies that her lack of fear may have been caused by damage to a part of her brain called the amygdala.\\nSo it can be inferred from this context that SM dares to walk alone in the dark mainly because she has no sense of fear.

That game, coincidentally, was Kirk Cousins' first appearance in an NFL game. Three years later, now as the starter, he was attempting to lead Washington to their first 3-2 start since 2011. He faced a stern test though, as his career TD-INT ratio on the road was 11-13, and he had never played in a road game without throwing at least one interception. Washington was only able to run four plays on their first drive before having to punt to Atlanta. The Falcons were able to cross midfield before quarterback Matt Ryan's pass to superstar receiver Julio Jones was tipped and intercepted by Redskins safety Trenton Robinson; it was Washington's first interception of the season. Nearing the end of a scoreless first quarter, the Redskins tried to accumulate some momentum in the running game, as their longest run so far had been only 4 yards. Alfred Morris and Matt Jones both saw action, but it was the passing game that began to heat up. The two longest plays on the drive were a 14-yard pass to Chris Thompson and a 21-yarder to Pierre Gar&#231;on. The drive culminated in tight end Derek Carrier's first career touchdown pass, a 7-yard throw from Cousins that gave the Redskins a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter. Atlanta responded with a methodical drive, including only 2 plays longer than 7 yards, to get on the board. Kicker Matt Bryant connected on a 42-yard field goal and the Falcons cut the deficit to 7-3. Washington's next drive was not as effective, with only one out of five plays gaining positive yards before Cousins threw deep and was intercepted by Falcons cornerback Robert Alford, who returned the ball into Redskins territory. Of the 8 career road games in which Cousins had now played, he totaled 14 interceptions, and had thrown at least one interception in each. The Falcons now needed to capitalize on the turnover, and advanced the ball to the Redskins' 23-yard-line, easily within field goal range. Defensive end Chris Baker had other ideas, sacking Ryan on 3rd and 3 and forcing a fumble, which was recovered by linebacker Will Compton. However, Atlanta regained possession with 1:39 left and all three of their timeouts. Running back Devonta Freeman and tight end Jacob Tamme helped get the Falcons into field goal range, but Bryant missed a short 38-yard attempt, bouncing the ball off of the right upright. Entering halftime, undefeated Atlanta trailed Washington 7-3 at home. The Falcons began the second half aggressively, throwing on 6 of their first 7 plays. This got them into field goal range. Bryant attempted to redeem himself for the earlier miss, but this kick bounced off the left upright. The ensuing Redskins drive utilized several short Cousins passes to get into field goal range, although Hopkins missed the 53-yard attempt. Atlanta crossed midfield on their next drive, and faced a decision on 4th-and-6 from the Redskins' 40-yard-line, just outside of Bryant's range. Ryan threw to Jones, his most reliable target, for a gain of 9 and the first down. Two plays later, Bashaud Breeland was called for a horse-collar tackle, which moved the ball from the Redskins' 30-yard-line to the 15. This was close enough for Bryant to convert a field goal, and Atlanta had crept within one of Washington, 7-6. Still unable to move the ball effectively, the Redskins went three-and-out to give the ball back to Atlanta. Washington then struggled on defense as well, allowing 4 plays of 10+ yards. Chris Baker forced a Freeman fumble at the goal line, but Julio Jones jumped on the ball in the endzone for the go-ahead score. Falcons first-year head coach Dan Quinn opted to attempt a two-point conversion to go up by a full seven points, but Ryan's pass fell incomplete to keep the lead at 12-7. The Atlanta drive covered 91 yards in just 11 plays, and now only 9 minutes remained in the game. With their lead gone, and having been shut out in the second half, the Redskins began a crucial drive from their own 20-yard-line. A 10-yard pass and a 26-yard pass, both to rookie receiver Jamison Crowder, were followed by a deep attempt to fellow rookie Rashad Ross. The ball fell incomplete, but Atlanta defensive back Robert Alford was assessed a 42-yard pass interference penalty that gave Washington the ball on the 2-yard line. On the next play, Matt Jones completed the all-rookie drive with a touchdown, allowing Washington to regain the lead, 13-12. Redskins coach Jay Gruden attempted a two-point conversion to extend the margin to a field goal, but it, like the Falcons' attempt, fell incomplete. Atlanta then committed a surprising turnover, a Ryan pass intercepted by Breeland, who returned the ball all the way back to the Atlanta 21-yard-line. This allowed the Redskins to extend the lead to 16-12, significant because Atlanta now needed a touchdown to win instead of a field goal. Atlanta's next 6 plays covered 67 yards, followed by an apparent 13-yard touchdown pass on 3rd and 2; however, the play was later ruled an incomplete pass because Freeman did not maintain possession of the ball as he fell to the ground. The Falcons had to convert the next play, a 4th and 2, to keep any hope of a perfect season. Veteran receiver Roddy White made the catch, and Freeman redeemed himself on the next play with a touchdown, resulting in a 19-16 Falcons lead. They had run the clock down to 24 seconds, leaving almost no time for the Redskins to respond, but Washington still had all three timeouts. Their next three plays, gains of 20, 19, and 7 to Carrier, Garcon, and Crowder, took only 19 seconds, leaving 5 seconds for a 52-yard attempt at a game-tying field goal. Hopkins drilled the kick, tying the game at 19-19, and the game went into overtime. In 24 previous meetings, dating back to 1966, the Redskins and Falcons had never gone into overtime, and Atlanta had won the last four meetings. The Redskins won the coin toss and began overtime on offense. A Crowder 17-yard catch moved them near midfield, only needing about 20 more yards to get into Hopkins' range. Three plays later, though, Cousins attempted to pass to rookie receiver Ryan Grant, but Grant slipped on the route, allowing Robert Alford to intercept the pass and return it 59 yards for a touchdown, a 25-19 Falcons win, and their second 5-0 start in franchise history. For the Redskins, the heartbreaking loss was the second time in four seasons they had lost to Atlanta in Week 5 by 7 points or fewer. Cousins moved to 0-3 in his career against the Falcons and threw the 15th career interception on the road in only 8 games. In each of Washington's three losses, Cousins had thrown 2 interceptions; in their two wins, he had not thrown any.\\n\\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

He is best known for his career with the Brumbies in Super Rugby, for whom he played from the inception of the professional Super 12 in 1996 through 2007, and his long tenure with the Wallabies at international level, for whom he played 102 times. After initial selection at fullback from 1996 to 1997, Larkham was the first-choice Australian fly-half from 1997 to 2007, playing in the 1999, 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups. He is married to Jacqueline and has two children, Jaimee and Tiahna.\\n\\nLarkham's famous 48m-drop goal to seal victory over South Africa in extra time of the 1999 Rugby World Cup Semi-Final has gone down in rugby folklore as the defining moment in the Wallabies' victorious Rugby World Cup campaign. South Africa had got to the semi final largely through the efforts of Jannie de Beer kicking 5 drop goals in their previous match. By contrast not one of the Australian players on the team had to that date ever scored a drop goal at test level. The fact that Larkham had quite a badly injured knee through the match caused Steve Smith to remark incredulously while calling the game for English ITV \\"He can barely stand on that leg and yet he just thwacked it over.\\"  The feat was even more remarkable as Larkham's eyesight was very poor at the time. Since 1999 he has had laser surgery to correct his vision, however at the time he could not see the goal posts clearly. Following Australia's victory over France in the World Cup final, several television commercials aired in Australia humorously mocking Larkham's lack of kicking prowess. The commercial featured current & former teammates, junior and senior coaches (including former Australian coach Rod MacQueen) and even Australian rugby icons (such as Phil Kearns) expressing their astonishment that Larkham managed to score.  The commercial begins with Larkham's school coaches saying he was a poor kicker, and had never successfully scored a drop-goal in a match. The climax of the commercial features then-captain John Eales, as well as Matt Burke, Kearns and MacQueen each saying \\"Don't kick it!\\" as footage of the moment is replayed. The commercial is available to view on YouTube.\\n\\nEntity:","target":"Stephen Larkham","rationale":"The context is about Stephen Larkham, a former Australian rugby player.
